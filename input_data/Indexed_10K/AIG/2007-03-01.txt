Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIGs insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross references to additional information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative explanation of AIGs operations, financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters.

These projections and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIGs belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIGs control. These projections and statements may address, among other things, the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against AIG and their potential effect on AIGs businesses, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, the effect of credit rating changes on AIGs businesses and competitive position, the unwinding and resolving of various relationships between AIG and SICO and AIGs strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves. It is possible that AIGs actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these projections and statements. Factors that could cause AIGs actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific projections and statements are discussed throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligations) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 25 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Overview of Operations and Business Results AIG identifies its reportable segments by product or service line, consistent with its management structure. AIGs major product and service groupings are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. AIGs operations in 2006 were conducted by its subsidiaries through these segments. Through these segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic, product and service diversification is one of AIGs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. AIGs Other category consists of items not allocated to AIGs operating segments. AIGs subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well. AIGs Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals. As part of its spread based business activities, AIG issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets. AIGs operating performance reflects implementation of various long term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection, and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risks accepted and expenses incurred. Expense efficiency is also a primary goal of AIG. A central focus of AIG operations in recent years has been the development and expansion of distribution channels. In 2006, AIG continued to expand its distribution channels, which now include banks, credit card companies, television media home shopping, affinity groups, direct response, worksite marketing and e commerce. AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities. For example, the fact that AIG has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eleven cities in China is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIGs more recent extensions of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy. Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIGs products evolve with them, to more sophisticated and investment oriented models. Growth for AIG may be generated internally as well as through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on capital. During 2006, AIG acquired Travel Guard International, one of the nations leading providers of travel insurance programs and emergency travel assistance, and acquired Central Insurance Co., Ltd., a leading general insurance company in Taiwan. Outlook The commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophe or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage. Despite industry price erosion in commercial lines, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of AIGs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the U.S. and abroad. Workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure, as statutory rates continue to decline. Rates for D&O insurance also continue to decline due to competitive pressures. There can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that AIGs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines, as well as in personal lines and specialty coverages, such as mortgage guaranty, where the loss ratio has increased due to softening in the U.S. housing market and the weakening performance of non traditional mortgage products. In Foreign General, opportunities for growth exist in the consumer lines due to increased demand in emerging markets and the trend toward privatization of health insurance. Growth in the Personal Lines marketplace remains challenged from flat renewal pricing, consumer price shopping and increased advertising spending by market leaders. However, the high net worth market continues to provide opportunities for growth as a result of AIGs innovative products and services specifically designed for that market. AIG expects that the acquisition of the remaining interest in 21st Century will enhance AIGs ability to grow the Personal Lines business while gaining efficiencies of scale. Losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of results more difficult. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and adequate reinsurance coverage, to reduce the effect of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIGs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. AIGs operations in China continue to expand, but AIG expects competition in China to remain strong and AIGs success in China will depend on its ability to execute its growth strategy. In India, AIG expects to grow all segments, both organically and through acquisitions and joint ventures. In Japan, AIG expects its Life Insurance & Retirement Services earnings growth may be challenged by increased competition in light of a new industry wide mortality table, the continued runoff of the older, higher margin in force business of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life and lower consumer demand for certain accident and health products in light of tax law changes. The flat yield curve and declining Yen foreign exchange environment may continue to constrain certain fixed annuity production. To leverage 26 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGs leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks in Japan, ALICO launched new life products in this distribution channel. Although ALICOs direct marketing activities in Japan could experience a contraction while it re positions its brand and products in a very competitive market, AIG expects that further deregulation will provide additional growth opportunities. In addition, AIG expects that the planned integration of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life will provide enhanced distribution opportunities and scale economies with an anticipated completion date of 2009. AIG is a leader in direct marketing through sponsors and in the broad market in Japan and Korea, and AIG is investing in expanding distribution channels in India, Korea and Vietnam. Through new operations in Bahrain designed to comply with Islamic law, AIG is tapping into a growing market. Islamic insurance, called Takaful, is an alternative to conventional insurance based on the concept of mutual assistance through pooling of resources. Domestically, AIG plans to continue expansion of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses through direct marketing and independent agent distribution channels. The aging population in the U.S. provides a growth opportunity for a variety of products, including longevity, guaranteed income and supplemental accident and health products. Certain other demographic groups that have traditionally been underserved provide additional growth opportunities. The home service operation, a slow growth business, has not met business objectives, although its cash flow has been steady. Domestic group life/health operations continue to face competitors with greater scale in group benefits. At the end of 2006, AIG exited the financial institutions credit life business in the U.S. as a result of competition from bank products and low profit margins. The individual fixed annuities business will continue to be challenged due to the interest rate environment and increased competition from bank products, while lower margin variable annuity products with living benefits will continue to be the product of consumer choice in the individual variable annuity markets. The group annuity market is undergoing a transition from group annuities to mutual fund products that have lower profit margins. Globally, heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial services companies in many jurisdictions has the potential to affect future financial results through higher compliance costs. This is particularly true in Japan and Southeast Asia where financial institutions have received remediation orders affecting consumer and policyholder rights. Within Financial Services, demand for ILFCs modern, fuel efficient aircraft remains strong, and ILFC plans to increase its fleet by purchasing 83 aircraft in 2007. However, ILFCs margins may be adversely affected by further increases in interest rates. AIGFP expects opportunities for growth across its product segments, but AIGFP is a transaction oriented business, and its operating results will depend to a significant extent on actual transaction flow, which can be affected by market conditions and other variables outside its control. AIG continues to explore opportunities to expand its Consumer Finance operations into new foreign markets. Consumer Finance operations overseas were negatively affected in 2006 by industry wide credit deterioration in the Taiwan credit card market, however, and operating results in the U.S. could be affected by the residential housing market, interest rates and unemployment. The GIC portfolio, which is reported within the Asset Management segment, continues to run off and the MIP has replaced the GIC program as AIGs principal institutional spread based investment activity. The MIP program is expected to continue to grow in 2007. Because the asset mix under the MIP does not include the alternative investments utilized in the GIC program, however, AIG does not expect that the income growth in the MIP will offset the runoff in the GIC portfolio for the foreseeable future. For a description of important factors that may affect the operations and initiatives described above, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Consolidated Results The following table summarizes AIGs consolidated revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total revenues $ 113,194 $ 108,905 $ 97,666 Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes 21,687 15,213 14,845 Net income $ 14,048 $ 10,477 $ 9,839 2006 and 2005 Comparison The 4 percent growth in revenues in 2006 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned and net investment income from General Insurance operations and growth in Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums and net investment income. Revenues in the Financial Services segment declined as a result of the effect of hedging activities for AIGFP that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, decreasing revenues by $1.8 billion in 2006 and increasing revenues by $2.01 billion in 2005. Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 43 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting higher General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income. These increases were partially offset by lower Financial Services operating income reflecting the effects of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Results in Form 10 K 2006 AIG 27 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 2005 reflected the negative effect of $3.28 billion (pre tax) in catastrophe related losses incurred that year. Net income in 2005 also reflected the charges related to regulatory settlements, as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and the fourth quarter charge resulting from the annual review of General Insurance loss and loss adjustment reserves. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Revenues grew 12 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in net premiums earned from General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. Hedging activities for AIGFP that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 caused an increase in Financial Services revenues of $2.01 billion in 2005 and a decrease of $122 million in 2004. AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 2 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains accounted for the increase over 2004 in both pretax income and net income. Offsetting these gains was the effect of the charges related to regulatory settlements. Remediation and Other Items Throughout 2006, as part of its continuing remediation efforts, AIG recorded out of period adjustments. The net effect of out of period adjustments relating to prior years increased 2006 net income by $65 million. The more significant adjustments included increases in unit investment trust income of $773 million ($428 million after tax) (more fully described below) and other expenses of $356 million ($231 million after tax), and a decrease in revenues for certain derivative transactions of $300 million ($145 million after tax). During the fourth quarter, as part of its ongoing remediation efforts, AIG recorded out of period adjustments. These adjustments collectively increased net income in the fourth quarter by $56 million but were offset by fourth quarter charges to expense within Domestic Life for the adverse ruling in the Superior National arbitration of $125 million ($81 million after tax) and a charge of $66 million ($43 million after tax) in connection with the exit of the financial institutions credit life business. The more significant out of period adjustments included the following: a decrease in income tax expense of $181 million relating to AIGs ongoing remediation of internal controls over income tax accounting, an increase in other expenses of $167 million ($109 million after tax) relating to AIGs remediation of internal controls over reconciliation of certain balance sheet accounts, an increase in incurred policy losses and benefits of $103 million ($67 million after tax) in Domestic General Insurance for corrections of certain reserves for losses and loss expenses, a reduction in incurred policy benefits in the Foreign Life participating policyholder fund stemming from deferred tax adjustments in Foreign Life of $190 million ($124 million after tax), an increase in insurance operating expenses of $61 million ($40 million after tax) within Foreign Life for corrections of expense allocations to certain par fund accounts, and a $79 million ($51 million after tax) charge related to purchases of life insurance policies for AIGs life settlements portfolio that were issued by AIG subsidiaries. During 2006, AIG identified and recorded out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts in accordance with FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. These investments had previously been accounted for as available for sale securities, with changes in market values being reflected in other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. Beginning with the second quarter of 2006, the changes in market values are included in net investment income. The adjustments decreased unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments net of reclassification adjustments, and the related deferred income tax benefit (expense), in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) by approximately $659 million and approximately $231 million, respectively, and increased net investment income by $844 million, increased Incurred policy losses and benefits (related to certain participating policyholder funds) by $71 million, increased Income taxes by $231 million and increased minority interest expense by $114 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no effect on Total shareholders equity at December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005. Results for 2006 were negatively affected by a one time charge relating to the Starr tender offer ($54 million before and after tax) and an additional allowance for losses in AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) ($94 million before and after tax). The effective income tax rate increased from 28.0 percent for 2005 to 30.1 percent for 2006, reflecting changes in the sources of foreign taxable income, the effect of the phase out of synfuel tax credits, the effect of consolidating certain limited partnerships and a reduction in the proportion of total income derived from tax exempt income, which was partially offset by the aforementioned out of period income tax adjustments. There were no significant catastrophe related losses for the year ended December 31, 2006. The following table summarizes the net effect of catastrophe related losses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. (in millions) 2005 2004 Pretax* $ 3,280 $ 1,155 Net of tax and minority interest 2,109 729 * Includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe related losses from partially owned companies in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 28 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Segment Results The following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues(a): General Insurance(b)(c) $ 49,206 $ 45,174 $ 41,961 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(c)(d) 50,163 47,376 43,402 Financial Services(e)(f) 8,010 10,525 7,495 Asset Management(g) 5,814 5,325 4,714 Other(h) 1 505 94 Total $ 113,194 $ 108,905 $ 97,666 Operating Income(a)(i)(j): General Insurance(c) $ 10,412 $ 2,315 $ 3,177 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(c) 10,032 8,904 7,925 Financial Services(f) 524 4,276 2,180 Asset Management 2,346 2,253 2,125 Other(h)(k) (1,627 ) (2,535 ) (562 ) Total $ 21,687 $ 15,213 $ 14,845 (a) Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the effect was $(1.86) billion, $2.02 billion and $385 million in revenues and $(1.86) billion, $2.02 billion and $671 million in operating income. These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are hedging available for sale securities and borrowings. (b) Represents the sum of General Insurance net premiums earned, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). (c) Includes the effect of out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts. For 2006, the effect was an increase of $490 million in both revenues and operating income for General Insurance and an increase of $240 million and $169 million in revenues and operating income, respectively, for Life Insurance & Retirement Services. (d) Represents the sum of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). Included in realized capital gains (losses) and operating income is the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 and the application of FAS 52, of $355 million, $(495) million and $(140) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (e) Represents interest, lease and finance charges. (f) Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the effect was $(1.82) billion, $2.01 billion, and $(122) million in both revenues and operating income for Capital Markets. These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are economically hedging available for sale securities and borrowings. For 2004, the effect was $(27) million in operating income for Aircraft Leasing. During 2006 and 2005, Aircraft Leasing derivative gains and losses were reported as part of AIGs Other category, and were not reported in Aircraft Leasing operating income. (g) Represents net investment income with respect to spread based products and management and advisory fees. (h) Includes consolidation and elimination adjustments which increased revenues and operating income by $296 million and $74 million, respectively, in 2006. (i) Represents income before income taxes, minority interest, and cumulative effect of accounting changes. (j) Includes current year catastrophe related losses of $3.28 billion and $1.16 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no significant catastrophe related losses in 2006. Includes additional losses incurred and net reinstatement premiums related to prior year catastrophes of $165 million and $292 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. (k) Includes current year catastrophe related losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $312 million and $96 million in 2005 and 2004. There were no significant catastrophe related losses in 2006. General Insurance AIGs General Insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world. The increase in General Insurance operating income in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an improvement in underwriting results for DBG, including the absence of catastrophe related losses, which amounted to $2.89 billion in 2005. Operating income for 2006 also reflected higher net investment income, including the effect of the out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts. Life Insurance & Retirement Services AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations provide insurance, financial and investment products throughout the world. Foreign operations contributed approximately 68 percent, 59 percent and 61 percent of AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income increased 13 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 on higher GAAP premiums and an increase in net investment income. Net investment income in 2006 included the effect of an out of period adjustment related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts. Realized capital gains included in revenues and operating income were $88 million in 2006 compared to realized capital losses of $158 million in 2005. Results for 2006 were particularly strong in the Foreign Life operations that were helped by increased net investment income, higher realized gains and lower acquisition costs. Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income declined from the prior year on lower realized gains, the charge discussed above relating to the Superior National arbitration and the exiting of the financial institutions credit insurance business. Financial Services AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Financial Services operating income decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the effects of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting in the first quarter of 2007 for AIGFP. In addition to the effects of FAS 133, fluctuations in revenues and operating income from period to Form 10 K 2006 AIG 29 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued period are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of Capital Markets operations. Asset Management AIGs Asset Management operations include institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer services and institutional spread based investment businesses. The MIP has replaced the GIC program as AIGs principal spread based investment activity. Asset Management operating income increased 4 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to growth in asset management fees within Institutional Asset Management and income from the MIP. These increases were partially offset by the continued runoff of GIC balances, spread compression in the remaining GIC portfolio as well as decreased performance based fees. Gains and losses arising from the consolidation of certain variable interest entities (VIEs) and partnerships are included in operating income, but are offset in minority interest expense, which is not a component of operating income. Capital Resources At December 31, 2006, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $101.68 billion and total consolidated borrowings of $148.68 billion. At that date, $131.55 billion of such borrowings were not guaranteed by AIG, were matched borrowings by AIG or AIGFP, or represented liabilities connected to trust preferred stock. AIG did not purchase shares of its common stock under its common stock repurchase authorization during 2006. In February 2007, AIGs Board of Directors increased the repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase of shares with an aggregate purchase price of $8 billion. In 2007, AIG expects to issue capital securities in one or more series. The proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of common stock or to otherwise improve the efficiency of AIGs capital structure. Liquidity AIG manages liquidity at both the subsidiary and parent company levels. At December 31, 2006, AIGs consolidated invested assets, primarily held by its subsidiaries, included $26.8 billion in cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2006 amounted to $6.8 billion. At the parent company level, liquidity management activities are conducted in a manner to preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and diversity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions. AIGs primary sources of cash flow are dividends and other payments from its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as issuances of debt securities. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, subsidiary funding and shareholder dividend payments. Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet its anticipated cash requirements, including the funding of increased dividends under AIGs new dividend policy and repurchases of common stock. Critical Accounting Estimates AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates to be those relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, recoverability of DAC, estimated gross profits for investment oriented products, fair value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities, other than temporary declines in the value of investments and flight equipment recoverability. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIGs results of operations would be directly affected. Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIGs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below. For a discussion regarding the significant accounting policies relating to these estimates, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses (General Insurance): Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2006 for the year end 2006 loss reserve analysis. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount. Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses: the expected recoveries from reinsurers on losses that have not yet been reported and or settled. Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services): Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products. Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution channel. Estimated Gross Profits (Life Insurance & Retirement Services): Estimated gross profits: to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment oriented products) affect the carrying value of DAC, unearned revenue liability and associated amortization patterns under FAS 97 and Sales Inducement Assets under SOP 03 1. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses. 30 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (Life Insurance & Retirement Services): Recoverability: based on current and future expected profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign exchange rates, mortality experience, and policy persistency. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance): Recoverability and eligibility: based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Fair Value Determinations Of Certain Assets And Liabilities (Financial Services): SD Valuation models: utilizing factors, such as market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. Market price data: AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data, such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in its models. When such data is not available, AIG uses an internal methodology, which includes interpolation and extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions. Other Than Temporary Declines In The Value Of Investments: A security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if lower) for an extended period of time (nine months or longer); The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization; or The probability of non realization of a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its securities holdings in an unrealized loss position. Where AIG does not intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered their carrying value, based on the circumstances present at the date of evaluation, AIG records the unrealized loss in income. If events or circumstances change, such as unexpected changes in the creditworthiness of the obligor, unanticipated changes in interest rates, tax laws, statutory capital positions and unforeseen liquidity events, among others, AIG revisits its intent. Further, if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to these unexpected changes in circumstances, the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment loss for debt securities, AIG amortizes the discount or reduced premium over the remaining life of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. Flight Equipment Recoverability (Financial Services): Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on third party information. Operating Review General Insurance Operations AIGs General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of commercial property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad. As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses certain regulatory measures, where AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful. A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce profit from underwriting activities exclusive of investment related income. When underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may, however, enable a general insurance business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting results to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance. See also Liquidity herein. Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses (including acquisition costs) are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. Thus, statutory expenses exclude changes in DAC. GAAP provides for the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned. DAC is reviewed for recoverability, and such review requires management judgment. The most comparable GAAP measure to statutory underwriting profit is income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change. A table reconciling statutory underwriting profit to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change is contained in footnote (g) to the following table. See also Critical Accounting Estimates herein and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIG, along with most general insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the Form 10 K 2006 AIG 31 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. General Insurance Results General Insurance operating income is comprised of statutory underwriting results, changes in DAC, net investment income and realized capital gains and losses. Operating income, as well as net premiums written, net premiums earned, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses) and statutory ratios for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (in millions, except ratios) 2006 2005 2004 Net premiums written: Domestic General DBG $ 24,345 $ 23,128 $ 22,506 Transatlantic 3,633 3,466 3,749 Personal Lines 4,654 4,653 4,354 Mortgage Guaranty 866 628 607 Foreign General(a) 11,368 9,997 9,407 Total $ 44,866 $ 41,872 $ 40,623 Net premiums earned: Domestic General DBG $ 23,936 $ 22,602 $ 21,215 Transatlantic 3,604 3,385 3,661 Personal Lines 4,645 4,634 4,291 Mortgage Guaranty 740 533 539 Foreign General(a) 10,526 9,655 8,831 Total $ 43,451 $ 40,809 $ 38,537 Net investment income(b): Domestic General DBG $ 3,411 $ 2,403 $ 1,965 Transatlantic 435 343 307 Personal Lines 225 217 186 Mortgage Guaranty 140 123 120 Intercompany adjustments and eliminations net 1 1 Foreign General 1,484 944 618 Total $ 5,696 $ 4,031 $ 3,196 Realized capital gains (losses) $ 59 $ 334 $ 228 Operating income (loss)(b)(c)(d): Domestic General DBG $ 5,985 $ (646 ) $ 777 Transatlantic 589 (39 ) 282 Personal Lines 432 195 357 Mortgage Guaranty 328 363 399 Foreign General(e) 3,088 2,427 1,344 Reclassifications and eliminations (10 ) 15 18 Total $ 10,412 $ 2,315 $ 3,177 Statutory underwriting profit (loss)(c)(d)(g): Domestic General DBG $ 2,450 $ (3,227 ) $ (1,500 ) Transatlantic 129 (434 ) (77 ) Personal Lines 204 (38 ) 136 Mortgage Guaranty 188 249 234 Foreign General(e) 1,437 1,285 643 Total $ 4,408 $ (2,165 ) $ (564 ) (continued) 32 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (in millions, except ratios) 2006 2005 2004 Domestic General(c)(d): Loss ratio 69.1 89.6 83.9 Expense ratio 21.5 21.0 19.2 Combined ratio 90.6 110.6 103.1 Foreign General(c)(d): Loss ratio(a) 50.5 53.7 61.6 Expense ratio(e)(f) 33.2 31.9 29.2 Combined ratio 83.7 85.6 90.8 Consolidated(c)(d): Loss ratio 64.6 81.1 78.8 Expense ratio 24.5 23.6 21.5 Combined ratio 89.1 104.7 100.3 (a) Income statement accounts expressed in non functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates.

The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of General Insurance net premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. 2006 2005 Growth in original currency* 7.4 % 2.6 % Foreign exchange effect (0.2 ) 0.5 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 7.2 % 3.1 % * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period. 2006 and 2005 Comparison General Insurance operating income increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to growth in net premiums, a reduction in both catastrophe losses and prior accident year development, and growth in net investment income. The combined ratio improved to 89.1, a reduction of 15.6 points from 2005, including an improvement in the loss ratio of 16.5 points. The reduction in catastrophe losses represented 6.9 points and the reduction in prior year adverse development represented 11.5 points of the overall reduction. Net premiums written increased $3.0 billion or 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Domestic General accounted for $1.6 billion of the increase as property rates improved and submission activity increased due to the strength of AIGs capacity, commitment to difficult markets and diverse product offerings. Foreign General contributed $1.4 billion to the increase in net premiums written. In 2005, Domestic General net premiums written increased by $300 million and Foreign General net premiums written decreased by the same amount as a result of the commutation of the Richmond reinsurance contract. The commutation partially offset the increase in Domestic General net premiums written in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased Foreign General net premiums written in 2006 compared to 2005. In 2006, certain adjustments were made in conjunction with the remediation of the material weakness relating to balance sheet account reconciliations which increased earned premiums by $189 million and increased other expenses by $415 million. These adjustments reflect continuing progress in AIGs ongoing remediation efforts. The combined effect of these adjustments increased the expense ratio by 0.9 points and decreased the loss ratio by 0.3 points. General Insurance net investment income increased $1.67 billion in 2006 to $5.7 billion on higher levels of invested assets, strong cash flows, slightly higher yields and increased partnership income, and included increases from out of period adjustments of $490 million related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts, $43 million related to partnership income and $85 million related to interest earned on a DBG deposit contract. See also Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity and Invested Assets herein. 2005 and 2004 Comparison General Insurance operating income in 2005 decreased from 2004 due to higher catastrophe related losses and the fourth quarter 2005 increase in reserves and changes in estimates related to remediation of the material weakness in reconciliation of balance sheet accounts. Catastrophe related losses were $2.89 billion and $1.05 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by strong growth in statutory underwriting profit and increases in net investment income. General Insurance operating income in 2004 also included a $232 million charge reflecting a change in estimate for salvage and subrogation recoveries. General Insurance net investment income grew in 2005 compared to 2004 due to strong cash flows, higher interest rates and increased partnership income. See also Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity herein and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DBG Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison DBGs operating income increased to $5.99 billion in 2006 compared to a loss of $646 million in 2005, an improvement of $6.63 billion. The improvement is also reflected in the combined ratio, which declined to 89.4 in 2006 compared to 113.8 in 2005 primarily due to an improvement in the loss ratio of 24.9 points. The reduction in prior year adverse development and the reduction in catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums accounted for 21.0 points and 8.2 points, respectively, of the improvement. DBGs net premiums written increased 5 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 as property rates improved and submission activity increased due to the strength of AIGs capacity, commitment to difficult markets and diverse product offerings. Net premiums written in 2005 were reduced by $122 million due to reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes, offset by increases of $300 million for the Richmond commutation and $147 million related to an accrual for workers compensation premiums for payroll not yet reported by insured employers. The combined effect of these items reduced the growth rate for net premiums written by 1.5 percent. The loss ratio for 2006 declined 24.9 points to 69.4. The 2005 loss ratio was negatively affected by catastrophe related losses of $1.7 billion and related reinstatement premiums of $122 million. Adverse development on reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses declined to $110 million in 2006 compared to $4.9 billion in 2005, accounting for 21.0 points of the decrease in the loss ratio. DBGs expense ratio increased to 20.0 in 2006 compared to 19.5 in 2005, primarily due to an increase in other expenses that amounted to $498 million in 2006 (including out of period charges of $356 million) compared to $372 million in 2005. This increase added 0.4 points to the expense ratio. Overall allowances decreased, however, due to charge offs against previously established allowances resulting from AIGs remediation activities. DBGs net investment income increased by $1.0 billion in 2006 compared to 2005, as interest income increased $482 million on growth in the bond portfolio resulting from investment of operating cash flows and capital contributions. Partnership income 34 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries increased from 2005 due to improved performance of the underlying investments, including initial public offering activity. Net investment income in 2006 included increases relating to out of period adjustments of $109 million for the accounting for certain investments in unit investment trusts and partnerships and $85 million related to interest earned on a deposit contract that did not exist in the prior year. 2005 and 2004 Comparison DBGs net premiums written increased modestly in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting generally improving renewal retention rates and a modest change in the mix of business towards smaller accounts for which DBG purchases less reinsurance. DBG also continued to expand its relationships with a larger number and broader range of brokers. DBG saw improvement in domestic property rates as well as increases in submission activity in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes. DBG attributes the increase in submissions to its overall financial strength in comparison to many insurers that experienced significant losses and reductions of surplus as a result of the hurricanes. The DBG loss ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally as a result of adverse loss development, higher catastrophe related losses and $197 million of losses incurred in 2005 resulting from the 2004 catastrophes. The DBG expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004, principally due to an increase in net commissions resulting from the replacement of certain ceded quota share reinsurance, for which DBG earns a ceding commission, with excess of loss reinsurance, which generally does not include a ceding commission. Increases in other underwriting expenses reflect a change in estimates for salvage and subrogation recoveries. DBGs net investment income increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to strong cash flows, higher interest rates and increased partnership income. Transatlantic Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison Transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned increased in 2006 by 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively, compared to 2005 due primarily to increased writings in domestic operations. Operating income increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due largely to lower catastrophe losses and net ceded reinstatement premiums, and increased net investment income. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned for 2005 decreased compared to 2004, principally due to competitive market conditions and increased ceding company retentions in certain classes of business, largely resulting from Transatlantics domestic operations. Operating income decreased principally as a result of the increased level of catastrophe losses. Personal Lines Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison Personal Lines operating income increased $237 million in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a reduction in the loss ratio of 5.8 points. Favorable development on prior accident years reduced incurred losses by $111 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $14 million in 2005, accounting for 2.7 points of the decrease in the loss ratio. The 2005 catastrophe related losses of $112 million added 2.4 points to the loss ratio. The loss ratio for the 2006 accident year improved 0.7 points primarily due to the termination of The Robert Plan relationship effective December 31, 2005 and growth in the Private Client Group. The improvement in the loss ratio was partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio of 0.6 points primarily due to investments in people and technology, national expansion efforts and lower response rates. Net premiums written were flat in 2006 compared to 2005, with growth in the Private Client Group and Agency Auto divisions offset by termination of The Robert Plan relationship. Growth in the Private Client Group spans multiple products, with a continued penetration of the high net worth market, strong brand promotion and innovative loss prevention programs. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Personal Lines net premiums written and net premiums earned for 2005 increased compared to 2004 as a result of strong growth in the Private Client Group and Agency Auto divisions due to increased agent/broker appointments, greater market penetration and enhanced product offerings. AIG direct premiums in 2005 were down slightly from 2004 due to aggressive re underwriting of the previously acquired GE business and the discontinuation of underwriting homeowners business. Involuntary auto premiums were down in 2005 due to the decline in the assigned risk marketplace. Statutory underwriting profit declined in 2005 as a result of hurricane losses and related expenses, reserve strengthening, an increase in Agency Autos current accident year physical damage loss ratio, and expenses incurred related to terminating AIGs relationship with The Robert Plan effective December 31, 2005. Mortgage Guaranty Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison UGCs operating income declined $35 million in 2006, down 10 percent from 2005 due primarily to unfavorable loss experience on third party originated second lien business with a credit quality lower than typical for UGC and a softening U.S. housing market. This increased UGCs consolidated loss ratio for 2006 to 47.2 compared to 26.0 in 2005. The writing of this second lien coverage, which began in 2005, was discontinued as of year end 2006. Losses in the second lien business have been mitigated by a policy year aggregate limitation provision that is typically established for each lender. Net premiums written increased 38 percent from growth in the domestic second lien and international businesses as well as improved persistency in the domestic first lien business. The Form 10 K 2006 AIG 35 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued expense ratio remained flat as premium growth covered increased expenses related to expansion internationally and continued investment in risk management resources. UGC had approximately $27 billion of guaranty risk in force at December 31, 2006. 2005 and 2004 Comparison UGCs net premiums written were up slightly for 2005 compared to 2004 as strong growth in the international and domestic second lien businesses was mostly offset by lower persistency in domestic first lien residential renewal premiums. Statutory underwriting profit rose from 2004 due to lower contract underwriting expenses and favorable loss development. Foreign General Insurance Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison Foreign Generals operating income increased $661 million or 27 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to out of period adjustments related to the accounting for interests in unit investment trusts, the absence of significant catastrophe related losses in 2006, rate increases and lower current accident year losses by the Lloyds syndicate Ascot (Ascot) on its U.S. book of business and lower asbestos and environmental reserve increases. Partially offsetting these increases in operating income were lower favorable loss development from prior accident years and adverse loss development on the 2005 hurricanes. Statutory underwriting profit increased $152 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Catastrophes in 2005 resulted in losses of $293 million and reinstatement premiums of $94 million. Net premiums written increased $1.4 billion or 14 percent (15 percent in original currency) in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer lines driven by new business from both established and new distribution channels, including a wholly owned insurance company in Vietnam and Central Insurance Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. Ascot also contributed to the growth in net premiums written as a result of rate increases on its U.S. business. Consumer lines in Latin America and commercial lines in Europe, including the U.K., also contributed to the increase. Net premiums written for 2005 were reduced by reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes and a portfolio transfer of unearned premium reserves to DBG related to the Richmond commutation, accounting for 3 percent of the increase in 2006 compared to 2005. The 2006 combined ratio declined to 83.7, a decrease of 1.9 points from 2005. The 2005 catastrophes added 3.5 points to the 2005 loss ratio. The expense ratio in 2006 increased by 1.3 points as a result of increased amortization of deferred advertising costs and a continued change in the business mix towards products with higher acquisition costs but historically lower loss ratios. The loss ratio decreased 3.2 points in 2006 as the absence of significant catastrophes in 2006 resulted in a decrease of 3.5 points, rate increases and lower current year losses by Ascot on its U.S. book of business accounted for 1.3 points of the decrease and lower asbestos and environmental reserve increases accounted for 1.2 points of the decrease. These declines were partially offset by lower favorable loss development from prior accident years and adverse development on 2005 hurricanes. The expense ratio increased 1.3 points in 2006 compared to 2005. Underwriting expenses for 2006 increased $59 million due to an out of period adjustment for amortization of deferred advertising costs and premiums were reduced by $61 million due to reconciliation remediation activities, in aggregate accounting for 0.7 points of the increase in the expense ratio. The expense ratio also increased due to growth in consumer business lines, which have higher acquisition expenses but historically lower loss ratios. The expense ratio for 2005 increased by 1.2 points due to the decline in net premiums written from reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes and the portfolio transfer of the Richmond unearned premium reserves. Due to the current mix of business, AIG expects the expense ratio to continue to increase during 2007, principally for classes of business with historically lower than average loss ratios. Net investment income increased $540 million or 57 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a $424 million out of period adjustment related to the accounting for interests in unit investment trusts. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Foreign General operating income increased 81 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to favorable loss development from prior accident years and increased net investment income. Net premiums written increased 6 percent (4 percent in original currency) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of new business as well as new distribution channels such as the February 2005 purchase of the insurance portfolio of the Royal & Sun Alliance branch operations in Japan. The personal accident business in the Far East and the personal lines operations in Latin America also contributed to the growth. Partially offsetting these increases was the portfolio transfer of Richmonds unearned premium reserves to DBG, which reduced net premiums in 2005 and reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes. The 2005 combined ratio of 85.6 decreased 5.3 points from 2004. The loss ratio decreased 8.0 points in 2005 from 2004. The loss ratio decreased 4.7 points due to favorable loss development from prior accident years, excluding catastrophes, and 2.3 points related to a 2004 loss reserve restatement adjustment. The loss ratio increased 0.9 points due to higher catastrophe losses in 2005 related to hurricanes. The expense ratio increased 2.7 points in 2005 from 2004 principally due to the portfolio transfer of Richmonds unearned premium reserves to DBG in 2005, loyalty business initiatives in the consumer business lines, which have higher acquisition costs, and also due to reinstatement premiums. Foreign General net investment income increased $326 million in 2005 compared to 2004 on increased partnership income, reflecting increases in market valuations of infrastructure fund investments in Africa, Asia, China, Eastern Europe and India. Additionally, net investment income was positively affected by positive cash flows, higher interest rates and the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. Cash flow was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 due to payments for 36 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries catastrophe related losses incurred in 2005 and 2004 and for the purchase of the Royal & Sun Alliance branch operations. Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses The following table presents the components of the General Insurance gross reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 by major lines of business on a statutory Annual Statement basis*: (in millions) 2006 2005 Other liability occurrence $ 19,156 $ 18,116 Workers compensation 13,465 11,630 Other liability claims made 12,394 12,447 Property 6,663 7,217 Auto liability 5,931 6,569 International 5,810 4,939 Reinsurance 2,960 2,886 Medical malpractice 2,308 2,363 Products liability 2,168 1,937 Accident and health 1,649 1,678 Commercial multiple peril 1,621 1,359 Aircraft 1,562 1,844 Fidelity/surety 1,127 1,072 Other 3,185 3,112 Total $ 79,999 $ 77,169 * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). AIGs gross reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. At December 31, 2006, General Insurance net loss reserves increased $5.15 billion from 2005 to $62.63 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income. The following table classifies the components of the General Insurance net loss reserves by business unit as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. (in millions) 2006 2005 DBG(a) $ 43,998 $ 40,782 Transatlantic 6,207 5,690 Personal Lines(b) 2,440 2,578 Mortgage Guaranty 460 340 Foreign General(c) 9,525 8,086 Total Net Loss Reserve $ 62,630 $ 57,476 (a) At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, DBG loss reserves include approximately $3.33 billion and $3.77 billion ($3.66 billion and $4.26 billion, respectively, before discount), related to business written by DBG but ceded to AIRCO and reported in AIRCOs statutory filings. DBG loss reserves also include approximately $535 million and $407 million related to business included in AIUOs statutory filings at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (b) At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, Personal Lines loss reserves include $861 million and $878 million related to business ceded to DBG and reported in DBGs statutory filings. (c) At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, Foreign General loss reserves include approximately $2.87 billion and $2.15 billion related to business reported in DBGs statutory filings. The DBG net loss reserve of $44.0 billion is comprised principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and the surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability Insurance Company and Landmark Insurance Company). Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was 40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999, 75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and 2003, 40 percent in 2004, 35 percent in 2005 and 20 percent in 2006 and covered all business written in these years for these lines by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool. In 1998 the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence business, but in 1999 and subsequent years included products liability occurrence. AIRCOs loss reserves relating to these quota share cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of year end 2006, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately $330 million applicable to the $3.66 billion in undiscounted reserves it assumed from the American Home/ National Union pool via this quota share cession. AIRCO also carries approximately $467 million in net loss reserves relating to Foreign General insurance business. These reserves are carried on an undiscounted basis. Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a percentage of all business written by the companies participating in the personal lines pool to the American Home/ National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves carried by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool relating to this cession amounted to $861 million as of year end 2006. The companies participating in the American Home/ National Union pool have maintained a participation in the business written by AIU for decades. As of year end 2006, these AIU reserves carried by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool amounted to approximately $2.87 billion. The remaining Foreign Form 10 K 2006 AIG 37 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other smaller AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States. Statutory filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and therefore exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves carried at year end 2006 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately $4.57 billion and $3.80 billion, respectively. AIRCOs $3.80 billion in total general insurance reserves consists of approximately $3.33 billion from business assumed from the American Home/ National Union pool and an additional $467 million relating to Foreign General Insurance business. Discounting of Reserves At December 31, 2006, AIGs overall General Insurance net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.26 billion, including tabular and non tabular calculations. The tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the companys own payout pattern, with the future expected payment for each year using the interest rate associated with the corresponding Treasury security yield for that time period. The discount is comprised of the following: $662 million tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; $1.27 billion non tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; and, $330 million non tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO. The total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by DBG is approximately $11.5 billion as of year end 2006. The other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in AIRCO that is assumed from DBG is discounted based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the DBG payout pattern for this business. The undiscounted reserves assumed by AIRCO from DBG totaled approximately $3.66 billion at December 31, 2006. Results of 2006 Reserving Process Management believes that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as of December 31, 2006. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2006. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

AIGs year end 2005 reserve review reflected careful consideration of the reserve analyses prepared by AIGs internal actuarial staff with the assistance of third party actuaries. In determining the appropriate loss ratios for accident year 2006 for each class of business, AIG gave consideration to the loss ratios resulting from the 2005 reserve analyses as well as all other relevant information including rate changes, expected changes in loss costs, changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and other factors that may affect the loss ratios. In 2006, AIG enhanced its process of determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years. In the first quarter of 2006, AIG began conducting additional analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center. For example, if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries now take additional steps to examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center, as appropriate, in the first, second and third quarters of 2006 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the first, second and third quarters of 2006. As part of its quarterly reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to stock option backdating. In the fourth quarter of 2006, a comprehensive loss reserve review was completed for each AIG general insurance subsidiary. The prior accident year loss reserve development shown in the tables above for 2006 reflects the results of these comprehensive reviews, including the effect of actual loss emergence in the fourth quarter of 2006. In 2006, net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately $53 million, including approximately $198 million in net adverse development from asbestos and environmental reserves resulting from the updated ground up analysis of these exposures in the fourth quarter of 2006; approximately $103 million of adverse development pertaining to the major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005; and $181 million of adverse development from the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic; and excluding approximately $300 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. Excluding the fourth quarter asbestos and environmental reserve increase, catastrophes and Transatlantic, as well as accretion of discount, net loss development in 2006 from prior accident years was favorable by approximately $535 million. The overall favorable development of $53 million consisted of approximately $2.30 billion of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2005, partially offset by approximately $2.25 billion of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior. For 2006, most classes of AIGs business continued to experience favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2005. The adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior reflected development from excess casualty, workers compensation, excess workers compensation, and post 1986 environmental liability classes of business, all within DBG, from asbestos reserves within DBG and Foreign General, and from Transatlantic. For 2005, net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately $4.68 billion, including approximately $269 million from the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic. This $4.68 billion adverse development in 2005 was comprised of approximately $8.60 billion for the 2002 and prior accident years, partially offset by favorable development for accident years 2003 and 2004 for most classes of business, with the notable exception of D&O. The adverse loss development for 2002 and prior accident years was attributable to approximately $4.0 billion of development from the D&O and related management liability classes of business, excess casualty, and excess workers compensation, and to approximately $900 million of adverse development from asbestos and environmental claims. The remaining portion of the adverse development from 2002 and Form 10 K 2006 AIG 39 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued prior accident years included approximately $520 million related to Transatlantic with the balance spread across many other classes of business. Most classes of business produced favorable development for accident years 2003 and 2004, and adverse development for accident years 2001 and prior. For 2004, AIGs overall net loss reserve development from prior accident years was an increase of approximately $3.19 billion, including approximately $317 million from the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic and excluding approximately $377 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. This $3.19 billion adverse development in 2004 was comprised of approximately $4.67 billion of adverse development for the 2002 and prior accident years, partially offset by approximately $1.48 billion of favorable development for accident year 2003. The adverse development for the 2002 and prior accident years was primarily attributable to excess casualty, D&O and related management liability classes, and asbestos and environmental reserves, all within DBG, and also to Transatlantic. Most classes of business throughout AIG produced favorable development for accident year 2003. The following is a discussion of the primary reasons for the development in 2006, 2005 and 2004 for those classes of business that experienced significant prior accident year developments during the three year period. See Asbestos and Environmental Reserves below for a further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves and developments. Excess Casualty: Excess Casualty reserves experienced significant adverse loss development in 2004 and 2005, but in 2006 there was only a relatively minor amount of adverse development. The adverse development for all periods shown related principally to accident years 2000 and prior, and to a lesser extent 2001, and resulted from significant loss cost increases due to both frequency and severity of claims. The increase in loss costs resulted primarily from medical inflation, which increased the economic loss component of tort claims, advances in medical care, which extended the life span of severely injured claimants, and larger jury verdicts, which increased the value of severe tort claims. An additional factor affecting AIGs excess casualty experience in recent years has been the accelerated exhaustion of underlying primary policies for homebuilders. This has led to increased construction defect related claims activity on AIGs excess policies. Many excess casualty policies were written on a multi year basis in the late 1990s, which limited AIGs ability to respond to emerging market trends as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. In subsequent years, AIG responded to these emerging trends by increasing rates and implementing numerous policy form and coverage changes. This led to a significant improvement in experience beginning with accident year 2001. In the year end 2004 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries responded to the adverse development for excess casualty by increasing the loss development factor assumptions. In the year end 2004 reserve study, the development factors applicable to accident years 1998 and subsequent were increased by approximately 12 percent. In addition, the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 and subsequent were increased to take into account the higher ultimate loss ratios for accident years 2001 and prior. For the year end 2005 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries responded to the continuing adverse development by further increasing the loss development factors applicable to accident years 1999 and subsequent by approximately 5 percent. In addition, to more accurately estimate losses for construction defect related claims, a separate review was performed by AIG claims staff for accounts with significant exposure to these claims. For the year end 2006 loss reserve review, AIG claims staff updated the separate review for accounts with significant exposure to construction defect related claims in order to assist the actuaries in determining the proper reserve for this exposure. AIGs actuaries determined that no significant changes in the assumptions were required. Prior accident year loss development in 2006 was adverse by approximately $100 million, a relatively minor amount for this class of business. However, AIG continues to experience adverse development for this class for accident years prior to 2003. Loss reserves pertaining to the excess casualty class of business are generally included in the Other liability occurrence line of business, with a small portion of the excess casualty reserves included in the Other liability claims made line of business, as presented in the table on page 37. D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business: These classes of business experienced significant adverse development in 2004 and 2005, but experienced slightly favorable development in 2006. The adverse development in 2004 and 2005 related principally to accident years 2002 and prior. This adverse development resulted from significant loss cost escalation due to a variety of factors, including the following: the increase in frequency and severity of corporate bankruptcies; the increase in frequency of financial statement restatements; the sharp rise in market capitalization of publicly traded companies; and the increase in the number of initial public offerings, which led to an unprecedented number of IPO allocation/laddering suits in 2001. In addition, extensive utilization of multi year policies during this period limited AIGs ability to respond to emerging trends as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. AIG experienced significant adverse loss development since 2002 as a result of these issues. AIG responded to this development with rate increases and policy form and coverage changes to better contain future loss costs in this class of business. In the year end 2004 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries responded to the adverse development for D&O and related management liability classes by increasing the loss development factor assumptions. The development factors applicable to accident years 1997 and subsequent were increased by approximately 5 percent in the year end 2004 reserve study. In addition, the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 and subsequent were increased to take into account the higher ultimate loss ratios for accident years 2001 and prior. The loss ratios for the older accident years increased due to the combination of higher than expected loss development in the year and the increase in the loss development factor assumptions. 40 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries For the year end 2005 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries responded to the continuing adverse development by further increasing the loss development factor assumptions. The loss development factors applicable to 1997 and subsequent accident years were increased by approximately 4 percent. In addition, AIGs actuaries began to give greater weight to loss development methods for accident years 2002 and 2003, in order to more fully respond to the recent loss experience. AIGs claims staff also conducted a series of ground up claim projections covering all open claims for this business through accident year 2004. AIGs actuaries benchmarked the loss reserve indications for all accident years through 2004 to these claim projections. For the year end 2006 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries determined that no significant changes in the assumptions were required. Prior accident year loss development in 2006 was favorable by approximately $20 million, an insignificant amount for these classes. AIGs actuaries continued to benchmark the loss reserve indications to the ground up claim projections provided by AIG claims staff for this class of business. For the year end 2006 loss reserve review, the ground up claim projections included all accident years through 2005. Loss reserves pertaining to D&O and related management liability classes of business are included in the Other liability claims made line of business, as presented in the table on page 37. Excess Workers Compensation: This class of business experienced significant adverse development in 2005, and a relatively minor amount of adverse development in 2006. The adverse development in 2005 related to 2002 and prior accident years. This adverse development resulted primarily from significant loss cost increases, primarily attributable to rapidly increasing medical inflation and advances in medical care, which increased the cost of covered medical care and extended the life span of severely injured workers. The effect of these factors on excess workers compensation claims experience is leveraged, as frequency is increased by the rising number of claims that reach the excess layers. In response to the significantly adverse loss development in 2005, an additional study was conducted for the 2005 year end actuarial reserve analysis for DBG pertaining to the selection of loss development factors for this class of business. Claims for excess workers compensation exhibit an exceptionally long tail of loss development, running for decades from the date the loss is incurred. Thus, the adequacy of loss reserves for this class is sensitive to the estimated loss development factors, as such factors may be applied to many years of loss experience. In order to better estimate the tail development for this class, AIG claims staff conducted a claim by claim projection of the expected ultimate paid loss for each open claim for 1998 and prior accident years as these are the primary years from which the tail factors are derived. The objective of the study was to provide a benchmark against which loss development factors in the tail could be evaluated. The resulting loss development factors utilized by the actuaries in the year end 2005 study reflected an increase of approximately 18 percent from the factors used in the prior year study without the benefit of the claims benchmark. In addition, the loss cost trend assumption for excess workers compensation was increased from approximately 2.5 percent to 6 percent for the 2005 study. For the year end 2006 loss reserve review, AIG claims staff updated the claim by claim projection for each open claim for accident years 1999 and prior. These updated claims projections were utilized by the actuaries as a benchmark for loss development factors in the year end 2006 study. AIGs actuaries determined that no significant changes in the assumptions were required. Prior accident year development in 2006 was adverse by approximately $70 million, a relatively minor amount for this class. Overview of Loss Reserving Process The General Insurance loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. One group is short tail classes of business consisting principally of property, personal lines and certain casualty classes. The other group is long tail casualty classes of business which includes excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability, and related classes. Short Tail Reserves For operations writing short tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserves is generally geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums, and this level of reserve would generally be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor would be adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. Long Tail Reserves Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty classes of business shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller percentage would be net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses. AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty classes of businesses. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty classes of business, net loss trend factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items Form 10 K 2006 AIG 41 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms, current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. A number of actuarial assumptions are generally made in the review of reserves for each class of business. For longer tail classes of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following: Loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2006 for the year end 2006 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many General Insurance classes of business. The overall change in AIGs loss reserves is based on the sum of these classes of business changes. For most long tail classes of business, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the current accident quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. Also any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. Details of the Loss Reserving Process The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; and actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business reflects input from actuarial, underwriting and claims staff and is intended to represent managements best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the factors described above. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is completed in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG general insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each class of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the appropriateness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and therefore of AIGs overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews a point estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these point estimates for each class of business for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers both the actuarial point estimate and numerous other internal and external factors including a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling. Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements. Actuarial Methods for Major Classes of Business In testing the reserves for each class of business, a determination is made by AIGs actuaries as to the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as frequency or severity. Other factors considered include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, AIG writes a great number of unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for professional liability, it is appropriate to combine the subclasses 42 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries into larger groups. The greater degree of credibility in the claims experience of the larger groups may outweigh the greater degree of homogeneity of the individual subclasses. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most accurate estimate of the loss reserves. Actuarial methods used by AIG for most long tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods, including Bornhuetter Ferguson methods described below. Other methods considered include frequency/severity methods, although these are generally used by AIG more for pricing analysis than for loss reserve analysis. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. Expected loss ratio methods are generally utilized by AIG where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long tail classes at early stages of loss development. Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss expense would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. Bornhuetter Ferguson methods are expected loss ratio methods for which the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses. A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged for the expected loss ratio to be modified to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if in fact the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of properly recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year. AIGs loss reserve reviews for long tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required in order to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next. Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the Form 10 K 2006 AIG 43 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto. AIG utilizes these methods in pricing subclasses of professional liability. However, AIG does not generally utilize frequency/severity methods to test loss reserves, due to the general nature of AIGs reserves being applicable to lower frequency, higher severity commercial classes of business where average claim severity is volatile. Excess Casualty: AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess casualty classes. Expected loss ratio methods are generally utilized for at least the three latest accident years, due to the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss experience is generally reviewed separately for lead umbrella classes and for other excess classes, due to the relatively shorter tail for lead umbrella business. Automobile related claims are generally reviewed separately from non auto claims, due to the shorter tail nature of the automobile related claims. The expected loss ratios utilized for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios of prior years, adjusted for rate changes, estimated loss cost trends and all other changes that can be quantified. The estimated loss cost trend utilized in the year end 2006 reviews averaged approximately 6 percent for excess casualty classes. Frequency/severity methods are generally not utilized as the vast majority of reported claims do not result in a claim payment. In addition, the average severity varies significantly from accident year to accident year due to large losses which characterize this class of business, as well as changing proportions of claims which do not result in a claim payment. D&O: AIG generally utilizes a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for D&O and related management liability classes of business. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight in the two most recent accident years, whereas loss development methods are given more weight in more mature accident years. Beginning with the year end 2005 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries began to utilize claim projections provided by AIG claims staff as a benchmark for determining the indicated ultimate losses for accident years 2004 and prior. For the year end 2006 loss reserve review, claims projections for accident years 2005 and prior were utilized. In prior years, AIGs actuaries had utilized these claims projections as a benchmark for profitability studies for major classes of D&O and related management liability business. The track record of these claims projections has indicated a very low margin of error, thus providing support for their usage as a benchmark in determining the estimated loss reserve. These classes of business reflect claims made coverage, and losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity. Thus, the claim projections can produce an accurate overall indicator of the ultimate loss exposure for these classes by identifying and estimating all large losses. Frequency/severity methods are generally not utilized for these classes as the overall losses are driven by large losses more than by claim frequency. Severity trends have varied significantly from accident year to accident year. Workers Compensation: AIG generally utilizes loss development methods for all but the most recent accident year. Expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers compensation claims are generally characterized by high frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next. AIG is a leading writer of workers compensation, and thus has sufficient volume of claims experience to utilize development methods. AIG does not believe frequency/severity methods are as appropriate, due to significant growth and changes in AIGs workers compensation business over the years. AIG generally segregates California business from other business in evaluating workers compensation reserves. Certain classes of workers compensation, such as construction, are also evaluated separately. Additionally, AIG writes a number of very large accounts which include workers compensation coverage. These accounts are generally priced by AIG actuaries, and to the extent appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis may be utilized to record the initial estimated loss reserves for these accounts. Excess Workers Compensation: AIG generally utilizes a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods. Loss development methods are given the greater weight for mature accident years such as 2000 and prior. Expected loss ratio methods are given the greater weight for the more recent accident years. Excess workers compensation is an extremely long tail class of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. Therefore there is limited credibility in the reported losses for many of the more recent accident years. Beginning with the year end 2005 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries began to utilize claims projections provided by AIG claims staff to help determine the loss development factors for this class of business. General Liability: AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for primary general liability or products liability classes. For certain classes of business with sufficient loss volume, loss development methods may be given significant weight for all but the most recent one or two accident years, whereas for smaller or more volatile classes of business, loss development methods may be given limited weight for the five or more most recent accident years. Expected loss ratio methods would be utilized for the more recent accident years for these classes. The loss experience for primary general liability business is generally reviewed at a level that is believed to provide the most appropriate data for reserve analysis. For example, primary claims made business is generally segregated from business written on an occurrence policy form. Additionally, certain subclasses, such as construction, are generally reviewed separately from business in other subclasses. Due to the fairly long tail nature of general liability business, and the many subclasses that are reviewed individually, there is less credibility in the reported losses and increased reliance on expected loss ratio methods. AIGs actuaries generally do not 44 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries utilize frequency/severity methods to test reserves for this business, due to significant changes and growth in AIGs general liability and products liability business over the years. Commercial Automobile Liability: AIG generally utilizes loss development methods for all but the most recent accident year for commercial automobile classes of business. Expected loss ratio methods are generally given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Frequency/severity methods are generally not utilized due to significant changes and growth in this business over the years. Healthcare: AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for healthcare classes of business. The largest component of the healthcare business consists of coverage written for hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Reserves for excess coverage are tested separately from those for primary coverage. For primary coverages, loss development methods are generally given the majority of the weight for all but the latest three accident years, and are given some weight for all years other than the latest accident year. For excess coverages, expected loss methods are generally given all the weight for the latest three accident years, and are also given considerable weight for accident years prior to the latest three years. For other classes of healthcare coverage, an analogous weighting between loss development and expected loss ratio methods is utilized. The weights assigned to each method are those which are believed to result in the best combination of responsiveness and stability. Frequency/severity methods are sometimes utilized for pricing certain healthcare accounts or business. However, in testing loss reserves the business is generally combined into larger groupings to enhance the credibility of the loss experience. The frequency/severity methods that are applicable in pricing may not be appropriate for reserve testing and thus frequency/severity methods are not generally employed in AIGs healthcare reserve analyses. Professional Liability: AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for professional liability classes of business. Loss development methods are used for the more mature accident years. Greater weight is given to expected loss ratio methods in the more recent accident years. Reserves are tested separately for claims made classes and classes written on occurrence policy forms. Further segmentations are made in a manner believed to provide the most appropriate balance between credibility and homogeneity of the data. Frequency/severity methods are used in pricing and profitability analyses for some classes of professional liability; however, for loss reserve testing, the need to enhance credibility generally results in classes that are not sufficiently homogenous to utilize frequency/severity methods. Aviation: AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods are used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Expected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year. Personal Auto (Domestic): AIG generally utilizes frequency/severity methods and loss development methods for domestic personal auto classes. For many classes of business, greater reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto and allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Fidelity/Surety: AIG generally uses loss development methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident year. Expected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the more recent accident years, and for the latest accident year they may be given 100 percent weight. For surety exposures, AIG generally uses the same method as for short tail classes. Mortgage Guaranty: AIG tests mortgage guaranty reserves using loss development methods, supplemented by an internal claim analysis by actuaries and staff who specialize in the mortgage guaranty business. The claim analysis projects ultimate losses for claims within each of several categories of default based on actual historical experience and is essentially a frequency/severity analysis for each category of default. Short Tail Classes: AIG generally uses either loss development methods or IBNR factor methods to set reserves for short tail classes such as property coverages. Where a factor is used, it generally represents a percent of earned premium or other exposure measure. The factor is determined based on prior accident year experience. For example, the IBNR for a class of property coverage might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premium. The factor is continually reevaluated in light of emerging claim experience as well as rate changes or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed. International: Business written by AIGs Foreign General Insurance sub segment includes both long tail and short tail classes of business. For long tail classes of business, the actuarial methods utilized would be analogous to those described above. However, the majority of business written by Foreign General Insurance is short tail, high frequency and low severity in nature. For this business, loss development methods are generally employed to test the loss reserves. AIG maintains a data base of detailed historical premium and loss transactions in original currency for business written by Foreign General Insurance, thereby allowing AIG actuaries to determine the current reserves without any distortion from changes in exchange rates over time. In testing the Foreign General Insurance reserves, AIGs actuaries segment the data by region, country or class of business as appropriate to determine the optimal balance between homogeneity and credibility. Loss Adjustment Expenses: AIG determines reserves for legal defense and cost containment loss adjustment expenses for each Form 10 K 2006 AIG 45 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued class of business by one or more actuarial methods. The methods generally include development methods analogous to those described for loss development methods. The developments could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar classes of business. AIG generally determines reserves for adjuster loss adjustment expenses based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular class of business. AIG generally determines reserves for other unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on the ratio of the calendar year expenses paid to overall losses paid. This determination is generally done for all classes of business combined, and reflects costs of home office claim overhead as a percent of losses paid. Catastrophes: Special analyses are conducted by AIG in response to major catastrophes in order to estimate AIGs gross and net loss and loss expense liability from the event. These analyses may include a combination of approaches, including modeling estimates, ground up claim analysis, loss evaluation reports from on site field adjusters, and market share estimates. AIGs loss reserve analyses do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss reserves from AIGs General Insurance business relates to longer tail casualty classes of business driven by severity rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. Using the reserving methodologies described above, AIGs actuaries determine their best estimate of the required reserve and advise Management of that amount. AIG then adjusts its aggregate carried reserves as necessary so that the actual carried reserves as of December 31 reflect this best estimate. Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity Analyses As described above, AIG uses numerous assumptions in determining its best estimate of reserves for each class of business. The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both class of business and accident year. If actual experience differs from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, D&O or workers compensation. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on the loss reserve position of using alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions rather than those actually used in determining AIGs best estimates in the year end loss reserve analyses for 2006. The analysis addresses each major class of business for which a material deviation to AIGs overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible, and uses what AIG believes is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each class. There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve development will be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, or that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business. Excess Casualty: For the excess casualty class of business, the assumed loss cost trend was approximately six percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2006 loss reserve review for excess casualty will range from negative four percent to positive 16 percent, or approximately ten percent lower or higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year end 2006 reserve review. A ten percent change in the assumed loss cost trend for excess casualty would cause approximately a $1.7 billion increase or a $1.2 billion decrease in the net loss and loss expense reserve for this class of business. It should be emphasized that the ten percent deviations are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by AIG to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years, including amounts below the negative four percent cited above, whereas actual loss cost trends in the late 1990s ran well into the double digits for several years, including amounts greater than the 16 percent cited above. Thus, there can be no assurance that loss trends will not deviate by more than ten percent. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the excess casualty class of business due the long tail nature of the claims and therefore is applied across many accident years. For the excess casualty class of business, the assumed loss development factors are also a key assumption. After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 3.25 percent below those actually utilized in the year end 2006 reserve review to approximately ten percent above those factors actually utilized. If the loss development factor assumptions were changed by 3.25 percent and ten percent, respectively, the net loss reserves for the excess casualty class would decrease by approximately $450 million under the lower assumptions or increase by approximately $1.25 billion under the higher assumptions. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate by more than the amounts illustrated above. Moreover, as excess casualty is a long tail class of business, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims. Thus, there is the potential for 46 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries variations greater than the amounts cited above, either positively or negatively. D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business: For D&O and related management liability classes of business, the assumed loss cost trend was approximately four percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2006 loss reserve review for these classes will range from negative 11 percent to positive 19 percent, or approximately 15 percent lower or higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year end 2006 reserve review. A 15 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend for these classes would cause approximately a $625 million increase or a $550 million decrease in the net loss and loss expense reserves for these classes of business. It should be emphasized that the 15 percent deviations are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by AIG to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. Actual loss cost trends for these classes in the early 1990s were negative for several years, including amounts below the negative 11 percent cited above, whereas actual loss cost trends in the late 1990s ran at nearly 50 percent per year for several years, vastly exceeding the 19 percent figure cited above. Because the D&O class of business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. For D&O and related management liability classes of business, the assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption but less critical than for excess casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for excess casualty. However, the high severity nature of the claims does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for these classes of business for accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range approximately five percent lower or higher than those factors actually utilized in the year end 2006 loss reserve review for these classes. If the loss development factor assumptions were changed by five percent, the net loss reserves for these classes would be estimated to increase or decrease by approximately $200 million. As noted above for excess casualty, actual historical loss development factors are generally used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate by more than the five percent. Excess Workers Compensation: For excess workers compensation business, loss costs were trended at six percent per annum. After reviewing actual industry loss trends for the past ten years, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2006 loss reserve review for excess workers compensation will range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. A five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $350 million increase or a $225 million decrease in the net loss reserves for this business. It should be emphasized that the actual loss cost trend could vary significantly from this assumption, and there can be no assurance that actual loss costs will not deviate, perhaps materially, by greater than five percent. For excess workers compensation business, the assumed loss development factors are a critical assumption. Excess workers compensation is an extremely long tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range approximately 15 percent lower or higher than those factors actually utilized in the year end 2006 loss reserve review for excess workers compensation. If the loss development factor assumptions were changed by 15 percent, the net loss reserves for excess workers compensation would increase or decrease by approximately $600 million. Given the exceptionally long tail for this class of business, there is the potential for actual deviations in the loss development tail to exceed the deviations assumed, perhaps materially. Primary Workers Compensation: For primary workers compensation, the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to AIGs loss reserves. This is primarily because AIGs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers compensation business. However, for primary workers compensation business the loss development factor assumptions are important. Generally, AIGs actual historical workers compensation loss development factors would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. However, workers compensation is a long tail class of business, and AIGs business reflects a very significant volume of losses particularly in recent accident years due to growth of the business. After evaluating the actual historical loss developments since the 1980s for this business, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will fall within the range of approximately 2.75 percent below to 7.5 percent above those actually utilized in the year end 2006 loss reserve review. If the loss development factor assumptions were changed by 2.75 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, the net loss reserves for workers compensation would decrease or increase by approximately $525 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. It should be noted that loss emergence in 2006 for this class was higher than historical averages, resulting in an increase in loss reserves for prior accident years. However, it is too soon to ascertain if this increased emergence represents a new trend in the pattern of loss development. For this class of business, there can be no assurance that actual deviations from the expected loss development factors will not exceed the deviations assumed, perhaps materially. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 47 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Other Casualty Classes of Business: For casualty business other than the classes discussed above, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor assumptions. However, the effect of such deviations is expected to be less material when compared to the effect on the classes cited above. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. The current environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the analysis herein. The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case by case basis. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse effect on AIGs future results of operations. With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a claim by claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally evaluates exposure on a policy by policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information. In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG attempts to mitigate its known long tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIGs specialized claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus, while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims involving accounts with products containing asbestos (Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution process, and parties with remote, ill defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four). Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the extent possible its exposure to these claims. To determine the appropriate loss reserve as of December 31, 2006 for its asbestos and environmental exposures, AIG performed a series of top down and ground up reserve analyses. In order to ensure it had the most comprehensive analysis possible, AIG engaged a third party actuary to assist in a review of these exposures, including ground up estimates for both asbestos reserves and environmental reserves consistent with the 2005 review. Prior to 2005, AIGs reserve analyses for asbestos and environmental exposures was focused around a report year projection of aggregate losses for both asbestos and environmental reserves. Additional tests such as market share analyses were also performed. Ground up analyses take into account policy 48 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries holder specific and claim specific information that has been gathered over many years from a variety of sources. Ground up studies can thus more accurately assess the exposure to AIGs layers of coverage for each policyholder, and hence for all policyholders in the aggregate, provided a sufficient sample of the policyholders can be modeled in this manner. In order to ensure its ground up analyses were comprehensive, AIG staff produced in the 2006 analyses the information required at policy and claim level detail for over 1,000 asbestos defendants and nearly 1,000 environmental defendants. This represented over 95 percent of all accounts for which AIG had received any claim notice of any amount pertaining to asbestos or environmental exposure. AIG did not set any minimum thresholds, such as amount of case reserve outstanding, or paid losses to date, that would have served to reduce the sample size and hence the comprehensiveness of the ground up analysis. The results of the ground up analysis for each significant account were examined by AIGs claims staff for reasonableness, for consistency with policy coverage terms, and any claim settlement terms applicable. Adjustments were incorporated accordingly. The results from the universe of modeled accounts, which as noted above reflects the vast majority of AIGs known exposures, were then utilized to estimate the ultimate losses from accounts or exposures that could not be modeled and to determine the appropriate provision for all unreported claims. AIG conducted a comprehensive analysis of reinsurance recoverability to establish the appropriate asbestos and environmental reserve net of reinsurance. AIG determined the amount of reinsurance that would be ceded to insolvent reinsurers or to commuted reinsurance contracts for both reported claims and for IBNR. These amounts were then deducted from the indicated amount of reinsurance recoverable. The year end 2006 analysis reflected an update to the comprehensive analysis of reinsurance recoverability that was first completed in 2005. All asbestos accounts for which there was a significant change in estimated losses in the 2006 review were analyzed to determine the appropriate reserve net of reinsurance. AIG also completed a top down report year projection of its indicated asbestos and environmental loss reserves. These projections consist of a series of tests performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures. For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be reported over the next twenty years, i.e., from 2007 through 2026, based on the actual losses reported through 2006 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios were tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all carried asbestos case reserves are assumed to be within ten percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year development for asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2006. The third scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for asbestos but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2006. Based on the results of the prior report years for each of the three scenarios described above, the report year approach then projects forward to the year 2026 the expected future report year losses, based on AIGs estimate of reasonable loss trend assumptions. These calculations are performed on losses gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to gross losses for future loss emergence. For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/ severity tests are produced. Environmental claims from future report years, (i.e., IBNR) are projected out ten years, i.e., through the year 2016. At year end 2006, AIG considered a number of factors and recent experience in addition to the results of the respective top down and ground up analyses performed for asbestos and environmental reserves. AIG considered the significant uncertainty that remains as to AIGs ultimate liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims. This uncertainty is due to several factors including: The long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; The increase in the volume of claims by currently unimpaired plaintiffs; Claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies; The number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies; Diverging legal interpretations; and With respect to environmental claims, the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties. After carefully considering the results of the ground up analysis, which AIG updates on an annual basis, as well as all of the above factors, including the recent report year experience, AIG determined its best estimate was to recognize an increase of $256 million in its carried net asbestos reserves, and a decrease of $58 million in its carried net environmental reserves at December 31, 2006. The corresponding changes in gross reserves were an increase of approximately $570 million for asbestos and a decrease of approximately $230 million for environmental, respectively. A minor amount of additional incurred loss emergence pertaining to asbestos was reflected in 2006, primarily attributable to the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic. The majority of the increase in asbestos reserves resulting from the 2006 review is attributable to higher than expected emergence of claims pertaining to new asbestos policy exposures. A significant portion of this increase pertains to higher layers of excess coverage for certain major asbestos defendants on business written by DBG. Approximately $80 million of the overall $256 million net asbestos reserve increase is attributable to business written by Foreign General, approximately $30 million of which is in turn ceded to DBG. In 2006, Foreign General enhanced its capability to identify asbestos exposures, resulting in the identification of additional asbestos defendants in 2006, as well as higher layers of exposure for certain existing defendants. As described above, the ground up analysis as of 2006 now models over 1,000 asbestos defendants and over 95 percent of all known reported asbestos claims. The decrease in environmental reserves resulting from the 2006 review is primarily attributable to favorable loss trends in recent report years. These favorable trends resulted in a reduced expectation of unreported claims, i.e., IBNR, for future report years. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 49 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 appears in the table below. The vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years. The current environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the table below. 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 4,441 $ 1,840 $ 2,559 $ 1,060 $ 1,235 $ 386 Losses and loss expenses incurred(a) 571 267 2,207 (b) 903 (b) 1,595 (b) 772 (b) Losses and loss expenses paid(a) (548 ) (218 ) (325 ) (123 ) (271 ) (98 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 4,464 $ 1,889 $ 4,441 $ 1,840 $ 2,559 $ 1,060 Environmental: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 926 $ 410 $ 974 $ 451 $ 789 $ 283 Losses and loss expenses incurred(a) (232 ) (59 ) 47 (c) 27 (c) 314 (c) 234 (c) Losses and loss expenses paid(a) (106 ) (61 ) (95 ) (68 ) (129 ) (66 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 588 $ 290 $ 926 $ 410 $ 974 $ 451 Combined: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 5,367 $ 2,250 $ 3,533 $ 1,511 $ 2,024 $ 669 Losses and loss expenses incurred(a) 339 208 2,254 (d) 930 (d) 1,909 (d) 1,006 (d) Losses and loss expenses paid(a) (654 ) (279 ) (420 ) (191 ) (400 ) (164 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 5,052 $ 2,179 $ 5,367 $ 2,250 $ 3,533 $ 1,511 (a) All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years, primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior. (b) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $843 million and $650 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. (c) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $56 million and $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $30 million and $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. (d) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $873 million and $850 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. As indicated in the table above, asbestos loss payments increased significantly in 2006 compared to the prior years, primarily as a result of payments pertaining to settlements that had been negotiated in earlier periods. The gross and net IBNR included in the reserve for losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined, at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were estimated as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos $ 3,212 $ 1,469 $ 3,401 $ 1,465 $ 2,033 $ 876 Environmental 340 173 586 266 606 284 Combined $ 3,552 $ 1,642 $ 3,987 $ 1,731 $ 2,639 $ 1,160 A summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Claims at beginning of year 7,293 9,873 17,166 7,575 8,216 15,791 7,474 8,852 16,326 Claims during year: Opened 643 1,383 2,026 854 5,253 * 6,107 909 2,592 3,501 Settled (150 ) (155 ) (305 ) (67 ) (219 ) (286 ) (100 ) (279 ) (379 ) Dismissed or otherwise resolved (908 ) (1,659 ) (2,567 ) (1,069 ) (3,377 ) (4,446 ) (708 ) (2,949 ) (3,657 ) Claims at end of year 6,878 9,442 16,320 7,293 9,873 17,166 7,575 8,216 15,791 * The opened claims count increased substantially during 2005 compared to 2004 because a court ruling led AIG to report separate opened claims for previously pending cases relating to alleged MTBE exposures that AIG previously had counted in the aggregate as only a single claim on the assumption that the cases would be consolidated into a single federal court proceeding. 50 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Survival Ratios Asbestos and Environmental The following table presents AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for year end 2006, 2005 and 2004. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the year end carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The December 31, 2006 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at December 31, 2005 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio. AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Gross Net 2006 Survival ratios: Asbestos 11.7 12.9 Environmental 5.3 4.5 Combined 10.3 10.3 2005 Survival ratios: Asbestos 15.9 19.8 Environmental 6.9 6.2 Combined 13.0 14.2 2004 Survival ratios: Asbestos 10.7 13.5 Environmental 6.5 6.8 Combined 9.1 10.5 Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad.

The increased revenues reflect growth in the underlying global Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. Revenues include the positive effect of out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts totaling $240 million in 2006. Operating income grew by $1.1 billion from 2005, to $10.0 billion, reflecting higher revenues and out of period reductions of policy benefits expense of $163 million resulting from corrections of par policyholder dividend reserves and allocations between participating and non participating accounts, both of which were related to remediation efforts. Net investment income increased $1.3 billion, reflecting growth in the underlying global business and the related increased level of invested assets. Realized capital gains increased $246 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, operating income in 2006 includes charges of $125 million for the adverse Superior National arbitration ruling (see Note 12(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and $66 million related to the exiting of the domestic financial institutions credit life business. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Life Insurance & Retirement Services revenues, including realized capital losses of $158 million, grew $4.0 billion to $47.4 billion. The increase in revenues reflects growth in the underlying global Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. Operating income grew $979 million in 2005, reflecting growth in both domestic and overseas operations. In 2005, the Domestic Life Insurance reporting unit performed well in its life insurance and payout annuities businesses, but results were offset by restructuring efforts in both home services and group life/health. The Domestic Retirement Services reporting unit faced a challenging environment in 2005, resulting in lower deposits and increased surrender rates. The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services reporting unit had improved operating income in 2005 helped by higher net investment income, lower acquisition and operating expenses in life insurance and strong growth in annuities, partially offset by lower realized capital gains and higher incurred policy benefit costs. 52 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services results for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Net Realized GAAP Investment Capital Gains Total Operating (in millions) Premiums Income (Losses) Revenues Income 2006 Japan and Other: Life insurance(a) $ 4,769 $ 1,696 $ 316 $ 6,781 $ 1,725 Personal accident 3,957 162 49 4,168 1,122 Group products 1,740 541 13 2,294 272 Individual fixed annuities 337 1,930 28 2,295 553 Individual variable annuities 173 325 498 60 Total $ 10,976 $ 4,654 $ 406 $ 16,036 $ 3,732 Asia: Life insurance(b) $ 10,949 $ 4,188 $ 258 $ 15,395 $ 2,516 Personal accident 1,561 123 6 1,690 337 Group products 486 107 34 627 178 Individual fixed annuities 63 97 3 163 27 Individual variable annuities 1 4 5 2 Total $ 13,060 $ 4,519 $ 301 $ 17,880 $ 3,060 Total Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Life insurance(a)(b) $ 15,718 $ 5,884 $ 574 $ 22,176 $ 4,241 Personal accident 5,518 285 55 5,858 1,459 Group products 2,226 648 47 2,921 450 Individual fixed annuities 400 2,027 31 2,458 580 Individual variable annuities 174 329 503 62 Total $ 24,036 $ 9,173 $ 707 $ 33,916 $ 6,792 2005 Japan and Other: Life insurance $ 4,852 $ 1,752 $ (52 ) $ 6,552 $ 1,280 Personal accident 3,788 137 (15 ) 3,910 1,051 Group products 1,473 535 (34 ) 1,974 191 Individual fixed annuities 292 1,672 29 1,993 390 Individual variable annuities 97 767 864 47 Total $ 10,502 $ 4,863 $ (72 ) $ 15,293 $ 2,959 Asia: Life insurance $ 10,779 $ 3,056 $ 146 $ 13,981 $ 1,907 Personal accident 1,214 118 (15 ) 1,317 241 Group products 452 78 25 555 131 Individual fixed annuities 69 56 125 8 Individual variable annuities 4 4 (1 ) Total $ 12,514 $ 3,312 $ 156 $ 15,982 $ 2,286 Total Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Life insurance $ 15,631 $ 4,808 $ 94 $ 20,533 $ 3,187 Personal accident 5,002 255 (30 ) 5,227 1,292 Group products 1,925 613 (9 ) 2,529 322 Individual fixed annuities 361 1,728 29 2,118 398 Individual variable annuities 97 771 868 46 Total $ 23,016 $ 8,175 $ 84 $ 31,275 $ 5,245 Form 10 K 2006 AIG 53 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Net Realized GAAP Investment Capital Gains Total Operating (in millions) Premiums Income (Losses) Revenues Income 2004 Japan and Other: Life insurance $ 4,469 $ 1,371 $ (134 ) $ 5,706 $ 1,079 Personal accident 3,307 96 16 3,419 932 Group products 1,229 378 (42 ) 1,565 133 Individual fixed annuities 312 1,011 4 1,327 236 Individual variable annuities 68 142 210 13 Total $ 9,385 $ 2,998 $ (156 ) $ 12,227 $ 2,393 Asia: Life insurance $ 10,469 $ 2,676 $ 497 $ 13,642 $ 2,098 Personal accident 994 83 17 1,094 260 Group products(c) 986 53 14 1,053 90 Individual fixed annuities 83 23 106 7 Individual variable annuities 1 1 Total $ 12,532 $ 2,836 $ 528 $ 15,896 $ 2,455 Total Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Life insurance $ 14,938 $ 4,047 $ 363 $ 19,348 $ 3,177 Personal accident 4,301 179 33 4,513 1,192 Group products(c) 2,215 431 (28 ) 2,618 223 Individual fixed annuities 395 1,034 4 1,433 243 Individual variable annuities 68 143 211 13 Total $ 21,917 $ 5,834 $ 372 $ 28,123 $ 4,848 (a) Includes the effect of out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts. For 2006, the effect was an increase of $32 million in both net investment income and operating income. (b) Includes the effect of out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts. For 2006, the effect was an increase of $208 million and $137 million in net investment income and operating income, respectively. Operating income also includes an out of period reduction in participating policyholder dividend reserves of $163 million, primarily as a result of tax remediation adjustments. (c) Revenues include approximately $640 million of premiums from a single reinsurance transaction involving terminal funding business, which is offset by a similar increase of benefit reserves. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies and therefore premiums reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and from changes in foreign currency translation rates. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Growth in original currency* 6.4 % 2.5% Foreign exchange effect (2.0 ) 2.5 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 4.4 % 5.0% * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period. Japan and Other 2006 and 2005 Comparison Total revenues for Japan and Other increased $743 million in 2006, to $16.0 billion, compared to 2005. Operating income grew $773 million, due to growth in the underlying retirement services businesses and realized capital gains of $406 million. The 2006 results for the reporting unit were negatively affected by the weakening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar during 2006. In addition, operating income was negatively affected by the continued runoff of the older, higher margin in force business of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life. Life insurance GAAP premiums declined in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange negatively affected GAAP premiums by approximately $250 million, most notably as a result of the weakening in the Japanese Yen. Life insurance operating income grew $445 million, primarily due to an increase of $368 million of realized capital gains. Life insurance growth improved due to an increase in single premium life insurance sales in Japan as a result of further bank deregulation effective in December 2005. The expansion of the bank distribution platform for single premium life insurance products adds to the existing multiple distribution platforms in Japan, where AIG remains the leading foreign insurance provider. Personal accident revenues grew $258 million or 7 percent resulting in operating income growth of $71 million or 7 percent. Personal accident operating income includes the effect of higher terminations of certain accident and health policies in Japan which increased expenses by $54 million in 2006. The higher terminations are a result of a change in the Japanese tax regulations that reduced the tax deduction for premiums. AIGs Japanese operations have experienced lower sales and higher terminations of these contracts. DAC related to these accident 54 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries and health policies in force at December 31, 2006 totaled $214 million. In response to the tax law change, AIG has introduced new products, both life and health, to meet the needs of clients in that market. AIG continues to believe that the effect of future policy terminations will not be material to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Revenues from group products increased in 2006 by $320 million, to $2.3 billion, resulting in an increase in operating income of $81 million to $272 million. Fixed annuity reserves continued to grow due to positive net flows, but demand for U.S. dollar fixed annuities has slowed due to a weaker Japanese Yen. The individual fixed annuity revenues grew $302 million to $2.3 billion resulting in an increase in operating income of $163 million to $553 million. Growth in variable annuity deposits has accelerated compared to 2005 due to new product offerings and stronger equity markets, resulting in higher fees and policy charges included in GAAP premiums. Variable annuity revenues declined in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower policyholder trading gains which comprise the entirety of variable annuity net investment income. Policyholder trading gains are offset by an equal increase in policy benefits expense, as all investment returns for these variable annuities accrue to the benefit of the policyholder. 2005 and 2004 Comparison In 2005, total revenues for the Japan and Other reporting unit grew $3.1 billion to $15.3 billion, including policyholder trading gains of $1.3 billion. Operating income grew $566 million to $3.0 billion. Compared to 2004, results reported in U.S. dollars were negatively affected by foreign exchange, particularly the weakening of the Japanese Yen to the U.S. dollar. In addition, Japan and Other operating income was negatively affected by the runoff of older higher margin in force business of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life. Life insurance operating income grew primarily due to lower realized capital losses and higher GAAP premiums. Personal accident operating income continued to report stable profit margins and grew $119 million to $1.05 billion. Group operating income grew to $191 million on strong growth in ALICO operations outside of Japan. Individual fixed annuities operating income grew to $390 million, primarily from strong growth of net flows that increased underlying reserves in Japan. Individual fixed annuity operating income for 2005 included a charge of $47 million related to the unwinding of certain businesses in Chile that were sold in 2006. Individual variable annuities operating income grew to $47 million on higher average reserves. Net investment income for individual variable annuities grew to $767 million in 2005 and represents policyholder trading gains (losses) that are offset by an equal amount in incurred policy losses and benefits. Asia 2006 and 2005 Comparison Revenues for Asia grew $1.9 billion in 2006 to $17.9 billion. Operating income grew $774 million, to $3.1 billion, including realized capital gains of $301 million. Revenues and operating income in 2006 include $208 million and $137 million, respectively, from out of period adjustments related to certain investments in unit trusts. GAAP premiums grew 4 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. The GAAP premium growth rate was negatively affected by the continuing trend towards investment oriented products in Asia as only a portion of policy charges collected from the customers are reported as GAAP premiums. AIGs Life Insurance operations in Asia have responded to this trend by offering a wide array of investment linked products, with multiple fund choices but with minimal investment guarantees. Operating income benefited in 2006 from an out of period reduction in participating policyholder dividend reserves of $163 million, primarily as a result of tax remediation adjustments and a correction to expense allocations between participating and non participating accounts. Certain participating policyholder dividend reserves are determined on an after tax basis and as a result any change in the local tax provision will have a partially offsetting, but not equal, effect on participating policyholder dividend reserves. The amount of the offsetting effect depends on the level of participation required by law or regulation in that specific country or by the participation level provided for in the underlying contracts. In 2005, operating income for Asia included a charge of $137 million related to an increase in participating policyholder dividends as a result of the settlement of a tax dispute in Singapore. Life insurance revenues grew $1.4 billion to $15.4 billion in 2006, including realized capital gains of $258 million and policyholder trading gains of $552 million, helped by strong growth in investment linked products throughout Asia. Operating income grew $609 million, including adjustments in 2006 and 2005 for participating policyholder dividend reserves mentioned above. Operating income includes the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segments equal share of the results of AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan), which amounted to a loss of $47 million in 2006 compared to a gain of $26 million in 2005. Personal accident revenues grew 28 percent to $1.7 billion, reflecting increased focus on risk based accident and health products. The growth in revenues resulted in operating income of $337 million for the year, an increase of 40 percent over 2005. Group products revenues increased $72 million from 2005, to $627 million, resulting in operating income growth of $47 million to $178 million. 2005 and 2004 Comparison In 2005, revenues were essentially unchanged at $16.0 billion on lower realized capital gains that declined $372 million, due to lower gains on derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating income declined in 2005 by $169 million due to the decrease in realized capital gains and an increase in liabilities for participating policyholder dividends of $137 million as a result of the settlement of a tax dispute in Singapore. Life insurance GAAP premiums grew $310 million to $10.8 billion. Life insurance operating income did not grow in 2005 due to the effect of the additional par policy dividend reserves previously noted and Form 10 K 2006 AIG 55 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued lower realized capital gains. Personal accident operating income declined primarily due to realized capital losses in 2005 compared to realized capital gains in 2004. Group products GAAP premiums dropped in 2005 compared to 2004. 2004 GAAP premiums included premiums of approximately $640 million from a single reinsurance transaction involving terminal funding business, which is offset by a similar increase in benefit reserves. Domestic Life Insurance Results Domestic Life Insurance results, presented on a sub product basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Net Realized Operating GAAP Investment Capital Gains Total Income (in millions) Premiums Income (Losses) Revenues (Loss) 2006 Life insurance(a) $ 2,127 $ 1,377 $ (83 ) $ 3,421 $ 654 Home service 790 630 (38 ) 1,382 282 Group life/health 995 213 (8 ) 1,200 (159 ) Payout annuities(b) 1,582 1,004 (51 ) 2,535 76 Individual fixed annuities 4 77 (8 ) 73 8 Individual annuities runoff(c) 45 477 (27 ) 495 56 Total $ 5,543 $ 3,778 $ (215 ) $ 9,106 $ 917 2005 Life insurance(a) $ 2,041 $ 1,352 $ 98 $ 3,491 $ 874 Home service 801 605 (2 ) 1,404 282 Group life/health 1,079 201 (1 ) 1,279 69 Payout annuities(b) 1,473 912 (34 ) 2,351 128 Individual fixed annuities 3 47 50 7 Individual annuities runoff(c) 50 616 (26 ) 640 135 Total $ 5,447 $ 3,733 $ 35 $ 9,215 $ 1,495 2004 Life insurance(a) $ 1,821 $ 1,228 $ (94 ) $ 2,955 $ 612 Home service 812 608 (18 ) 1,402 290 Group life/health 1,195 182 1,377 (131 ) Payout annuities(b) 1,484 801 (8 ) 2,277 124 Individual fixed annuities 4 22 3 29 1 Individual annuities runoff(c) 60 618 (3 ) 675 127 Total $ 5,376 $ 3,459 $ (120 ) $ 8,715 $ 1,023 (a) Effective January 1, 2006, the broker dealer operations of the Domestic Life Insurance companies are being reported and managed within the Asset Management segment. Included in GAAP premiums and Total Revenues were revenues of $102 million and $96 million, respectively, for 2005 and 2004. (b) GAAP Premiums and Total Revenues include structured settlements, single premium immediate annuities and terminal funding annuities. (c) Primarily represents runoff annuity business sold through discontinued distribution relationships. 56 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table reflects periodic Domestic Life insurance sales by product for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively: Domestic Life Insurance (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Periodic Premium Sales By Product*: Universal life $ 334 $ 271 $ 201 Variable universal life 56 44 79 Term life 240 229 215 Whole life/other 13 10 13 Total $ 643 $ 554 $ 508 * Periodic premium represents premium from new business expected to be collected over a one year period. 2006 and 2005 Comparison GAAP premiums for Domestic Life Insurance were $5.5 billion in 2006, a 2 percent increase compared to 2005. Overall, periodic life insurance sales grew by 16 percent, compared to 2005, reflecting increased growth from the independent distribution platform. During the second half of 2006, certain universal life products were re priced and underwriting standards were tightened, which could affect future periodic life insurance sales. GAAP premiums from AGLA, AIGs home service business, declined slightly in 2006 as the reduction of premium in force from normal lapses and maturities exceeded sales growth for the period. GAAP premiums for group life/health for 2006 declined over the prior year primarily due to restructuring efforts in certain product lines, including the financial institutions credit life business and the employer benefits business. The GAAP premium growth from payout annuities for 2006 reflects increased sales of single premium annuities and structured settlements when compared to 2005. At December 31, 2006, AIG effectively exited the financial institutions credit business through a third party indemnity reinsurance agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007, subject to normal closing requirements, including regulatory approval. GAAP premiums in 2006 related to this business were approximately $100 million. Domestic Life Insurance operating income of $917 million declined by 39 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to several significant transactions, including a $125 million charge resulting from the loss of the Superior National arbitration. For a further discussion of the Superior National arbitration see Note 12(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Domestic Life operating income was negatively affected by a $55 million accrual related to other litigation and a $66 million loss related to exiting the financial institutions credit business. Life insurance operating income decreased by $220 million or 25 percent for 2006 due to a $45 million decrease in partnership income, $30 million in litigation related charges and realized capital losses that offset growth in the underlying business. Home service operating income was flat compared with 2005 due to increased net investment income from partnerships and lower acquisition costs and catastrophe losses, partially offset by a DAC unlocking charge of $11 million and higher realized capital losses. Group life/health operating income for 2006 was lower than 2005 primarily due to the $125 million Superior National charge and the $66 million loss associated with the exit from the financial institutions credit business. The group life/health lines operating income was also affected by a $25 million charge for litigation reserves. Payout annuities operating income declined for 2006 due to lower calls and tenders on fixed maturity securities. In addition, various methodologies and assumptions were enhanced for payout annuity reserves, resulting in a $24 million increase to the payout annuity reserves. Individual annuities runoff operating income is down from 2005 due to the decline in the block of business and the related DAC unlocking charge of $30 million to reflect lower in force amounts. 2005 and 2004 Comparison The Domestic Life Insurance operations in 2005 had continued growth in term and universal life sales with good performance from the independent distribution channels. GAAP premiums for life insurance grew 12 percent in 2005 reflecting consistently strong sales from the independent distribution platform. Payout annuities declined slightly due to the low interest rate environment and the competitive market conditions for structured settlement and single premiums individual annuity business. Home service GAAP premiums were essentially flat in this slow growth business. The group life/health GAAP premiums declined by $116 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to the non renewal of several accounts where pricing was unacceptable and loss experience was higher than anticipated. Domestic Life Insurance operating income of $1.5 billion increased 46 percent in 2005 resulting from increased realized capital gains, higher partnership income and growth in the underlying business compared to 2004. Life insurance operating income was up 43 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due in part to growth in the underlying business, improved mortality results and higher realized capital gains, offset by higher losses from partnership investments in synthetic fuel production facilities. Home service operating income declined as a result of a reduction in premiums in force and higher insurance and acquisitions expenses, combined with an increase in losses related to hurricanes. Group life/health operating income was affected by the non renewal of cases where acceptable margins could not be achieved. Operating income in 2004 includes a $178 million charge related to a workers compensation quota share reinsurance agreement with Superior National. In addition, in 2004, as part of the business review of group life/health, approximately $68 million was incurred for reserve strengthening and allowances for receivables. Payout annuities operating income increased 3 percent as growth in the business base was offset by higher realized capital losses. Individual annuities runoff operating income increased in 2005 primarily as a result of lower operating expenses offset by higher realized capital losses when compared to 2004. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 57 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Domestic Retirement Services Results Domestic Retirement Services results, presented on a sub product basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Net Realized GAAP Investment Capital Gains Total Operating (in millions) Premiums Income (Losses) Revenue Income 2006 Group retirement products $ 386 $ 2,279 $ (144 ) $ 2,521 $ 1,017 Individual fixed annuities 122 3,581 (257 ) 3,446 1,036 Individual variable annuities 531 202 5 738 193 Individual annuities runoff* 18 426 (8 ) 436 77 Total $ 1,057 $ 6,488 $ (404 ) $ 7,141 $ 2,323 2005 Group retirement products $ 351 $ 2,233 $ (67 ) $ 2,517 $ 1,055 Individual fixed annuities 97 3,346 (214 ) 3,229 858 Individual variable annuities 467 217 4 688 189 Individual annuities runoff* 22 430 452 62 Total $ 937 $ 6,226 $ (277 ) $ 6,886 $ 2,164 2004 Group retirement products $ 313 $ 2,201 $ (111 ) $ 2,403 $ 987 Individual fixed annuities 55 3,078 (78 ) 3,055 851 Individual variable annuities 407 239 (17 ) 629 176 Individual annuities runoff* 20 458 (1 ) 477 40 Total $ 795 $ 5,976 $ (207 ) $ 6,564 $ 2,054 * Primarily represents runoff annuity business sold through discontinued distribution relationships. 2006 and 2005 Comparison Domestic Retirement Services total deposits decreased slightly for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in total deposits reflects lower fixed annuity sales that continued to face increased competition from bank deposit products and money market funds offering very competitive short term rates in the flat yield curve environment. This was partially offset by substantially higher individual variable annuity sales and group mutual fund deposits. Individual variable annuity deposits grew 29 percent in 2006 from 2005, reflecting growth in products with living benefit guarantee features. Group retirement deposits grew 6 percent in 2006, reflecting 51 percent growth in group mutual fund sales partially offset by a 1 percent sales drop in annuity deposits. Over time, this will result in a gradual reduction in overall profit margins of this business driven by the growth in the lower margin mutual fund products relative to the annuity products. Fixed annuity surrender rates increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to products coming out of their surrender charge period and the increased competition from banks. Individual fixed annuity net flows for 2006 were negative $2.7 billion compared to positive net flows of $1.3 billion in 2005, reflecting both the lower deposits and higher surrenders, caused by the flat or inverted yield curve. Total domestic retirement service operating income for 2006 of $2.3 billion increased 7 percent from 2005. Group retirement products total revenues were flat in 2006 primarily due to improvements in partnership income and variable annuity fees being offset by increased capital losses. The flat revenues, coupled with higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to internal replacements of existing contracts into new contracts, resulted in a 4 percent decrease in group retirement operating income. Total revenues for individual fixed annuities were up 7 percent in 2006 and operating income was up 21 percent primarily driven by higher partnership and yield enhancement income. Individual variable annuity total revenues were up 7 percent in 2006, primarily driven by higher variable annuity fees resulting from the increase in the equity markets. Offsetting somewhat the growth in total revenues was an increase in DAC amortization resulting from increased surrender activity in the first half of 2006, with operating income up 2 percent for the year. In 2006, the individual annuities runoff operating income increased $15 million even though the underlying reserves decreased. The higher income in 2006 was primarily due to increased net spreads as a result of higher investment yields partially offset by increased realized capital losses and lower volumes due to the continued runoff of the business. 2005 and 2004 Comparison The Domestic Retirement Services businesses faced a challenging environment in 2005, as deposits declined approximately 18 percent from 2004. The decrease in AIGs individual variable annuity product sales in 2005 was largely attributable to significant variable annuity sales declines at several of AIGs largest distribution firms due to lackluster equity markets, more intense industry competition with regard to living benefit product features and heightened compliance procedures over selling practices. AIGs introduction of more competitive guaranteed minimum withdrawal features was delayed until late in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to filing delays associated with the restatements. During 2005, the interest yield curve flattened and, as a result, competing bank products such as certificates of deposit and other 58 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries money market instruments with shorter durations than AIGs individual fixed annuity products became more attractive. Total Domestic Retirement Services operating income for 2005 of $2.2 billion increased 5 percent compared to 2004 operating income of $2.1 billion. Total revenues for the group retirement products increased 5 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 while operating income increased 7 percent, primarily due to higher variable annuity fee income and lower realized capital losses. Individual fixed annuity total revenues were up 6 percent in 2005 primarily due to an increase in net investment income, partially offset by higher realized capital losses. Operating income for individual fixed annuities increased primarily due to the increase in net investment income from growth in average reserves and higher surrender charges, partially offset by the higher level of realized capital losses. Individual variable annuities total revenues were up 9 percent in 2005, primarily driven by higher variable annuity fees resulting from the increase in the equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2004 and an increase in realized capital gains. The 7 percent growth in individual variable annuities income was consistent with the overall growth in reserves. In 2005, the individual annuities runoff operating income increased $22 million even though the underlying reserves decreased. The higher income in 2005 was due to lower interest crediting rates and lower DAC amortization due to lower surrenders. Domestic Retirement Services Supplemental Data The following table presents deposits for 2006, 2005 and 2004: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Group retirement products: Annuities $ 5,464 $ 5,532 $ 5,555 Mutual funds 1,361 904 947 Individual fixed annuities 5,330 6,861 9,713 Individual variable annuities 4,266 3,319 4,126 Individual fixed annuities runoff 56 67 77 Total $ 16,477 $ 16,683 $ 20,418 The following table presents the amount of reserves by surrender charge category as of December 31, 2006: Group Individual Individual Retirement Fixed Variable (in millions) Products* Annuities Annuities Zero or no surrender charge $ 42,741 $ 10,187 $ 11,467 0% 2% 6,921 4,503 4,869 Greater than 2% 4% 4,573 6,422 4,830 Greater than 4% 2,842 28,109 9,836 Non Surrenderable 877 3,464 91 Total $ 57,954 $ 52,685 $ 31,093 * Excludes mutual funds. In 2006, surrender rates increased for individual fixed annuities, group retirement products and individual variable annuities. The increase in surrender rate for fixed annuities continues to be driven by the shape of the yield curve and general aging of the in force block; however, less than 20 percent of the individual fixed annuity reserves as of December 31, 2006 were available to be surrendered without charge. Surrender rates for group retirement products increased only slightly as a result of successful retention efforts. In 2006, new products were introduced to retain assets and AIG has retained or attracted over $1 billion in assets. Individual variable annuity surrender rates for 2006 primarily reflect higher shock lapses that occur following expiration of the surrender charge period on certain 3 year and 7 year contracts, although the trend moderated during the year. Reflecting a widespread industry phenomenon, this lapse rate, much of which was anticipated when the products were issued, has recently been affected by investor demand to exchange existing policies for new generation contracts with living benefits or lower fees. In addition, the high lapse rates are in part due to the surrenders within certain acquired blocks of business. A further increase in the level of surrenders in any of these businesses or in the individual fixed annuities runoff block could accelerate the amortization of DAC and negatively affect fee income earned on assets under management. The following table presents the net flows by line of business for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Net Flows(a) (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Group retirement products(b) $ 467 $ 628 $ 1,706 Individual fixed annuities (2,697 ) 1,288 5,936 Individual variable annuities (114 ) (336 ) 1,145 Individual fixed annuities runoff (1,009 ) (818 ) (714 ) Total $ (3,353 ) $ 762 $ 8,073 (a) Net flows are defined as deposits received less benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and death benefits. (b) Includes mutual funds. The combination of lower deposits and higher surrenders in the individual fixed annuity and individual fixed annuity runoff blocks, which include closed blocks of business from acquired companies or terminated distribution relationships, resulted in negative net flows for 2006. The continuation of the current interest rate and competitive environment could prolong this trend.

(c) Relates principally to assets held in various trading securities accounts that do not qualify for separate account treatment under SOP 03 1. These amounts are offset by an equal change included in incurred policy losses and benefits. (d) Includes call and tender income. The following table summarizes Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services partnership income (losses) by sub product line for 2006, 2005 and 2004: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Domestic Life excluding Synfuels: Life insurance $ 67 $ 136 $ 43 Home service 13 (1 ) 8 Subtotal 80 135 51 Domestic Life Synfuels: Life insurance (73 ) (97 ) (74 ) Home service (34 ) (46 ) (47 ) Subtotal (107 ) (143 ) (121 ) Total Domestic Life (27 ) (8 ) (70 ) Retirement Services: Group retirement products 178 89 95 Individual fixed annuities 247 135 147 Total Retirement Services 425 224 242 Total $ 398 $ 216 $ 172 2006 and 2005 Comparison Net investment income increased 7 percent for 2006 compared to 2005 as income from fixed maturity and equity securities increased as levels of invested assets grew. Net investment income in 2006 also included out of period adjustments relating to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts of $240 million. Partially offsetting this growth were lower policyholder trading gains (losses) in 2006. Net Investment income for certain operations include investments in structured notes linked to emerging market sovereign debt that incorporates both interest rate risk and currency risk. In addition, period to period comparisons of investment income for some lines of business are affected by yield enhancement activity, particularly partnership income as shown in the above table. See also Insurance and Asset Management Invested Assets herein. 60 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIG generates income tax credits as a result of investing in synthetic fuel production (synfuels) related to the investment loss shown in the above table and records those benefits in its provision for income taxes. The amounts of those income tax credits were $127 million, $203 million and $160 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For a further discussion of the effect of fluctuating domestic crude oil prices on synfuel tax credits, see Note 12(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 and 2004 Comparison The growth in net investment income in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects growth in general account reserves and surplus for both Foreign and Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies. Also, net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income along with the addition of new cash flow from operations available for investment. The global flattening of the yield curve put additional pressure on yields and spreads, which was partially offset with income generated from other investment sources, including income from partnerships. The following table summarizes realized capital gains (losses) by major category for 2006, 2005 and 2004: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Domestic Life Insurance: Sales of fixed maturities $ (33 ) $ 65 $ (4 ) Sales of equity securities 17 18 7 Other: Foreign exchange transactions (6 ) 11 Derivatives instruments 25 65 8 Other than temporary decline (192 ) (119 ) (98 ) Other (26 ) (5 ) (33 ) Total Domestic Life Insurance $ (215 ) $ 35 $ (120 ) Domestic Retirement Services: Sales of fixed maturities $ 1 $ (106 ) $ 107 Sales of equity securities 31 115 30 Other: Foreign exchange transactions (13 ) Derivatives instruments (33 ) (12 ) (14 ) Other than temporary decline (368 ) (267 ) (305 ) Other (22 ) (7 ) (25 ) Total Domestic Retirement Services $ (404 ) $ (277 ) $ (207 ) Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Sales of fixed maturities $ (209 ) $ 191 $ 223 Sales of equity securities 459 281 295 Other: Foreign exchange transactions 106 40 (382 ) Derivatives instruments 276 (599 ) 248 Other than temporary decline (81 ) (39 ) (38 ) Other* 156 210 26 Total Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services $ 707 $ 84 $ 372 Total $ 88 $ (158 ) $ 45 * Net of allocations to participating policyholders of $88 million, $109 million and $65 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Realized capital gains (losses) include normal portfolio transactions as well as derivative gains (losses) for transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, transactional foreign exchange gains and losses and other than temporary declines in the value of investments. Realized capital gains (losses) for derivatives in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services are related primarily to hedging of fixed income instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective country to such functional currency. The related currency gain or loss of the available for sale fixed income instrument is deferred until the date of the sale. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment type products, including variable and fixed annuities (investment oriented products), are deferred and amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Total acquisition costs deferred increased $310 million over 2005 and were generally in line with growth in new business. Total DAC amortization expense, excluding VOBA, grew $432 million over 2005 with each years amortization expense level at approximately 14 percent of the opening DAC balance. Amortization expense includes the effects of current period realized capital gains and losses for investment type products. With respect to investment oriented products, AIGs policy is to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIGs variable annuity business), the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC amortization is approximately ten percent. A methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption, while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses less interest required on policyholder reserves, as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the effect on the amortization of DAC. The projection of estimated gross profits requires significant management judgment. The assumptions with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted accordingly. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 61 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC and Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) for 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 (in millions) DAC VOBA Total DAC VOBA Total Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Balance at beginning of year(a) $ 9,599 $ 869 $ 10,468 $ 8,214 $ 836 $ 9,050 Acquisition costs deferred 1,832 1,832 1,840 1,840 Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income: Related to realized capital gains (losses) 77 16 93 45 3 48 Related to unlocking future assumptions (40 ) (5 ) (45 ) (15 ) (15 ) All other amortization(b) (1,387 ) (81 ) (1,468 ) (1,399 ) (85 ) (1,484 ) Related to change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities 744 34 778 904 112 1,016 Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange (1 ) (1 ) 10 3 13 Balance at end of year $ 10,824 $ 833 $ 11,657 $ 9,599 $ 869 $ 10,468 Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Balance at beginning of year(a) $ 16,360 $ 1,278 $ 17,638 $ 14,349 $ 1,681 $ 16,030 Acquisition costs deferred 4,991 4,991 4,673 4,673 Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income: Related to realized capital gains (losses) 4 1 5 (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) Related to unlocking future assumptions 87 15 102 93 93 All other amortization (2,214 ) (185 ) (2,399 ) (1,764 ) (204 ) (1,968 ) Related to change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities (127 ) (5 ) (132 ) (47 ) 8 (39 ) Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange 904 44 948 (943 ) (206 ) (1,149 ) Balance at end of year $ 20,005 $ 1,148 $ 21,153 $ 16,360 $ 1,278 $ 17,638 Total Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Balance at beginning of year(a) $ 25,959 $ 2,147 $ 28,106 $ 22,563 $ 2,517 $ 25,080 Acquisition costs deferred 6,823 6,823 6,513 6,513 Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income: Related to realized capital gains (losses) 81 17 98 44 2 46 Related to unlocking future assumptions 47 10 57 78 78 All other amortization (3,601 ) (266 ) (3,867 ) (3,163 ) (289 ) (3,452 ) Related to change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities 617 29 646 857 120 977 Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange 903 44 947 (933 ) (203 ) (1,136 ) Balance at end of year $ 30,829 $ 1,981 $ 32,810 $ 25,959 $ 2,147 $ 28,106 (a) In 2006, sales inducement assets were reclassified to Other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this reclassification. (b) In 2006, all other amortization for Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services includes $136 million of negative amortization related to changes in estimates from conversion of actuarial systems, which is substantially offset by related adjustments in incurred policy losses and benefits in the consolidated statement of income. AIGs variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes in market returns because separate account revenues, primarily composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management fees, are a function of asset values. DAC for both insurance oriented and investment oriented products as well as retirement services products is reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review also involves significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially lower than estimated, AIGs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods. 62 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Financial Services Operations AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Financial Services Results Financial Services results for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues(a): Aircraft Leasing(b) $ 4,143 $ 3,578 $ 3,136 Capital Markets(c)(d) (186 ) 3,260 1,278 Consumer Finance(e) 3,819 3,613 2,978 Other 234 74 103 Total $ 8,010 $ 10,525 $ 7,495 Operating income (loss)(a): Aircraft Leasing $ 639 $ 679 $ 642 Capital Markets(d) (873 ) 2,661 662 Consumer Finance(f) 761 876 786 Other, including intercompany adjustments(g) (3 ) 60 90 Total $ 524 $ 4,276 $ 2,180 (a) Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the effect was $(1.8) billion, $2.0 billion and $(122) million in both revenues and operating income for Capital Markets. These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are economically hedging available for sale securities and borrowings. For 2004, the effect was $(27) million in operating income for Aircraft Leasing. During 2006 and 2005, Aircraft Leasing derivative gains and losses were reported as part of AIGs Other category, and were not reported in Aircraft Leasing operating income. (b) Revenues are primarily aircraft lease rentals from ILFC. (c) Revenues, shown net of interest expense of $3.2 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were primarily from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions and the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 described in (a) above. (d) Certain transactions entered into by AIGFP generate tax credits and benefits which are included in income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The amounts of such tax credits and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are $50 million, $67 million and $107 million. (e) Revenues are primarily finance charges. (f) Includes catastrophe related losses of $62 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 resulting from hurricane Katrina, which were reduced by $35 million in 2006 due to the reevaluation of the remaining estimated losses. (g) Includes specific reserves recorded during 2006 in the amount of $42 million related to two commercial lending transactions. Financial Services operating income decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting in the first quarter of 2007 for AIGFP and later in 2007 for the balance of the Financial Services operations. Aircraft Leasing AIGs Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for ILFCs own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were 5.17 percent and 4.61 percent, respectively. The composite borrowing rates did not reflect the benefit of economically hedging ILFCs floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt using interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. These derivatives are effective economic hedges; however, since hedge accounting under FAS 133 was not applied, the benefits of using derivatives to hedge these exposures were not reflected in ILFCs borrowing rates. ILFCs sources of revenue are principally from scheduled and charter airlines and companies associated with the airline industry. The airline industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and is cyclical and highly competitive. Airlines and related companies may be affected by political or economic instability, terrorist activities, changes in national policy, competitive pressures on certain air carriers, fuel prices and shortages, labor stoppages, insurance costs, recessions, world health issues and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets. ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFCs revenues and operating income may be adversely affected by the volatile competitive environment in which its customers operate. ILFC manages the risk of nonperformance by its lessees with security deposit requirements, repossession rights, overhaul requirements and close monitoring of industry conditions through its marketing force. However, there can be no assurance that ILFC would be able to successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Approximately 90 percent of ILFCs fleet is leased to non U.S. carriers, and the fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFC typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had one aircraft off lease at December 31, 2006, and all new aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2007 have been leased. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFCs fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on Form 10 K 2006 AIG 63 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet in 2006, 2005 and 2004. ILFC has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates that would result in an impairment under FAS 144. Aircraft Leasing Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison ILFCs operating income decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 by $40 million, or 6 percent. Rental revenues increased by $536 million or 16 percent, driven by a larger aircraft fleet, increased utilization and higher lease rates. During 2006, ILFCs fleet subject to operating leases increased by 78 airplanes to a total of 824. The increase in rental revenues was offset in part by increases in depreciation expense and interest expense, charges related to bankrupt airlines, as well as the settlement of a tax dispute in Australia related to the restructuring of ownership of aircraft. Depreciation expense increased by $200 million, or 14 percent, in line with the increase in the size of the aircraft fleet. Interest expense increased by $317 million, or 28 percent, driven by rising cost of funds, a weaker U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound and additional borrowings funding aircraft purchases. As noted above, ILFCs interest expense did not reflect the benefit of hedging these exposures. Gains or losses on derivatives for ILFC are reported in AIGs Other category. 2005 and 2004 Comparison ILFCs operating income increased in 2005 compared to 2004 by $37 million, or 6 percent. Rental revenues increased by $499 million, or 17 percent, driven by a larger aircraft fleet and increased utilization. During 2005, ILFCs fleet subject to operating leases increased by 79 airplanes to a total of 746. The increase in rental revenues was offset in part by increases in depreciation expense, interest expense, leasing related costs and other reserves. Depreciation expense increased by $111 million, or 9 percent, in line with the increase in the size of the aircraft fleet. Interest expense increased by $132 million, or 13 percent, driven by rising cost of funds and additional borrowings funding aircraft purchases. Capital Markets Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engages as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and engages in borrowing activities involving issuing standard and structured notes and other securities, and entering into GIAs. As Capital Markets is a transaction oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. AIGs Capital Markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. AIGFP also participates as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. AIGFP economically hedges the market risks arising from its transactions, although hedge accounting under FAS 133 was not being applied during 2006, 2005 and 2004 to any of the derivatives and related assets and liabilities. Accordingly, revenues and operating income were exposed to volatility resulting from differences in the timing of revenue recognition between the derivatives and the hedged assets and liabilities. Revenues and operating income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are also significantly affected by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Generally, the realization of transaction revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on AIGFPs trading transactions is currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of AIGFP operations. Derivatives are recorded at fair value, determined by reference to the mark to market value of the derivative or their estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available. The resulting aggregate unrealized gains or losses from the derivatives are reflected in the consolidated income statement. Where AIGFP cannot verify significant model inputs to observable market data and cannot verify the model value to market transactions, AIGFP values the contract at the transaction price at inception and, consequently, records no initial gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 03, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02 03). Such initial gain or loss is recognized over the life of the transaction. AIGFP periodically reevaluates its revenue recognition under EITF 02 03 based on the observability of market parameters. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in the captions Unrealized gain on swaps, options and forward transactions and Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward transactions. Unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable, by counterparty, and the unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable, by counterparty, as of December 31, 2006. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity and commodity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. Spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are classified as securities available for sale and are carried at fair value with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. U.S. dollar denominated borrowings are carried at cost, while borrowings in any currency other than the U.S. dollar result in unrealized foreign 64 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries exchange gains or losses reported in income. AIGFP hedges the economic exposure on its investments and borrowings on a portfolio basis using derivatives and other financial instruments. While these hedges are highly effective economic hedges, they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 through 2006. The change in the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge these economic exposures is therefore included in Other income, while the offsetting change in fair value of the hedged investments and borrowings is not recognized in income. AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting in the first quarter of 2007 for AIGFP. To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than AIGFP, use derivatives to economically hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, the changes in fair value of such derivatives were recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other income. Amounts recorded in realized capital gains (losses) are reported as part of AIGs Other category. Capital Markets Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison Capital Markets operating income in 2006 decreased by $3.53 billion compared to 2005. Improved results, primarily from increased transaction flow in AIGFPs credit, commodity index, energy and equity products, were more than offset by the loss resulting from the effect of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. This loss was $1.82 billion in 2006 compared to a gain of $2.01 billion in 2005, a decrease of $3.83 billion. A large part of the net loss on AIGFPs derivatives recognized in 2006 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the British Pound and Euro, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging AIGFPs available for sale securities. The majority of the net gain on AIGFPs derivatives in 2005 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the British Pound and Euro, which increased the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities. To a lesser extent, the net gain in 2005 was due to the decrease in long term U.S. interest rates, which increased the fair value of derivatives hedging AIGFPs assets and liabilities. Financial market conditions in 2006 were characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed income markets globally, tightening of credit spreads, higher equity valuations and a weaker U.S. dollar. The most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses is compensation, which was approximately $544 million, $481 million and $497 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses arising from derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. AIG elected to early adopt FAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (FAS 155), in 2006 and AIGFP elected to apply the fair value option to its structured notes and other financial liabilities containing embedded derivatives outstanding as of January 1, 2006. The cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 155 on these instruments at January 1, 2006 was a pre tax loss of $29 million. The effect of these hybrid financial instruments reflected in AIGFPs operating income in 2006 was a pretax loss of $287 million, largely offset by gains on economic hedge positions also reflected in AIGFPs operating income. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Capital Markets operating income in 2005 increased by $2 billion compared to 2004, primarily due to a gain related to derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment of $2.01 billion in 2005 compared to a loss of $122 million in 2004. The majority of the net gain on AIGFPs derivatives recognized in 2005 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound, which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities. To a lesser extent, the net gain was also due to the fall in long term U.S. interest rates, which resulted in an increase in the fair value of AIGFPs interest rate derivatives hedging its assets and liabilities. The majority of the net loss on AIGFPs derivatives recognized in 2004 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound, which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities. This loss was partially offset by an increase in the fair value of its interest rate derivatives hedging its assets and liabilities as a result of the decrease in long term U.S. interest rates. Financial market conditions in 2005 compared to 2004 were characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed income markets globally, some tightening of credit spreads, higher equity valuations and a stronger U.S. dollar. AIGFPs 2005 results were adversely affected by customer uncertainty surrounding the negative actions of the rating agencies and the investigations, as well as the negative effect on its structured notes business of AIG being unable to fully access the capital markets during 2005. Capital Markets operating income was also negatively affected in 2004 by the costs of the PNC settlement. Consumer Finance AIGs consumer finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. Effective January 2, 2007, AGF expanded its operations into the United Kingdom through the acquisition of Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited, a finance broker for home owner loans in the United Kingdom. AGF derives a substantial portion of its revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding real estate loans, secured and unsecured non real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables. The real estate loans are comprised principally of first lien and some second lien mortgages on residential real estate generally having a maximum term of 360 months, and are considered non conforming. The real estate loans may be closed end accounts or open end home equity lines of credit and may be fixed rate or adjustable rate products. AGF does not offer mortgage products Form 10 K 2006 AIG 65 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued with borrower payment options that allow for negative amortization of the principal balance. The secured non real estate loans are secured by consumer goods, automobiles or other personal property. Both secured and unsecured non real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables generally have a maximum term of 60 months. The core of AGFs originations is sourced through its branches. However, a significant volume of real estate loans is also originated through broker relationships, and to lesser extents, through correspondent relationships and direct mail solicitations. In the first quarter of 2006, two wholly owned subsidiaries of AGF discontinued originating real estate loans through an arrangement with AIG Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered thrift, and began originating such loans under their own state licenses. AIGs foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. AIGCFG has operations in Argentina, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Taiwan and Thailand. Certain of the AIGCFG operations are owned in part or in whole by Life Insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, the financial results of those companies are shared between Financial Services and Life Insurance & Retirement Services according to their ownership percentages. While products vary by market, the businesses generally provide credit cards, unsecured and secured non real estate loans, term deposits, savings accounts, retail sales finance and real estate loans. AIGCFG originates finance receivables through its branches and direct solicitation. AIGCFG also originates finance receivables indirectly through relationships with retailers, auto dealers, and independent agents. Consumer Finance Results 2006 and 2005 Comparison Consumer Finance operating income decreased to $761 million, or 13 percent, in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating income from domestic consumer finance operations declined as a result of decreased originations and purchases of real estate loans and margin compression resulting from increased interest rates and flattened yield curves. The foreign operations operating income decreased primarily due to the credit deterioration in the Taiwan credit card market. Domestically, the U.S. housing market deteriorated throughout 2006 and ended the year fairly weak compared to recent years. As a result, the real estate loan portfolio decreased slightly during 2006 due to lower refinancing activity. This lower refinancing activity also caused a significant decrease in originations and whole loan sales in AGFs mortgage banking operation, which resulted in a substantial reduction of revenue and operating income compared to the prior year. However, softening home prices (reducing the equity customers are able to extract from their homes when refinancing) and higher mortgage rates contributed to customers utilizing non real estate loans, which increased 10 percent compared to 2005. Retail sales finance receivables also increased 23 percent due to increased marketing efforts and customer demand. Higher revenue resulting from portfolio growth was more than offset by higher interest expense. AGFs short term borrowing rates were 5.14 percent in 2006 compared to 3.58 percent in 2005. AGFs long term borrowing rates were 5.05 percent in 2006 compared to 4.41 percent in 2005. AGFs net charge off ratio improved to 0.95 percent in 2006 from 1.19 percent in 2005. The improvement in the net charge off ratio in 2006 was primarily due to positive economic fundamentals. The U.S. economy continued to expand during the year, and the unemployment rate remained low, which improved the credit quality of AGFs portfolio. AGFs delinquency ratio remained relatively low, although it increased to 2.06 percent at December 31, 2006 from 1.93 percent at December 31, 2005. AGF reduced the hurricane Katrina portion of its allowance for finance receivable losses to $15 million at December 31, 2006 after the reevaluation of its remaining estimated losses. AGFs allowance ratio was 2.01 percent at December 31, 2006 compared to 2.20 percent at December 31, 2005. Revenues from the foreign consumer finance operations increased by approximately 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Loan growth, particularly in Poland and Argentina, was the primary driver behind the higher revenues. Higher revenues were more than offset, however, by AIGCFGs $47 million share of the allowance for losses related to industry wide credit deterioration in the Taiwan credit card market, increased cost of funds, and higher operating expenses in connection with expansion into new markets and distribution channels and new product promotions, resulting in lower operating income for 2006 compared to 2005. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Revenues and operating income from the Consumer Finance operations improved in 2005, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the relatively low interest rate environment contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing activity. AGFs real estate loans increased 21 percent during 2005 compared to 2004. AGFs short term borrowing rates rose to 3.58 percent in 2005 compared to 2.68 percent in 2004. AGFs long term borrowing rates were 4.41 percent in 2005 compared to 4.28 percent in 2004. Despite high energy costs, the U.S. economy continued to expand during 2005, improving consumer credit quality. Both AGFs net charge off ratio and delinquency ratio improved in 2005 compared to 2004. AGFs net charge off ratio improved to 1.19 percent in 2005 from 1.60 percent in 2004. The improvement in the net charge off ratio in 2005 was primarily due to the improving economy and a higher proportion of average net receivables that were real estate loans. AGFs delinquency ratio at December 31, 2005 was 1.93 percent compared to 2.31 percent at December 31, 2004. However, AGF incurred charges of approximately $62 million for the estimated effect of hurricane Katrina on customers in the Gulf Coast areas affected by the storm. At December 31, 2005, AGFs allowance ratio was 2.20 percent compared to 2.26 percent at December 31, 2004. Foreign consumer finance operations performed well, as the operations in Poland and Argentina recorded improved growth in operating income. The Hong Kong businesses experienced improved loan and earnings growth in a strengthening economy. 66 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Asset Management Operations AIGs Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment related services and investment products. Such services and products are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas, and are primarily comprised of Spread Based Investment Businesses, Institutional Asset Management and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds. The revenues and operating income for this segment are subject to variability because they are affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets. In addition, realized gains and performance fees are contingent upon various fund closings, maturity levels and market conditions. Spread Based Investment Business In prior years, the sale of GICs to investors, both domestically and overseas, was AIGs primary institutional Spread Based Investment Business. During 2005, AIG launched its MIP and its asset management subsidiaries, primarily SunAmerica Life, ceased writing new GIC business. The GIC business will continue to run off for the foreseeable future while the MIP business is expected to grow. Institutional Asset Management AIGs Institutional Asset Management business provides an array of investment products and services globally to institutional investors, AIG subsidiaries and affiliates and high net worth investors. These products and services include traditional equity and fixed income investment management and a full range of alternative asset classes. Delivery of AIGs Institutional Asset Management products and services is accomplished via a global network of operating subsidiaries comprising AIGGIG. The primary operating entities within this group are AIG Global Investment Corp., AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. and AIG Private Bank. AIG Private Bank offers banking, trading and investment management services to private client and high net worth individuals and institutions globally. Within the alternative investment asset class, AIGGIG offers hedge and private equity fund of funds, direct investments and distressed debt investments. Within the structured fixed income and equity product asset class, AIGGIG offers various forms of structured and credit linked notes, various forms of collateralized debt obligations and other investment strategies aimed at achieving superior returns or capital preservation. In addition, Institutional Asset Managements product offerings include various forms of principal protected and liability management structures. Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds AIGs Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds business provides mutual fund and broker dealer related services to retail investors, group trusts and corporate accounts through an independent network of financial advisors. The AIG Advisor Group, Inc., a subsidiary of AIG Retirement Services, Inc., is comprised of several broker dealer entities that provide these services to clients primarily in the U.S. marketplace. SAAMCo manages, advises and or administers retail mutual funds, as well as the underlying assets of variable annuities sold by AIG SunAmerica and VALIC to individuals and groups throughout the United States. Other Included in the Other category for Asset Management is income or loss from partnerships. Partnership assets consist of investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, affordable housing partnerships and hedge fund investments. Asset Management Results Asset Management results for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues: Spread Based Investment Business $ 3,554 $ 3,547 $ 3,192 Institutional Asset Management 1,670 1,195 1,049 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 293 257 249 Other 297 326 224 Total $ 5,814 $ 5,325 $ 4,714 Operating income: Spread Based Investment Business(a) $ 947 $ 1,185 $ 1,328 Institutional Asset Management(b)(c) 1,031 686 515 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 87 66 70 Other 281 316 212 Total $ 2,346 $ 2,253 $ 2,125 (a) Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2004, the effect was a gain of $313 million in operating income. During 2006 and 2005, these derivative gains and losses were reported as part of AIGs Other category, and were not reported in Asset Management operating income. (b) Includes the full results of certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds that are consolidated pursuant to FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Also includes $346 million, $261 million and $195 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of third party limited partner earnings offset in minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income which is not a component of operating income. (c) Includes the full results of certain AIG managed partnerships that are consolidated effective January 1, 2006 pursuant to EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. For 2006, operating income includes $252 million of third party limited partner earnings offset in minority interest expense which is not a component of operating income. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 67 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 2006 and 2005 Comparison Asset Management operating income increased 4 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 on revenues that increased 9 percent. Operating income related to the Spread Based Investment Business declined 20 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to the continued runoff of GIC balances and spread compression related to increases in short term interest rates. A significant portion of the remaining GIC portfolio consists of floating rate obligations. AIG has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates. AIG believes these hedges are economically effective, but they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Income or loss from these hedges are classified as realized capital gains or losses and are included in AIGs Other category. The decline in operating income was partially offset by improved partnership income, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2006. Partnership income is primarily derived from alternative investments and is affected by performance in the equity markets. Thus, revenues, operating income and cash flow attributable to GICs will vary among reporting periods. Commencing with transactions initiated in the first quarter of 2007, AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting for derivative transactions related to the MIP. During 2005, the MIP replaced the GIC program as AIGs principal spread based investment activity. While the MIP showed strong growth in operating income, AIG does not expect that the income growth in the MIP will offset the runoff in the GIC portfolio for the foreseeable future, because the asset mix under the MIP does not include the alternative investments utilized in the GIC program. The MIP was initially launched in the Euromarkets in September 2005 through AIGs $10 billion Euro medium term note program. Through December 31, 2006, AIG has issued the equivalent of $5.3 billion for the MIP in the Euromarkets and the U.S. public and private markets. Operating income related to Institutional Asset Management increased 50 percent in 2006 to $1.0 billion compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase of $337 million in gains on certain VIEs and partnerships. These gains are offset in minority interest expense, which is not a component of operating income. AIGs unaffiliated client assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, increased 21 percent from year end 2005 to $75 billion, resulting in higher management fee income. Increased realized capital gains on real estate investments from 2005 also contributed to the increase in operating income. The growth in Institutional Asset Management revenues and operating income were driven by contributions from all asset classes globally. Partially offsetting this growth were lower performance based fees on private equity investments, and higher expenses related to the planned expansion of marketing and distribution capabilities, combined with technology and operational infrastructure related enhancements. 2005 and 2004 Comparison Asset Management operating income increased in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of growth in institutional assets under management, and the associated fee revenue, along with strong realized gains on sales of real estate investments and performance fees earned on various private equity investments. The increase in operating income was achieved despite the runoff of the existing GIC portfolio and the delay in the MIP. The decline in GIC operating income compared to 2004 reflects tighter spreads in the GIC portfolio, partially offset by improved partnership returns. Spread compression occurred as the base portfolio yield declined due to an increase in the cost of funds in the short term floating rate portion of the GIC portfolio, only partially offset by increased investment income from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio. Other Operations The operating loss of AIGs Other category for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Other Operating Income (Loss): Equity earnings in unconsolidated entities $ 193 $ (124 ) $ 157 Interest expense (859 ) (541 ) (435 ) Unallocated corporate expenses (555 ) (413 ) (316 ) Compensation expense SICO Plans (108 ) (205 ) (62 ) Compensation expense Starr tender offer (54 ) Realized capital gains (losses) (295 ) 505 94 Regulatory settlement costs (1,644 ) Other miscellaneous, net (23 ) (113 ) Total Other $ (1,701 ) $ (2,535 ) $ (562 ) 2006 and 2005 Comparison Operating loss for AIGs Other category declined to $1.7 billion in 2006 compared to $2.5 billion in 2005, largely due to regulatory settlement costs of $1.6 billion in 2005 as described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Interest expense grew in 2006 as a result of increased borrowings by the parent holding company. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $142 million due to increases in general corporate expenses primarily resulting from ongoing efforts to improve internal controls, higher stock compensation expenses and expenses relating to executive departures in 2005 and 2006. AIG expects these compensation expenses to continue to increase as these improvement efforts progress. Operating income in 2006 also includes realized capital losses of $295 million, primarily reflecting the effect of hedging activities in the Financial Services and Asset Management segments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Also reflected in Other operating loss in 2006 is an out of period charge of $61 million with respect to the SICO Plans and a one time charge related to the Starr tender offer of $54 million. For a further discussion of these items, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These declines were partially 68 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries offset by increased equity earnings in certain unconsolidated subsidiaries. 2005 and 2004 Comparison AIGs Other operating loss was $2.5 billion in 2005 compared to $562 million in 2004, reflecting the $1.6 billion of regulatory settlement costs in 2005. In addition, AIGs equity in certain partially owned subsidiaries includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe losses in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital Resources and Liquidity At December 31, 2006, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $101.68 billion and total consolidated borrowings of $148.68 billion. At that date, $131.55 billion of such borrowings were not guaranteed by AIG, were matched borrowings by AIG or AIGFP, or represented liabilities connected to trust preferred stock. In 2007, AIG expects to issue capital securities in one or more series. The proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of common stock or to otherwise improve the efficiency of AIGs capital structure. Borrowings At December 31, 2006, AIGs net borrowings were $17.13 billion after reflecting amounts that were matched borrowings by AIG and AIGFP, amounts not guaranteed by AIG and liabilities connected to trust preferred stock.

In July 2006, AIG filed and had declared effective a post effective amendment to its universal shelf registration statement to sell up to $25.1 billion of debt securities, preferred and common stock and other securities. In October 2006, AIG established a medium term note program under its shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to $25.1 billion of AIG debt securities. The proceeds from the issuance of these debt securities may be used (i) by AIG for general corporate purposes, (ii) by AIGFP as it would use the proceeds from its own borrowings as discussed below or (iii) to fund the MIP. As of December 31, 2006, $1.8 billion principal amount of notes were outstanding under the medium term note program, of which (i) $749 million was used for AIGs general corporate purposes, (ii) $72 million was used by AIGFP and (iii) $1.0 billion was used to fund the MIP. The maturity dates of these notes range from 2011 to 2046. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes. AIG also maintains a Euro medium term note program under which an aggregate nominal amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. As of December 31, 2006, the equivalent of $5.7 billion of notes were outstanding under the program, of which $3.7 billion were used to fund the MIP and the remainder was used for AIGs general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount outstanding includes $249 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars, of which $151 million relates to notes issued by AIG for general corporate purposes and $98 million relates to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG has hedged the currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated notes by effectively economically hedging that exposure, although such hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. In 2007, through February 15, AIG issued the equivalent of $194 million under the Euro program to fund the MIP. In 2006, AIG issued in Rule 144A/Regulation S offerings $3 billion principal amount of senior notes, of which $1.0 billion was exchanged by AIG for substantially identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act. The proceeds from the sale of $2.25 billion of these notes were used for AIGs general corporate purposes and $750 million was used to fund the MIP. In 2007, through February 15, AIG issued in Rule 144A offerings an aggregate of $750 million principal amount of senior notes, of which $500 million was used to fund the MIP and $250 million was used for AIGs general corporate purposes. In November 2006, AIG filed a shelf registration statement in Japan, providing for the issuance of up to Japanese Yen 300 billion principal amount of senior notes. In December 2006, AIG issued the equivalent of $429 million under the Japanese shelf registration statement, the proceeds of which were used for AIGs general corporate purposes. In November 2006, AIG established an Australian dollar debt program under which senior notes with an aggregate amount of up to 5 billion Australian dollars may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. Although as of December 31, 2006 there were no outstanding notes under the Australian program, AIG intends to use the program opportunistically to fund the MIP or for AIGs general corporate purposes. In March 2006, AIG borrowed a total of $1.3 billion on an unsecured basis pursuant to loan agreements with third party banks, of which $700 million remained outstanding on Decem 70 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries ber 31, 2006; $500 million was repaid in February 2007, and the balance matures in March 2007. AIGFP AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFPs notes and bonds include structured debt instruments whose payment terms are linked to one or more financial or other indices (such as an equity index or commodity index or another measure that is not considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt instrument). These notes contain embedded derivatives that otherwise would be required to be accounted for separately under FAS 133. Upon AIGs early adoption of FAS 155, AIGFP elected the fair value option for these notes. The notes that are accounted for using the fair value option are reported separately under hybrid financial instrument liabilities. AIG guarantees the obligations of AIGFP under AIGFPs notes and bonds and GIA borrowings. See Operating Review Financial Services Operations, Liquidity and Derivatives herein. In June 2006, AIGFP sold an aggregate of $2.0 billion principal amount of senior, floating rate notes in Rule 144A offerings, of which $1.0 billion matures in 2007 and $1.0 billion matures in 2008. AIGFP also has a Euro medium term note program under which an aggregate nominal amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. As of December 31, 2006, $5.66 billion of notes were outstanding under the program, including $575 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars. AIGFPs Rule 144A Notes and the notes issued under this program are guaranteed by AIG and are included in AIGFPs Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. AIG Funding AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), issues commercial paper that is guaranteed by AIG in order to help fulfill the short term cash requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. The issuance of AIG Fundings commercial paper, including the guarantee by AIG, is subject to the approval of AIGs Board of Directors or the Finance Committee of the Board if it exceeds certain pre approved limits. As backup for the commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes, AIG and AIG Funding maintain revolving credit facilities, which, as of December 31, 2006, had an aggregate of $5.8 billion available to be drawn and which are summarized below under Revolving Credit Facilities. ILFC ILFC fulfills its short term cash requirements through operating cash flows and the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of ILFCs Board of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. ILFC maintains syndicated revolving credit facilities which, as of December 31, 2006, aggregated $6.5 billion and which are summarized below under Revolving Credit Facilities. These facilities are used as back up for ILFCs maturing debt and other obligations. As a well known seasoned issuer, ILFC has filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC allowing ILFC immediate access to the U.S. public debt markets. For 2006, $1.90 billion of debt securities were issued under this registration statement and $3.52 billion were issued under a prior registration statement. In addition, ILFC has a Euro medium term note program for $7.0 billion, under which $4.28 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2006. Notes issued under the Euro medium term note program are included in ILFC Notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings. The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign currency denominated debt was $733 million at December 31, 2006 and $197 million at December 31, 2005. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated notes by economically hedging the portion of the note exposure not already offset by Euro denominated operating lease payments, although such hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing ten year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2006, ILFC had $1.0 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured Export Credit Facility for up to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2005. The facility was subsequently increased to $3.64 billion and extended to include aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2007. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a six month forward looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. At December 31, 2006, ILFC had $1.7 billion outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFCs Notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings. From time to time, ILFC enters into funded financing agreements. As of December 31, 2006, ILFC had a total of $1.2 billion outstanding, which has varying maturities through February 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR based, with spreads ranging from 0.30 percent to 1.625 percent. In December of 2005, ILFC issued two tranches of junior subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion to underlie trust preferred securities issued by a trust sponsored by ILFC. Both tranches mature on December 21, 2065, but each tranche has a different call option. The $600 million tranche has a call date of December 21, 2010 and the $400 million tranche has a call date of December 21, 2015. The tranche with the 2010 call date has a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent for the first five years. The tranche with the 2015 call date has a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent for the first ten years. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 71 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Both tranches have interest rate adjustments if the call option is not exercised. If the call option is not exercised, the new interest rate will be a floating quarterly reset rate based on the initial credit spread plus the highest of (i) 3 month LIBOR, (ii) 10 year constant maturity treasury and (iii) 30 year constant maturity treasury. The proceeds of ILFCs debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. AIG does not guarantee the debt obligations of ILFC. See also Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Liquidity herein. AGF AGF fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of AGFs Board of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. AGF maintains committed syndicated revolving credit facilities which, as of December 31, 2006, aggregated to $4.25 billion and which are summarized below under Revolving Credit Facilities. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and to provide backup for AGFs commercial paper programs. AGF issued $3.62 billion during 2006 and $5.51 billion during 2005 of notes and bonds ranging in maturities from two to 25 years. As of December 31, 2006, notes and bonds aggregating $19.59 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2007 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 1.94 percent to 8.45 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes and bonds. As a well known seasoned issuer, AGF has filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC allowing AGF immediate access to the U.S. public debt markets. At December 31, 2006, AGF had the corporate authority to issue up to $13.4 billion of debt securities under its shelf registration statements. In January 2007, AGF issued junior subordinated debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million that mature in January 2067. The debentures underlie a series of trust preferred securities sold by a trust sponsored by AGF in a Rule 144A/Regulation S offering. AGF can redeem the debentures at par beginning in January 2017 and until that time will pay a fixed rate of interest. If AGF does not redeem the debentures in January 2017, the interest rate changes to a floating rate, which will reset based on 3 month LIBOR. AGFs funding sources include a medium term note program, private placement debt, retail note issuances, securitizations of finance receivables that AGF accounts for as on balance sheet secured financings and bank financings. In addition, AGF has become an established issuer of long term debt in the international capital markets. In addition to debt refinancing activities, proceeds from the collection of finance receivables may be used to pay the principal and interest on AGFs debt. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF. See also Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Liquidity herein. AIGCFG AIGCFG has a variety of funding mechanisms for its various markets, including: retail and wholesale deposits; short term and long term bank loans and intercompany subordinated debt. AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan), a consumer finance business in Taiwan, has issued commercial paper for the funding of its own operations. AIG does not guarantee any borrowings for AIGCFG businesses, including this commercial paper. 72 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Revolving Credit Facilities AIG, ILFC and AGF maintain the following committed, unsecured revolving credit facilities in order to support their respective commercial paper programs and for general corporate purposes.

Rating triggers generally relate to events which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. AIG believes that any of its own or its subsidiaries contractual obligations that are subject to ratings triggers or financial covenants relating to ratings triggers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or liquidity. Ratings downgrades could also trigger the application of termination provisions in certain of AIGs contracts, principally agreements entered into by AIGFP and assumed reinsurance contracts entered into by Transatlantic. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on February 15, 2007, based on AIGFPs outstanding municipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a downgrade of AIGs long term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moodys or AA by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $864 million of collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIGFP manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the fair value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. Additional obligations to post collateral would increase the demand on AIGFPs liquidity. 74 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The maturity schedule of contractual obligations of AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 was as follows: Payments due by Period Total Less Than 1 3 3+ 5 Over (in millions) Payments One Year Years Years Five Years Borrowings(a) $ 133,285 $ 34,670 $ 29,949 $ 30,483 $ 38,183 Interest payments on borrowings 44,090 4,960 8,130 5,445 25,555 Loss reserves(b) 79,999 22,000 24,399 11,600 22,000 Insurance and investment contract liabilities (c) 577,730 16,023 27,728 39,376 494,603 GIC liabilities(d) 56,042 19,399 23,209 3,889 9,545 Aircraft purchase commitments 19,042 5,442 7,079 2,155 4,366 Operating leases 2,763 626 802 581 754 Total $ 912,951 $ 103,120 $ 121,296 $ 93,529 $ 595,006 (a) Excludes commercial paper and obligations included as debt pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), and includes hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. (c) Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) the occurrence of a payment due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of AIGs control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits which include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premium on in force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the balance sheet. (d) Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs. The maturity schedule of other commercial commitments of AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 was as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Total Amounts Less Than 1 3 3+ 5 Over Committed One Year Years Years Five Years Letters of credit: Life Insurance & Retirement Services $ 185 $ 21 $ 28 $ $ 136 Parent Company(a) 641 522 1 118 DBG 198 198 Standby letters of credit: Capital Markets 1,739 1,427 104 40 168 Guarantees: Life Insurance & Retirement Services(b) 2,100 113 423 7 1,557 Aircraft Leasing 161 52 109 Asset Management 246 23 53 170 Other commercial commitments(c): Capital Markets(d) 15,946 5,127 2,313 2,640 5,866 Aircraft Leasing(e) 344 344 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(f) 4,896 1,119 1,730 1,177 870 Asset Management(g) 1,310 896 255 91 68 Life Settlement 203 203 DBG(h) 1,588 690 603 295 Parent Company 193 56 137 Total $ 29,750 $ 10,192 $ 5,902 $ 4,368 $ 9,288 (a) Represents reimbursement obligations under letters of credit issued by commercial banks.

Form 10 K 2006 AIG 75 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements AIG transacts with special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the ordinary course of business. Many of these SPVs are included in the consolidated financial statements but some are off balance sheet. AIG has guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. In addition, AIG has expanded the responsibility of its Complex Structured Financial Transaction Committee (CSFT) to include the review of any transaction that could subject AIG to heightened legal, reputational, regulatory, accounting or other risk. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting for a further discussion of the CSFT. For additional information related to AIGs activities with respect to VIEs and certain guarantees, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Shareholders Equity AIGs consolidated shareholders equity increased during 2006 and 2005 as follows: (in millions) 2006 2005 Beginning of year $ 86,317 $ 79,673 Net income 14,048 10,477 Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments, net of tax 1,735 (1,978 ) Cumulative translation adjustment, net of tax 936 (540 ) Dividends to shareholders (1,690 ) (1,615 ) Other* 331 300 End of year $ 101,677 $ 86,317 * Reflects the effects of employee stock transactions and in 2006 also reflects the cumulative effect of accounting changes, including the adoption of FAS 158. See Note 1(hh) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. In February 2007, AIGs Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy, to take effect with the dividend to be declared in the second quarter of 2007, providing that under ordinary circumstances, AIGs plan will be to increase its common stock dividend by approximately 20 percent annually. Share Repurchases During 2006, AIG did not purchase any shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2006, an additional 36,542,700 shares could be purchased under the then current authorization by AIGs Board of Directors. In February 2007, AIGs Board of Directors increased the repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase of shares with an aggregate purchase price of $8 billion. AIG or its subsidiaries from time to time may buy shares of its common stock in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. During 2006, ILFC purchased 17,000 shares of AIG common stock at an average cost of $72.18 per share to satisfy its obligations under an employee benefit plan. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity for a discussion of possible share repurchases in 2007. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIGs domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of AIGs foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. The most significant foreign insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Singapore. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 90 percent of consolidated shareholders equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2006. See Regulation and Supervision herein. AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG company is currently on any regulatory or similar watch list with regard to solvency. See also Liquidity herein, Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors Liquidity. Regulation and Supervision AIGs insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S., the NAIC has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. In preparing both its 2004 and 2005 audited statutory financial statements for its Domestic General Insurance companies, AIG agreed with the relevant state regulatory authorities on the statutory accounting treatment of the various items requiring adjustment or restatement. With respect to the 2004 audited statutory financial statements, these adjustments and restatements reduced previously reported General Insurance statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 by approximately $3.5 billion, to approximately $20.6 billion. With respect to the 2005 audited statutory financial statements, the state regulators permitted the Domestic General Insurance companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005. AIGs insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or 76 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non admitted. In connection with the filing of the 2005 statutory financial statements for AIGs Domestic General Insurance companies, AIG agreed with the relevant state insurance regulators on the statutory accounting treatment of various items. The regulatory authorities have also permitted certain of the domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries to support the carrying value of their investments in certain non insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries by utilizing the AIG audited consolidated financial statements to satisfy the requirement that the U.S. GAAP basis equity of such entities be audited. In addition, the regulatory authorities have permitted the Domestic General Insurance companies to utilize audited financial statements prepared on a basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP to value investments in joint ventures, limited partnerships and hedge funds. AIG has received similar permitted practices authorizations from insurance regulatory authorities in connection with the 2006 statutory financial statements. These permitted practices did not affect the Domestic General Insurance companies compliance with minimum regulatory capital requirements. Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum company action level requirements following the adjustments, but AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005 and contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005. To enhance their current capital positions, AIG suspended dividends from the DBG companies from the fourth quarter 2005 through 2006, but AIG expects dividend payments will resume in the first quarter of 2007. AIG believes it has the capital resources and liquidity to fund any necessary statutory capital contributions. As discussed above, various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices. In addition, the OTS and other regulators routinely conduct examinations of AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIGs consumer finance operations. AIG cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations and examinations, or any additional regulation arising therefrom, might have on its business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIGs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses, and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. AIGs U.S. operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were $97 million, $124 million and $118 million. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. A substantial portion of AIGs General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. Foreign insurance operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIGs financial condition or results of operations. Liquidity AIG manages liquidity at both the subsidiary and parent company levels. At December 31, 2006, AIGs consolidated invested assets, primarily held by its subsidiaries, included $26.8 billion in cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2006 amounted to $6.8 billion. At the parent company level, liquidity management activities are conducted in a manner to preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and diversity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions. AIGs primary sources of cash flow are dividends and other payments from its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as issuances of debt securities. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, subsidiary funding and shareholder dividend payments. Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet its anticipated cash requirements, including the funding of increased Form 10 K 2006 AIG 77 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued dividends under AIGs new dividend policy and repurchases of common stock. Insurance Operations The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. Cash flow from underwriting operations includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders contract deposits, and paid loss recoveries, less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. Investment cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. In addition to the combined insurance operating cash flow, AIGs insurance operations held $11.2 billion in cash and short term investments at December 31, 2006. Operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided AIGs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $126 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $161 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2006. See also Operating Review General Insurance Operations General Insurance Net Investment Income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations Life Insurance & Retirement Services Net Investment Income and Realized Capital Gains (Losses) herein. General Insurance General Insurance operating cash flow is derived from underwriting and investment activities. With respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIGs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments liquidated to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating cash flow is derived from underwriting and investment activities. If a substantial portion of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted, AIG might need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolio and or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts, or other economic or political upheaval. In addition, a significant rise in interest rates leading to a major increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain. Financial Services AIGs major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFPs operations include GIAs, issuance of long term and short term debt, proceeds from maturities, sales of securities available for sale and securities and spot commodities leased or sold under repurchase agreements. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG utilize the commercial paper markets, bank loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. ILFC and AGF also fund in the domestic and international capital markets without reliance on any guarantee from AIG. An additional source of liquidity for ILFC is the use of export credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds. On occasion, AIG has provided equity capital to ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG and provides intercompany loans to AIGCFG. Asset Management Asset Management operating cash flow is derived primarily from investment income in connection with domestic and foreign GICs and from the collection of various forms of investment management fees, brokerage commissions and custody fees earned from affiliated and unaffiliated clients. Investment management fees are typically asset based fees collected on a periodic basis, while brokerage commissions and custody fees are more transaction driven and received on a continual basis. Asset Management also derives cash from the realization of gains earned through its investment partnership holdings and collects various forms of incentive management fees. These incentive management fees, which are typically based on the appreciation and or realization of gains on managed assets, are generally received in the form of carried interest earned from sponsored funds managed on behalf of clients. Asset Managements spread based investment business derives cash from the investment income and the sale of invested assets backing these contract liabilities. AIGGIG incurs expenses with associated cash outflows from the operation of its business, including costs related to portfolio management and related back and middle office costs. In addition, cash is used in association with investment warehousing activities wherein AIGGIG funds and holds an investment for the benefit of a future investment vehicle. Cash needs for the spread based investment business are principally the result of GIC maturities. Significant blocks of the GIC portfolio will mature over the next five years. AIG utilizes asset liability matching to control liquidity risks associated with 78 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries this business. In addition, AIG believes that its products incorporate certain restrictions which encourage persistency, limiting the magnitude of unforeseen surrenders in the GIC portfolio. Liquidity for Asset Management operations can be affected by significant credit or geopolitical events that might cause a delay in fund closings, securitizations or an inability of AIGs clients to fund their capital commitments. AIGGIG has relied upon AIG from time to time in order to fund certain liquidity requirements associated with investment warehousing. In addition, AIG Global Real Estate maintains several external credit lines in order to fund its ongoing property development and construction related activities. AIG (Parent Company) The liquidity of the parent company is principally derived from its subsidiaries. The primary sources of cash flow are dividends and other payments from its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as issuance of debt securities. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, subsidiary funding, shareholder dividend payments and purchases of outstanding shares of common stock. In 2006, AIG Parent collected $2.1 billion in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries and issued $6.6 billion in debt securities excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. AIG Parent also made interest payments totaling $232 million, made $2.9 billion in capital contributions to subsidiaries (principally $2.3 billion to DBG), and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2006. No share repurchases were made by AIG Parent in 2006. AIG funds its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of December 31, 2006, AIG Funding had $4.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 28 days. As additional liquidity, AIG and AIG Funding maintain revolving credit facilities that, as of December 31, 2006, had an aggregate of $5.8 billion available to be drawn, which are summarized above under Revolving Credit Facilities. At the parent company level, liquidity management activities are conducted in a manner intended to preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and diversity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions. Assessing liquidity risk involves forecasting of cash inflows/outflows on both a short and long term basis. Corporate Treasury is responsible for formulating the parent companys liquidity and contingency planning efforts, as well as for execution of AIGs specific funding activities. Through active liquidity management, AIG seeks to retain stable, reliable and cost effective funding sources. In addition to current liquidity requirements, factors which affect funding decisions include market conditions, prevailing interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities. The objectives of contingency planning are to ensure maintenance of appropriate liquidity during normal and stress periods, to measure and project funding requirements during periods of stress, and to manage access to funding sources. Diversification of funding sources is an important element of AIGs liquidity risk management approach. AIGs liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or AIG. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIGs ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIGs subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder AIGs ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations. Because of the wide geographic profile of AIGs regulated subsidiaries, management believes that these cash flows represent a diversified source of liquidity for AIG. For a further discussion of the regulatory environment in which AIG subsidiaries operate and other issues affecting AIGs liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Invested Assets AIGs investment strategy is to invest primarily in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and or country concentrations.

General Insurance Invested Assets In AIGs General Insurance business, the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than other lines. As differentiated from the Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies, the focus is not on asset liability matching, but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus. Fixed income holdings of the Domestic General Insurance companies are comprised primarily of tax exempt securities, which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns. These high quality municipal investments have an average rating of high AA. Fixed income assets held in Foreign General Insurance are of high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4.2 years compared to 7.2 years for those in Domestic General Insurance. While reserves are invested in conventional fixed income securities in Domestic General Insurance, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to large capitalization, high dividend, public equity strategies and to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns. General Insurance invested assets grew by $21.3 billion, or 22 percent, during 2006 as bond holdings grew by $17 billion, or 24 percent. Listed equity holdings remained essentially flat at $6.5 billion. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Invested Assets With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services, AIGs investment strategy is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations, as it has been doing throughout AIGs history, even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions. For example, in several Southeast Asian countries, the duration of investments is shorter than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at Form 10 K 2006 AIG 81 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. In 2006, new money investment rates generally increased in the U.S., Japan and Taiwan, and were generally unchanged in Thailand. In regard to in force business, management focus is required in both the investment and product management process to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business. In some countries, new products are being introduced with minimal investment guarantees resulting in a shift toward investment linked savings products and away from traditional savings products with higher guarantees. The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. AIG may use alternative investments in certain foreign jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are limited long dated bond markets, including equities, real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability. This strategy has been effectively used in Japan and more recently by Nan Shan in Taiwan. In Japan, foreign assets, excluding those matched to foreign liabilities, were approximately 30 percent of statutory assets, which is below the maximum allowable percentage under current local regulation. Foreign assets comprised approximately 32 percent of Nan Shans invested assets at December 31, 2006, slightly below the maximum allowable percentage under current local regulation. The majority of Nan Shans in force policy portfolio is traditional life and endowment insurance products with implicit interest rate guarantees. New business with lower interest rate guarantees are gradually reducing the overall interest requirements, but asset portfolio yields have declined faster due to the prolonged low interest rate environment. As a result, although the investment margins for a large block of in force policies are negative, the block remains profitable because the mortality and expense margins presently exceed the negative investment spread. In response to the low interest rate environment and the volatile exchange rate of the NT dollar, Nan Shan is emphasizing new products with lower implied guarantees, including participating endowments and investment linked products. Although the risks of a continued low interest rate environment coupled with a volatile NT dollar could increase net liabilities and require additional capital to maintain adequate local solvency margins, Nan Shan currently believes it has adequate resources to meet all future policy obligations. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed through the availability of qualified long term investments. A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits or guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products. AIG manages its exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Available for sale bonds and equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments, net of taxes, as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines that are determined to be other than temporary are reflected in income in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer exists. See Valuation of Invested Assets herein. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users to hedge their exposures. For a further discussion of AIGs use of derivatives, see Risk Management Credit Risk Management Derivatives herein. In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. For a discussion of these restrictions, see Item 1. Business Regulation. Life Insurance & Retirement Services invested assets grew by $37.0 billion, or 10 percent, during 2006 as bond holdings grew by $15.1 billion, or 6 percent, and listed equity holdings grew by $6.7 billion, or 41 percent. For a discussion of credit risk exposures, see Risk Management Credit Risk Management herein. Financial Services Invested Assets ILFC The cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFCs debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the related interest expense are ILFCs cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2006, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $6.0 billion. For a further discussion of ILFCs borrowings, see Operating Review Financial Services Operations Aircraft Leasing and Capital Resources Borrowings herein. At December 31, 2006, ILFC had committed to purchase 254 new aircraft deliverable from 2007 through 2015 for an estimated aggregate purchase price of $19.0 billion. As of February 22, 2007, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2007, and 64 of 171 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2007. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft currently on order and any aircraft to be 82 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. Capital Markets Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions would be exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to AIGs financial condition or its overall liquidity. For a further discussion on the use of derivatives by Capital Markets, see Operating Review Financial Services Operations Capital Markets and Risk Management Derivatives herein and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIAs to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell are used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings, or invest in new assets. For a further discussion of AIGFPs borrowings, see Capital Resources Borrowings herein. Securities available for sale is predominately a diversified portfolio of high grade fixed income securities, where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2006, the average credit rating of this portfolio was in the AA+ category or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with $128 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2006 amounted to approximately $340 million in fair value, representing 0.7 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have been no significant downgrades through February 15, 2007. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs payment obligations, including its debt obligations. AIGFPs exposure management objective is to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security, which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting treatment was not achieved in 2006, the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties were reflected in operating income. The unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities available for sale resulting from changes in interest rates and currency rates and commodity and equity prices were included in Accumulated other comprehensive income, or in operating income, as appropriate. When a security is sold, the realized gain or loss with respect to this security is then included in operating income. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP owns inventories in certain commodities in which it trades, and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. Physical commodities held in AIGFPs wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary are recorded at fair value. All other commodities are recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Trading securities, at fair value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at fair value, are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are purchased and sold as necessary to meet the risk management objectives of Capital Markets operations. The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Gross Gross Unrealized Unrealized (in millions) Gains Losses Securities available for sale, at fair value(a) $ 1,575 $ 282 Unrealized gain/loss on swaps, options and forward transactions(b) 19,252 11,401 (a) See Note 8(i) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets operations. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to monitor on an ongoing basis the various financial market, operational and credit risks attendant to the Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIGFP actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportu Form 10 K 2006 AIG 83 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued nities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a variety of exposures, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Consumer Finance AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate and other consumer loans, credit card loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers both domestically and overseas, particularly in emerging markets. These products are funded through a combination of deposits and various borrowings, including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the finance receivables are real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Asset Management Invested Assets Asset Management invested assets are primarily comprised of assets supporting AIGs spread based investment business, which includes AIGs MIP and domestic GIC programs as well as AIGs foreign spread based business. Asset Management invested assets also include assets attributable to certain consolidated partnerships and variable interest entities. A portion of these consolidated assets is offset by minority interest liabilities attributable to unaffiliated investor entities in AIG sponsored investment vehicles. The spread based investment business strategy is to produce cash flows greater than maturing liabilities. The asset liability relationship is managed actively, leveraging the organizations experience in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment. Margins are emphasized while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. The invested assets are predominantly fixed income securities for the spread based investment business. Asset Management invested assets grew by $14.3 billion, or 20 percent during 2006, although aggregate Asset Management fixed income investments remained essentially flat at $37.7 billion. The growth in invested assets was primarily attributable to increases in short term investments, securities lending collateral and real estate investments. These increases were primarily driven by continued growth of the MIP and AIGs foreign spread based business, and the growth of AIGs institutional Asset Management business. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in assets associated with the runoff of the domestic GIC program. Valuation of Invested Assets AIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. Therefore, the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of AIGs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale. Traded Securities The valuation of AIGs investment portfolio involves obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the fair value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, and hedge funds. Nontraded Securities The aggregate carrying value of AIGs nontraded securities at December 31, 2006 was approximately $67 billion. The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This methodology takes into account such factors as the issuers industry, the securitys rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, or less than a five percent interest but where AIG has more than a minor influence over the operations of the investee, AIG accounts for these investments using the equity method. The changes in such net asset values are included in operating income. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. Each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination. 84 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Portfolio Review AIG periodically evaluates its securities for other than temporary impairments in valuation. As a matter of policy, the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of AIGs management and a continual review of its investments. See Note 1(e) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on AIGs policy. Once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings. As a result of these policies, AIG recorded, in realized capital gains (losses), other than temporary impairment pretax losses of $944 million, $598 million and $684 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Just over half of other than temporary impairment charges in 2006 were a result of the decision not to hold these investment securities until they fully recover in value. The writedowns recorded in 2005 and 2004 were primarily the result of adverse changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer. No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1.0 percent of consolidated net income for 2006. Excluding the other than temporary impairments noted above, the changes in fair value for AIGs available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIGs investments, were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax. At December 31, 2006, aggregate pretax unrealized gains were $17.5 billion, while the pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds, non investment grade bonds and equity securities were $3.6 billion, $134 million and $159 million, respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the fair value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items, was as follows: Greater than 20% to Greater than 50% Less than or equal to 50% of Cost(a) of Cost(a) 20% of Cost(a) Total Aging Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized (dollars in millions) Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss(b) Items Investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 28,869 $ 376 3,941 $ 74 $ 17 9 $ $ $ 28,943 $ 393 3,950 7 12 months 37,835 777 4,876 37,835 777 4,876 12 months 82,945 2,377 10,640 10 4 5 82,955 2,381 10,645 Total $ 149,649 $ 3,530 19,457 $ 84 $ 21 14 $ $ $ 149,733 $ 3,551 19,471 Below investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 1,828 $ 56 341 $ 3 $ 1 5 $ 1 $ 1 4 $ 1,832 $ 58 350 7 12 months 1,043 28 146 3 1 4 1,046 29 150 12 months 1,085 47 201 1,085 47 201 Total $ 3,956 $ 131 688 $ 6 $ 2 9 $ 1 $ 1 4 $ 3,963 $ 134 701 Total bonds 0 6 months $ 30,697 $ 432 4,282 $ 77 $ 18 14 $ 1 $ 1 4 $ 30,775 $ 451 4,300 7 12 months 38,878 805 5,022 3 1 4 38,881 806 5,026 12 months 84,030 2,424 10,841 10 4 5 84,040 2,428 10,846 Total $ 153,605 $ 3,661 20,145 $ 90 $ 23 23 $ 1 $ 1 4 $ 153,696 $ 3,685 20,172 Equity securities 0 6 months $ 2,042 $ 86 1,309 $ 68 $ 20 54 $ 1 $ 3 $ 2,111 $ 106 1,366 7 12 months 566 36 309 56 16 72 1 1 3 623 53 384 12 months Total $ 2,608 $ 122 1,618 $ 124 $ 36 126 $ 2 $ 1 6 $ 2,734 $ 159 1,750 (a) For bonds, represents amortized cost.

Form 10 K 2006 AIG 85 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued At December 31, 2006, the fair value of AIGs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated $496.0 billion. At December 31, 2006, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes for fixed maturity and equity securities were $11.4 billion. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity and equity securities were approximately $2.5 billion. The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. At December 31, 2006, unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations. The amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2006, by contractual maturity, is shown below: (in millions) Amortized Cost Due in one year or less $ 6,139 Due after one year through five years 31,839 Due after five years through ten years 51,084 Due after ten years 64,634 Total $ 153,696 For the year ended December 31, 2006, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $1.3 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $43 billion, which was approximately 97 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2006 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately four months. See Risk Management Investments herein for an additional discussion of investment risks associated with AIGs investment portfolio. Risk Management Overview AIG believes that strong risk management practices and a sound internal control environment are fundamental to its continued success and profitable growth. Failure to manage risk properly could expose AIG to significant losses, regulatory issues and a damaged reputation. The major risks to which AIG is exposed include the following: Insurance risk the potential loss resulting from ultimate claims and expenses exceeding held reserves. Credit risk the potential loss arising from an obligors inability or unwillingness to meet its obligations to AIG. Market risk the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity and commodity prices, and their levels of volatility. Operational risk the potential loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. AIG senior management establishes the framework, principles and guidelines for risk management. The business executives are responsible for establishing and implementing risk management processes and responding to the individual needs and issues within their business, including risk concentrations within their business segments. Corporate Risk Management AIGs major risks are addressed at the corporate level through the Enterprise Risk Management Department (ERM). ERM is headed by AIGs Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and is responsible for assisting AIGs business leaders, executive management and the Board of Directors to identify, assess, quantify, manage and mitigate the risks incurred by AIG. An important goal of ERM is to ensure that once appropriate governance, authorities, procedures and policies have been established, aggregated risks do not result in inappropriate concentrations. Senior management defines the policies, has established general operating parameters for its global businesses and has established various oversight committees to monitor the risks attendant to its businesses: The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) is responsible for (i) approving credit risk policies and procedures for use throughout AIG; (ii) delegating credit authority to business unit credit officers and select business unit managers; (iii) approving transaction requests and limits for corporate, sovereign and cross border credit exposures that exceed the delegated authorities; (iv) establishing and maintaining AIGs risk rating process for corporate, financial and sovereign obligors; and (v) regular reviews of credit risk exposures in the portfolios of all credit incurring business units. The Financial Risk Committee (FRC) oversees AIGs market risk exposures to interest rates, foreign exchange and equity prices and provides strategic direction for AIGs asset liability management. The FRC meets monthly and acts as a central mechanism for AIG senior management to review comprehensive information on AIGs financial exposures and to exercise broad control over these exposures. The Foreign Exchange Committee (FEC) monitors trends in foreign exchange rates, reviews AIGs foreign exchange exposures, and provides recommendations on foreign currency asset allocation and remittance hedging. The Derivatives Review Committee (DRC) provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program not otherwise managed by AIGFP. The DRC examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. The Complex Structured Finance Transaction Committee (CSFTC) has the authority and responsibility to review and approve proposed transactions that could subject AIG to heightened legal, reputational, accounting, or regulatory risk (CSFTs). The CSFTC provides guidance to and monitors the activities of transaction review committees (TRCs) which have been established in all major business units. TRCs have the responsibility to identify, review and refer CSFTs to the CSFTC. 86 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Credit Risk Management Credit risk is one of AIGs largest single business risks and AIG devotes considerable resources, expertise and controls to managing its credit exposures. Credit risk is defined as the risk that AIGs customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they come due. Credit risk may also be manifested: (i) through the downgrading of credit ratings of counterparties whose credit instruments AIG may be holding, or, in some cases, insuring, causing the value of the assets to decline or insured risks to rise and (ii) as cross border risk where a country (sovereign government risk) or one or more non sovereign obligors within a country are unable to repay an obligation or are unable to provide foreign exchange to service a credit or equity exposure incurred by another AIG business unit located outside that country. AIGs credit risks are managed at the corporate level by the Credit Risk Management Department (CRM) whose primary role is to support and supplement the work of the CRC. CRM is headed by AIGs Chief Credit Officer (CCO), who reports to AIGs CRO. AIGs CCO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of credit risk policies and procedures approved by the CRC. In discharging this function CRM has the following responsibilities: Manage the approval process for all requests for credit limits, program limits and transactions. Approve delegated credit authorities to CRM credit executives and business unit credit officers. Aggregate globally all credit exposure data by counterparty, country and industry and report risk concentrations regularly to the CRC. Administer regular portfolio credit reviews of all investment, derivative and credit incurring business units. Develop methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of AIGs internal risk rating process. Approve appropriate credit reserves and methodologies at the business unit and enterprise levels. AIG closely monitors and controls its company wide credit risk concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require collateral, guarantees and or reinsurance support such as letters of credit. AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, derivatives (mark to market), deposits (in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. The following table presents AIGs largest credit exposures at December 31, 2006 as a percentage of total shareholders equity. Credit Exposure as a percentage of Total Category Risk Rating(a) Shareholders Equity Investment Grade: 10 largest combined AA (weighted average ) (b) 73.5% Single largest non sovereign (financial institution) AA 7.4 Single largest corporate AAA 5.6 Single largest sovereign AA 14.3 Non Investment Grade: Single largest sovereign BB 1.4 Single largest non sovereign BB 0.6 (a) Risk rating is based on external ratings, or equivalent, based on AIGs internal risk rating process. (b) Six are highly rated financial institutions and three are investment grade rated sovereigns; none is rated lower than BBB+ or its equivalent. AIG closely controls its aggregate cross border exposures to avoid excessive concentrations in any one country or regional group of countries. AIG defines its cross border exposure to include both cross border credit exposures and its large cross border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries had cross border exposures in excess of 10 percent of total shareholders equity; seven are AAA rated and two are AA rated. In addition, AIG closely monitors its industry concentrations, the risks of which are often mitigated by the breadth and scope of AIGs international operations. AIGs single largest industry credit exposure is to the highly rated global financial institutions sector, accounting for 72 percent of total shareholders equity at December 31, 2006. AIGs other industry credit concentrations in excess of 10 percent of total shareholders equity at December 31, 2006 exist to the following industries (in descending order by approximate size): global telecommunications companies; U.S. residential mortgages; global life insurance carriers; U.S. based regional financial institutions; U.S. commercial mortgages; global reinsurance firms; and global securities firms. The CRC reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. The CRC may adjust limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIGs credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 87 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Market Risk Management AIG seeks to minimize market risks by matching the market risks in its assets with the market risks in its liabilities. Nevertheless, AIG does have net exposure to market risks, primarily within its insurance businesses. These asset liability exposures are predominantly structural in nature, and not the result of speculative positioning to take advantage of short term market opportunities. The Market Risk Management Department (MRM), which reports to the CRO, is responsible for control and oversight of market risks in all aspects of AIGs financial services, insurance, and investment activities. AIGs market exposures arise from the following: AIG is a globally diversified enterprise with capital deployed in a variety of currencies. Capital deployed in AIGs overseas businesses, when converted into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, constitutes a long foreign currency/short U.S. dollar market exposure on AIGs balance sheet. Similarly, overseas earnings denominated in foreign currency also represent a long foreign currency/short U.S. dollar market exposure on AIGs income statement. Much of AIGs domestic capital is invested in fixed income or equity securities, leading to exposures to U.S. yields and equity markets. Several of AIGs Foreign Life subsidiaries operate in developing markets where maturities on longer term life insurance liabilities exceed the maximum maturities of available local currency assets. AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. VaR measures not only the size of individual exposures but also the interaction between different market exposures, thereby providing a portfolio approach to measuring market risk. Substantially similar VaR methodologies are used to determine capital requirements for market risk within AIGs economic capital framework. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, their results are limited by the assumptions and parameters used in these models. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. Insurance, Asset Management and Non Trading Financial Services VaR AIG has performed one comprehensive VaR analysis across all of its non trading businesses, and a separate VaR analysis for its trading business at AIGFP. The comprehensive VaR is categorized by AIG business segment (General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management) and also by market risk factor (interest rate, currency and equity). For the insurance segments, assets included are invested assets (excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued), and liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds. For financial services companies, loans and leases represent the majority of assets represented in the VaR calculation, while bonds and notes issued represent the majority of liabilities. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to net fair values as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The VaR number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure) within a one month holding period. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each scenario, each transaction was repriced. Segment and AIG wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. 88 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the year end, average, high and low VaRs on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs non trading investments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The diversified VaR is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects.

Two factors contributed to the decline in total VaR. A reduction in interest rate volatility in many currencies moderated AIGs interest rate risk profile, and higher correlations between the long asset duration exposure in U.S. fixed income and long liability duration exposures in many emerging markets provided a greater diversification benefit during 2006. Lower VaR figures in both the Financial Services and Asset Management segments during 2006 were the result of a combination of closer duration matching and a reduction of interest rate volatility. Operational Risk Management AIG has established a corporate level Operational Risk Management Department (ORM) to oversee AIGs operational risk management practices. The Director of ORM reports to the CRO. ORM is responsible for establishing the framework, principles and guidelines for operational risk management. This framework also utilizes the risk management efforts of AIGs compliance, legal and regulatory and internal audit functions. ORM also manages compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Each business is responsible for implementing the components of AIGs operational risk management program to ensure that effective operational risk management practices are utilized throughout AIG. These components include governance, risk and control self assessment, risk event data analysis, and key risk indicators. The program currently incorporates the following: Governance Strong governance sets the appropriate tone to enable effective management of the risks inherent in each of AIGs businesses, as well as aid in the management of reputational risk. Each AIG business is responsible for maintaining appropriate governance over its management of operational risk. This respon Form 10 K 2006 AIG 89 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued sibility includes developing and implementing policies, procedures, management oversight processes, and other governance related activities consistent with AIGs overall operational risk management process. Risk and Control Self Assessment AIGs operational risk management program includes a self assessment process. The self assessment process is used to identify key operational risks in a business and evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls to mitigate those risks, as well as develop corrective action plans for identified deficiencies. Insurance Risk Management Reinsurance AIG uses reinsurance programs for its general insurance risks as follows: (i) facultative to cover large individual exposures; (ii) quota share treaties to cover specific books of business; (iii) excess of loss treaties to cover large losses; and (iv) catastrophe treaties to cover certain catastrophes including earthquake, flood, wind and terror. AIGs Reinsurance Security Department conducts periodic detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments may include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity, and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among AIGs various legal entities. AIG generally obtains letters of credit from third party financial institutions in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. At December 31, 2006, approximately $4.0 billion of letters of credit were outstanding to cover intercompany reinsurance transactions with AIRCO or other General Insurance subsidiaries. Although reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIGs exposure to potentially significant losses. AIG continually evaluates the reinsurance markets and the relative attractiveness of various arrangements for coverage, including structures such as catastrophe bonds, insurance risk securitizations and sidecar and similar vehicles. Effective July 15, 2006, Lexington and Concord Re Limited (Concord Re), a sidecar reinsurer that was established exclusively to reinsure Lexington, entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement covering the U.S. commercial property insurance business written by Lexington. Concord Re was capitalized with approximately $730 million through the issuance of equity securities and loans from third party investors. AIG and its subsidiaries invest in a wide variety of investment vehicles managed by third parties where AIG has no control over investment decisions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such vehicles do not, or will not, hold securities of Concord Re. Reinsurance Recoverable The Reinsurance Security Department reviews the nature of the risks ceded to reinsurers and the requirements for credit risk mitigants. For example, in AIGs treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG frequently includes provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in policyholders surplus below predetermined levels or reaching maximum limits of reinsurance recoverable. In addition, AIGs CRC reviews all reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approves most large reinsurer credit limits that represent actual or potential credit concentrations. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIGs business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract. AIGs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to $21.8 billion at December 31, 2006. AIG manages the credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2006, approximately 54 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. Many of these balances were collateralized, permitting statutory recognition. Additionally, with the approval of insurance regulators, AIG posted approximately $2 billion of letters of credit issued by commercial banks in favor of certain Domestic General Insurance companies to permit those companies statutory recognition of balances otherwise uncollateralized at December 31, 2006. The remaining 46 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. At December 31, 2006, approximately 85 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A (strong) or better, as rated by S&P. These ratings are measures of financial strength. 90 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table provides information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of AIGs general reinsurance assets at December 31, 2006.

(b) Excludes Equitas gross reinsurance assets that are unrated, which are less than five percent of AIGs general reinsurance assets. At December 31, 2006, consolidated general reinsurance assets of $21.8 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $1.0 billion and $17.3 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses IBNR (ceded reserves) and $3.5 billion of ceded reserve for unearned premiums. The ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves involve significant judgment in projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years and are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserves for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2006 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. AIG maintains an allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance of $536 million. The allowance was reduced substantially during 2006, as uncollectible amounts due from individual reinsurers were charged off against the allowance, primarily as a result of the balance sheet reconciliation remediation process; in addition, a portion of the allowance was reclassified to align it with the related receivable. The reduction for charge offs was partially offset by additional provisions totaling $147 million during 2006. At December 31, 2006, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). Segment Risk Management Other than as described above, AIG manages its business risk oversight activities through its business segments. Insurance Operations AIGs multiple insurance businesses conducted on a global basis expose AIG to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. These risks are managed throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures, including: (i) pre launch approval of product design, development and distribution; (ii) underwriting approval processes and authorities; (iii) exposure limits with ongoing monitoring; (iv) modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events); (v) compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets; (vi) extensive use of reinsurance, both internal and third party; and (vii) review and establishment of reserves. AIG has two major categories of insurance risks as follows: General Insurance risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, management liability and mortgage insurance. Risks in the general insurance segment are managed through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, correlation and catastrophic risk events. Life Insurance & Retirement Services risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities in the retirement savings oriented products. In the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, risk is aggregated and limited by individual/group, product group, country and catastrophic risk events. AIG closely manages insurance risk by overseeing and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums charged for taking on the risk. Concentrations of risk primarily arise from external events, such as wind, flood, earthquake, terrorism and pandemics, which are analyzed using various modeling techniques. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its insurance operations. The use of reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). Pooling of AIGs reinsurance risks enables AIG to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for the General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. General Insurance In General Insurance, underwriting risks are managed through the application approval process, exposure limitations as well as through exclusions, coverage limits and reinsurance. The risks covered by AIG are managed through limits on delegated under Form 10 K 2006 AIG 91 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued writing authority, the use of sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis as part of the determination of overall adequacy of provisions for insurance contract liabilities. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection, and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risk accepted. Catastrophe Exposures The nature of AIGs business exposes it to various catastrophic risk events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIGs operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, such as the Avian Influenza A Virus (H5N1), could adversely affect AIGs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs. AIG evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized models, among other techniques. AIG supplements these models by periodically monitoring the risk exposure of AIGs worldwide General Insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly. Following is an overview of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural perils, which includes exposures for DBG, Personal Lines, Foreign General (other than Ascot), HSB and 21st Century. Transatlantic and Ascot utilize a different model, and their combined results are presented separately below. The modeled results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to AIG in accordance with their terms. It is important to recognize that there is no standard methodology to project the possible losses from total property and workers compensation exposures. Further, there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Therefore, these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies. These estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect AIGs maximum exposures to these events. It is highly likely that AIGs losses will vary, perhaps significantly, from these estimates. The modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability (AEP) losses which represent total property and workers compensation losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events. The model, which has been updated to reflect 2005 catastrophes, generally used exposure data as of mid year 2006 and the current reinsurance program structure. The values provided were based on 100 year return period losses, which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. Thus, the model projects that there is a one percent probability that AIG could incur in any year losses in excess of the modeled amounts for these perils. Net, After Percentage of Total Net of Income Shareholders Equity at (in millions) Gross Reinsurance Taxes December 31, 2006 Natural Peril: Earthquake $ 3,676 $ 2,474 $1,608 1.6% Tropical Cyclone* $ 4,780 $ 3,196 $2,077 2.0% * Includes hurricanes, typhoons and other wind related events. The combined earthquake and tropical cyclone 100 year return period modeled losses for Ascot and Transatlantic together are estimated to be $1.1 billion, on a gross basis, $761 million, net of reinsurance, and $494 million, net after income taxes, or 0.5 percent of total shareholders equity at December 31, 2006. In addition, AIG evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred. The single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by Lloyds(1) and referred to as Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDSs). The purpose of this analysis is to utilize these RDSs to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results. However, it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that AIG could incur from this type of an event in these regions. The losses associated with the RDSs are included in the table below. Single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to AIGs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas. Gross values represent AIGs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles, and net values represent losses after all reinsurance is applied.

As a result, AIG runs its own simulations where statistical return period losses associated with the written exposure specific to AIG provide the basis for monitoring risk. Based on these simulations, the 100 year return period for Japanese Earthquake is $296 million gross, and $120 million net, the 100 year return period for European Windstorm is $269 million gross, and $80 million net, and the 100 year return period for Japanese Typhoon is $306 million gross, and $252 million net. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD ARE LIKELY TO VARY, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, FROM THE MODELED SCENARIOS, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE SEVERE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AIGS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY. Measures Implemented to Control Hurricane and Earthquake Catastrophic Risk Catastrophic risk from the earthquake and hurricane perils is proactively managed through reinsurance programs, and aggregate accumulation monitoring. Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased by AIG from financially sound reinsurers. Recoveries under this program, along with other non catastrophic reinsurance protections, are reflected in the net values provided in the tables above. In addition to catastrophic reinsurance programs, hurricane and earthquake exposures are controlled by periodically monitoring aggregate exposures. The aggregate exposures are calculated by compiling total liability within AIG defined hurricane and earthquake catastrophe risk zones and therefore represent the maximum that could be lost in any individual zone. These aggregate accumulations are tracked over time in order to monitor both long and short term trends. AIGs major property writers, Lexington and AIG private client group, have also implemented catastrophe related underwriting procedures and manage their books at an account level. Lexington individually models most accounts prior to binding in order to specifically quantify catastrophic risk for each account. Terrorism Exposure to loss from terrorist attack is controlled by limiting the aggregate accumulation of workers compensation and property insurance that is underwritten within defined target locations. Modeling is used to provide projections of probable maximum loss by target location based upon the actual exposures of AIG policyholders. Terrorism risk is monitored to manage AIGs exposure. AIG shares its exposures to terrorism risks under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). During 2006, AIGs deductible under TRIA was approximately $3.3 billion, with a 10 percent share of certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible. As of January 1, 2007, the deductible increased to approximately $4.0 billion, with a 15 percent share of certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible. Without an extension by Congress, TRIA will sunset at December 31, 2007. Should TRIA not be renewed, AIG would expect to reassess and modify its underwriting guidelines and retention levels as appropriate. Life Insurance & Retirement Services In Life Insurance & Retirement Services, the primary risks are (i) underwriting, which represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience emerging adversely in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses; and (ii) investment risk which represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. AIG businesses manage these risks through exposure limitations and the active management of the asset liability relationship in their operations. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for a particular period. AIGs Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.7 million of coverage. AIGs Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to $10 million of coverage in certain circumstances by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. In Life Insurance & Retirement Services, the reinsurance programs provide risk mitigation per policy, per individual life and group covers and for catastrophic risk events. Pandemic Influenza The potential for a pandemic influenza outbreak has received much recent attention. While outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue to occur among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in Asia, Europe, including the U.K., and Africa, transmission to humans has been rare to date. If the virus mutates to a form that can be transmitted from human to human, it has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide. If such an outbreak were to take place, early quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment. The contagion and mortality rates of any mutated H5N1 virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative. AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A significant global outbreak could have a material adverse effect on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates. AIG continues to analyze its exposure to this serious threat and has engaged an external risk management firm to model loss scenarios associated with an outbreak of Avian Flu. Using a 1 in 100 year return period, AIG estimates its after tax net losses under its life insurance policies due to Avian Flu at less than 1 percent of consolidated shareholders equity as of December 31, 2006. This estimate was calculated over a 3 year period, although the majority of the losses would be incurred in the first year. The modeled losses calculated were based on 2005 policy data representing approximately 90 percent of AIGs individual life, group life and credit life books of business, net of reinsurance. This estimate does not include claims that could be made under other policies, such as business interruption or general liability Form 10 K 2006 AIG 93 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued policies, and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of AIGs own business operations that may arise out of such a pandemic. The model used to generate this estimate has only recently been developed. The reasonableness of the model and its underlying assumptions cannot readily be verified by reference to comparable historical events. As a result, AIGs actual losses from a pandemic influenza outbreak are likely to vary significantly from those predicted by the model. Investments AIGs fixed maturity investments totaled $417.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to $385.7 billion at December 31, 2005. AIGs investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization, diversification and credit limits. These strategies are intended to produce a reasonably stable and predictable return throughout the economic cycle, without undue risk or volatility. At December 31, 2006, approximately 57 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 39 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately five percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is rated by Moodys, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. The CRC closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolios non rated fixed income investments. At December 31, 2006, approximately 20 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately five percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. The credit ratings of fixed maturity investments, other than those of AIGFP, at December 31, 2006 were: 2006 AAA 31% AA 26 A 23 BBB 14 Below investment grade 4 Non rated 2 Total 100% AIG uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide in the life insurance business to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. AIGs objective is to maintain a matched asset liability structure. However, in certain markets, the absence of long dated fixed income instruments may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets. In addition, AIG may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position. Financial Services AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Aircraft Leasing AIGs Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to scheduled and charter airlines and companies associated with the airline industry. Risks inherent in this business, and which are managed at the business unit level, include: (i) the risk that there will be no market for the aircraft acquired; (ii) the risk that aircraft cannot be placed with lessees; (iii) the risk of nonperformance by lessees; and (iv) the risk that aircraft and related assets cannot be disposed of at the time and in a manner desired. Capital Markets The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted primarily through AIGFP, which engages as principal in standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit products with top tier corporations, financial institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors and high net worth individuals throughout the world. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets operations. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to monitor on an ongoing basis the various financial market, operational and credit risk attendant to the Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIGFP actively manages its exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business. The majority of AIGFPs credit derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides such credit protection on a second loss basis, under which AIGFPs payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses. The threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. In certain cases, the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk, which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies. Typically, there 94 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers that are rated, generally a BBB rated layer, an A rated layer, an AA rated layer, and one or more AAA rated layers. In transactions that are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which AIGFPs payment obligation would generally arise is rated AAA by the rating agencies. In transactions that are not rated, AIGFP applies the same risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations. Therefore, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer, defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated AAA by the credit rating agencies, or if the transaction is not rated, equivalent thereto. AIGFP continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP having a payment obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to economically hedge specific securities in a portfolio and thereby further limit its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion. At December 31, 2006, the notional amount with respect to the Capital Markets credit derivative portfolio (including the super senior transactions) was $483.6 billion. Financial Services securities available for sale is predominately a diversified portfolio of high grade fixed income securities. At December 31, 2006, the average credit rating of this portfolio was in the AA+ category or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with $128 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2006 amounted to approximately $340 million in fair value representing 0.7 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have been no significant downgrades through February 15, 2007. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs payment obligations, including its debt obligations. AIGFPs management objective is to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security, which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. These hedging activities did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. To help manage this risk, AIGFPs credit department operates within the guidelines set by the CRC. Transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the specific approval of the CRC. It is also AIGs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the transactions size and maturity. Furthermore, AIGFP generally seeks to enter into agreements that have the benefit of set off and close out netting provisions. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP can set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values. The fair value of AIGFPs interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts approximated $19.25 billion at December 31, 2006 and $18.70 billion at December 31, 2005. Where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective close out netting provisions. AIGFP independently evaluates the counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from rating agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis consistent with the risk rating policies of the CRC. In addition, AIGFPs credit approval process involves pre set counterparty and country credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, requires approval from the CRC. AIG estimates that the average credit rating of Capital Markets derivatives counterparties, measured by reference to the fair value of its derivative portfolio as a whole, is equivalent to the AA rating category. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 95 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the distribution by counterparty credit quality with respect to the fair value of Capital Markets derivatives portfolios was as follows: Percentage of Total Fair Value 2006 2005 Counterparty credit quality: AAA 28 % 24 % AA 41 43 A 19 21 BBB 11 9 Below investment grade 1 3 Total 100 % 100 % Capital Markets Trading VaR AIGFP maintains a very conservative market risk profile and minimizes risk in interest rates, equities, commodities and foreign exchange. Market exposures in option implied volatilities, correlations and basis risks are also minimized over time but those are the main types of market risks that AIGFP manages. As a result, AIGFPs operating income due to changes in market prices and rates is generally a very small percentage of its overall operating income. AIGFPs minimal reliance on market risk driven revenue is reflected in its VaR. AIGFPs VaR calculation is based on the interest rate, equity, commodity and foreign exchange risk arising from its portfolio. Because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of the financial instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. In the calculation of VaR for AIGFP, AIG uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all transactions under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as Bloomberg or Reuters, or third party broker quotes. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not deviated from these models in any material respect. AIGFP reports its VaR using a 95 percent confidence interval and a one day holding period, facilitating risk comparison with AIGFPs trading peers and reflecting the fact that market risks can be actively assumed and offset in AIGFPs trading portfolio. The following table presents the year end, average, high, and low VaRs on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for Capital Markets operations for the years 2006 and 2005. The diversified VaR is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects. For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (in millions) As of December 31 Average High Low As of December 31 Average High Low Total AIG trading market risk: Diversified $ 4 $ 4 $ 7 $ 3 $ 5 $ 4 $ 7 $ 3 Interest rate 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 1 Currency 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 Equity 3 3 4 2 3 2 5 Commodity 3 3 4 2 2 2 3 1 * In 2006, VaR calculations were changed from a 30 day holding period to a one day holding period. Accordingly, the 2005 VaR amounts have been restated to reflect this change. Consumer Finance AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate and other consumer loans, credit card loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers both domestically and overseas, particularly in emerging markets. Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate loans, non real estate loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AIGCFG, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets. Many of AGFs borrowers are non prime or sub prime. Current economic conditions, such as interest rate and employment levels, can have a direct effect on the borrowers ability to repay these loans. AGF manages the credit risk inherent in its portfolio by using credit scoring models at the time of credit applications, established underwriting criteria, and, in certain cases, individual loan reviews. AGF monitors the quality of the finance receivables portfolio and determines the appropriate level of the allowance for losses through its Credit Strategy and Policy Committee. This Committee bases its conclusions on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, current economic conditions and trends, and each Committee members experience in the consumer finance industry. Through 2006, the credit quality of AGFs finance receivables continued to be strong. However, declines in the strength of the U.S. housing market or economy may adversely affect the future credit quality of these receivables. AIGCFG monitors the quality of its finance receivable portfolio and determines the appropriate level of the allowance for losses through several internal committees. These committees base their 96 AIG 2006 Form 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries conclusions on quantitative analysis, qualitative factors, current economic conditions and trends, political and regulatory implications, competition and the judgment of the committees members. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and payment defaults. Credit loss exposure is managed through a combination of underwriting controls, mix of finance receivables, collateral and collection efficiency. Large product programs are subject to CRC approval. Over half of the finance receivables are real estate loans which are collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Asset Management AIGs Asset Management operations are exposed to various forms of credit, market and operational risks. Asset Management complies with AIGs corporate risk management guidelines and framework and is subject to periodic reviews by the CRC. In addition, transactions are referred to the Asset Management investment committees for approval of investment decisions. The majority of the credit and market risk exposures within Asset Management results from the spread based investment business and the investment activities of AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. In the spread based investment businesses, GIC and MIP, the primary risk is investment risk, which represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the liabilities and the necessary return on investments. Credit risk is also a significant component of the investment strategy for these businesses. Market risk is taken in the form of duration and convexity risk. While AIG generally maintains a matched asset liability relationship, it may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be in an unmatched duration position. The risks in the spread based businesses are managed through exposure limitations, active management of the investment portfolios and close oversight of the asset liability relationship. Within AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., AIG is exposed to the general conditions in global real estate markets and the credit markets. Such exposure can subject Asset Management to delays in real estate sales, additional carrying costs and in turn affect operating results within the segment. These risks are mitigated through the underwriting process, transaction and contract terms and conditions and portfolio diversification by type of project, sponsor, real estate market and country. AIGs exposure to real estate investments is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Asset Management real estate investment committee. Economic Capital Since mid 2005, AIG has been developing a firm wide economic capital model to improve decision making and to enhance shareholder value. Economic Capital is the amount of capital the organization, its segments, profit centers, products or transactions require to cover potential, unexpected losses within a confidence level consistent with the risk profile selected by management. The Economic Capital requirement can then be compared with the economic capital resources available to AIG. The Economic Capital requirement is driven by exposures to risks and correlations among various types of risks. As a global financial conglomerate, AIG is exposed to various risks including underwriting, financial and operational risks. The Economic Capital initiative has modeled these risks into five major categories: property & casualty insurance risk, life insurance risk, market risk, credit risk and operational risk. Within each risk category, there are sub risks that have been modeled in greater detail. The Economic Capital initiative also analyzes and includes diversification benefits within and across risk categories and business segments. A primary objective of the Economic Capital initiative is to develop a comprehensive framework to discuss capital and performance on a risk adjusted basis internally with AIG management and externally with the investment community, credit providers, regulators and rating agencies. Economic Capital analysis provides a framework to validate AIGs capital adequacy, to measure more precisely capital efficiency at various levels throughout the organization, to allocate capital consistently among AIGs businesses, to quantify the specific areas of diversification benefits and to assess relative economic value added by a business, product or transaction to AIG as a whole. The Economic Capital initiative will also be a component in developing a more efficient capital structure. Other key areas of Economic Capital applications include strategic decision making for mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, risk retention, reinsurance and hedging strategies and product development and pricing. During 2006, AIG developed a methodology framework that incorporates financial services industry best practices, maintains consistency with regulatory frameworks and reflects AIGs distinct global business and management strategies. By utilizing stochastic simulation techniques, where appropriate, AIG enhanced existing models or developed new ones through a collaborative effort among business executives, actuaries, finance specialists and risk professionals. Initial assessments of Economic Capital were made and AIG began reviewing its economic capital model methodology with the rating agencies. The initial assessments were made at the corporate, segment and major business unit level, and detailed analyses of selected businesses and products were undertaken. AIG also developed assessments of diversification benefits across lines of business, geographic regions and risk categories. Given the breadth and global nature of AIGs businesses, these benefits were found to be significant. The initial assessments have provided useful insight into the overall capital strength of the corporation and its segments and, to date, the initiative has introduced guidance concerning processes to assess economic risk and returns for selected issues, including funding and investment strategies for the MIP, product development, pricing, hedging for living benefits in the variable annuity business and asset liability management strategies for life insurance products, particularly in Asian markets. Form 10 K 2006 AIG 97 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Throughout 2007, AIG will continue to enhance the methodology to provide assurance regarding the completeness and relevance of the models results. AIG will continue discussions with the rating agencies concerning its enterprise risk management processes and the results of its new economic capital model for their consideration in the rating process. AIGs analysis and conclusions concerning the economic capital support of its segments and major business units will be further extended to include consideration for capital availability and mobility. The framework and process will increasingly provide assistance in managements decision making concerning capital management and capital allocation, mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, risk retention, reinsurance and hedging strategies and product development and pricing.
