ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other publicly available documents may include, and AIGs officers and representatives may from time to time make, projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIGs belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIGs control. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements include statements preceded by, followed by or including words such as "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "plan", "view", "target" or "estimate". These projections, goals, assumptions and statements may address, among other things: the timing of the disposition of the ownership position of the United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) in AIG; the timing and method of repayment of the preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC held by the Department of the Treasury; the fair value of AIA and cash flow projections for AIGs Maiden Lane Interests; the monetization of AIGs interests in International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); AIGs exposures to subprime mortgages, monoline insurers, the residential and commercial real estate markets, state and municipal bond issuers and sovereign bond issuers; AIGs exposure to European governments and European financial institutions; AIGs strategy for risk management; AIGs ability to retain and motivate its employees; AIGs generation of deployable capital; AIGs return on equity and earnings per share long term aspirational goals; AIGs strategy to grow net investment income, efficiently manage capital and reduce expenses; AIGs strategy for customer retention, growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves; and The revenues and combined ratios of AIGs subsidiaries. It is possible that AIGs actual results and financial condition will differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements. Factors that could cause AIGs actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific projections, goals, assumptions and statements include: actions by credit rating agencies; changes in market conditions; the occurrence of catastrophic events; significant legal proceedings; concentrations in AIGs investment portfolios, including its municipal bond portfolio; judgments concerning casualty insurance underwriting and reserves; judgments concerning the recognition of deferred tax assets; judgments concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) recoverability; AIG 2011 Form 10 K 49 Table of Contents judgments concerning the recoverability of aircraft values in ILFCs fleet; and such other factors as are discussed throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us, and our mean AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries.  USE OF NON GAAP MEASURES Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis using underwriting profit (loss). Operating income (loss), which is income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) and related deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization, is utilized to report results for SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) operations. Management believes that these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIGs insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable measurement derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), pre tax income, are included in Results of Operations.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This executive overview of managements discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIGs securities. This Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW As further discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG concluded that $16.6 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released through the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2011. AIGs loss from continuing operations before income taxes represented a $19.0 billion decrease compared to its 2010 income and reflected the following: a $3.3 billion net loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the first quarter of 2011, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) Credit Facility) on January 14, 2011, partially offset by a $484 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the exchange of junior subordinated debt; significant catastrophe losses for Chartis totaling $3.3 billion, including losses from Thailand floods in the fourth quarter of 2011, Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami (the Tohoku catastrophe) in the first quarter of 2011, compared to catastrophe losses of $1.1 billion in 2010; losses for Aircraft Leasing of $1.7 billion due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges on aircraft in both 2011 and 2010; 50 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents $604 million in unfavorable fair value adjustments on AIGs economic interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and equity interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) (together, the Maiden Lane Interests); 2010 included a gain of $17.8 billion on sales of divested businesses, primarily consisting of a gain of $16.3 billion from the completion of the initial public offering and listing of AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on October 29, 2010, as well as a gain of $1.3 billion recognized in 2010 related to the sale of AIGs headquarters building in Tokyo in 2009 which gain had been deferred until the expiration of certain lease provisions; and income in 2010 from divested businesses prior to their sale totaling $2.5 billion, primarily representing AIA. Partially offsetting these declines were; a reduction in prior year adverse loss development in 2011 compared to 2010; a decrease in interest expense of $4.1 billion primarily resulting from the January 2011 repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; an increase in the fair value of AIA ordinary shares; and a reduction in realized capital losses in 2011 compared to 2010. In 2011, AIG recorded income from discontinued operations net of taxes of $1.5 billion, which included a pre tax gain of $2.0 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2011 on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) compared to a net loss of $2.1 billion in 2010, which included goodwill impairment charges of $4.6 billion associated with the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Results of Operations herein for additional discussion of our results.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY OVERVIEW AIG substantially completed its recapitalization plan (the Recapitalization) and its asset disposition plan with the following significant milestones in 2011: On January 14, 2011 (the Closing), AIG completed the Recapitalization, which included: repaying the $20.7 billion outstanding balance and terminating the FRBNY Credit Facility; applying proceeds from the AIA initial public offering and the ALICO sale to partially pay down the preferred interests in the special purpose vehicles that held AIA and ALICO (the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, respectively, and collectively, the SPVs, and such preferred interests, the SPV Preferred Interests). As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests; and exchanging preferred stock held by the Department of the Treasury and the AIG Credit Facility Trust (the Trust) for AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock). The SPV Preferred Interests were further reduced during 2011 by $11.5 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) and the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities received in the sale of ALICO. In addition, on November 1, 2011, in accordance with the terms of the MetLife escrow agreement from the sale of ALICO, approximately $918 million was released to AIG. These proceeds, together with an additional $53 million, were applied to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasurys AIA SPV Preferred Interests. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc. (ILFC Holdings), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S 1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. All proceeds received by AIG will be used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasurys AIA SPV Preferred Interests. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 51 Table of Contents See Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 1, 4, and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  OTHER CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY DEVELOPMENTS Other significant capital resources and liquidity developments in 2011 include: On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. On September 13, 2011, AIG received approximately $2.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. AIG is using the proceeds from the sale of these notes to pay maturing notes that were issued by AIG to fund the Matched Investment Program (MIP). On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364 Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3 Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated and AIG entered into a $1.5 billion 364 Day Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4 Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4 Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. In November 2011, AIG exchanged $2.4 billion of its outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures for $1.8 billion senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer. The exchange resulted in a pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million, which is reflected in Net loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and a deferred gain of $65 million reflected in Other long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which will be amortized as a reduction to future interest expense. ILFC executed the following transactions in 2011: an unsecured $2.0 billion three year revolving credit facility; a secured $1.5 billion term loan; the issuance of $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes; and the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded losses of $61 million on the extinguishment of debt; See Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 1, 4, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.  OUTLOOK  Priorities for 2012 AIG remains committed to its long term aspirational goals and is focused on the following priorities for 2012: continuing to strengthen and grow AIGs core businesses; developing and implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury; implementing a strategic alternative for ILFC through an initial public offering or sale; managing its capital and interest expense more efficiently; taking appropriate actions to prepare for scenarios under which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) would become AIGs regulator; 52 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure and control environment throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources; and restructuring AIGs operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness.  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting for deferring costs incurred by insurance companies in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts to limit deferral to only costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. As a result, AIG expects a pre tax reduction of Deferred policy acquisition costs at January 1, 2012 of approximately $4.9 billion and an after tax decrease in AIG shareholders equity of approximately $3.3 billion, consisting of a decrease in Retained earnings of approximately $3.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.4 billion. The reduction in DAC is primarily due to costs associated with unsuccessful sales efforts, which are no longer deferrable, and advertising costs that do not meet the direct response advertising criteria under the accounting standard. The reduction in DAC at January 1, 2012 includes a reduction at Chartis of approximately $2.8 billion and SunAmerica of approximately $2.1 billion. The retrospective adoption will improve Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) by approximately $149 million, $90 million and $40 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. The improvement in Income (loss) from continuing operations is primarily due to the amortization of acquisition costs being greater than the deferral of acquisition costs in these years, and therefore due to the adoption of the standard, the reduction in amortization expense is greater than the reduction in deferrals. The impact to these years includes the results from Chartis, SunAmerica, UGC and divested businesses. During this three year period, the composition of DAC reflects the change in the mix of distribution channels. The following table shows the increase (decrease) to pre tax income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for each business unit impacted: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Chartis $ 107 $ 67 $ 51 SunAmerica 46 (11 ) 54 UGC (4 ) 34 1 Divested businesses (66 ) Total $ 149 $ 90 $ 40 Chartis expects the accounting standard will increase its future combined ratio by approximately 50 to 100 basis points. However, the increase could vary depending on the level of premium production, changes in product mix and distribution channels utilized to acquire business. For SunAmerica, the effect on future years earnings will be partially offset by lower amortization resulting from the reduction in the existing DAC asset upon adoption. As a result, this standard is not expected to have a material effect on SunAmerica operating results in 2012. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Chartis Given the continued global economic environment and current property and casualty market conditions, 2012 is expected to remain challenging, but improving trends in certain key indicators may offset some of the challenges. The weakness of ratable exposures (asset values, payrolls, and sales) experienced in 2009 and 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base, as well as continued weakness in commercial insurance rates, were initially expected to continue through 2011. However, in 2011, Chartis observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the United States was beginning to abate. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and AIG 2011 Form 10 K 53 Table of Contents continuing through the fourth quarter of 2011, Chartis observed continuing positive pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business for the first time since 2009. In certain growth economies such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Asia Pacific countries, Chartis continues to expect improved growth.  Strategy Chartis continues to make strides in its strategy to further grow its higher value and less capital intensive lines of business, and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management continues to review the businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures. Chartis seeks to provide value for people and businesses worldwide through the identification and efficient management of risk. In pursuing this mission and in growing its intrinsic value, Chartis has established strategic initiatives in several key areas. Initiatives in these areas are helping Chartis to direct its capital and resources to optimize financial results, while acknowledging that performance in these areas may vary from quarter to quarter depending upon local market conditions, such as pricing and the effects of foreign exchange rates or changes in the investment environment.  Business Mix Changes Chartis is pursuing initiatives to grow in higher value, less volatile lines of business and geographies. In Commercial Insurance, Chartis is leveraging its significant geographic footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid sized businesses with cross border operations. Commercial Insurance is also expanding its presence in the growth economy nations (which primarily includes nations in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America). Chartis new global organizational design will enable Commercial Insurance to more effectively leverage underwriting and product best practices to enhance customer and channel management. In the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, Commercial Insurance expects to improve the quality of its portfolio and to capitalize on market opportunities. In the Asia Pacific region, management expects to leverage the additional distribution and customer base acquired in connection with the purchase of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji). Since 2009, Consumer Insurance has increased net premiums written by 47 percent, primarily driven by the Fuji acquisition. In 2011, Consumer Insurance represented 38 percent of Chartis net premiums written, compared to 30 percent in 2009. Consumer Insurance continues to grow its net premiums written in key markets and to expand internationally. Consumer Insurance has well established global franchises and operations, existing growth strategies in multiple distribution channels which include direct to consumer, agent, broker and affinity groups, and a focus on the growth economy nations. In the Asia Pacific region, the acquisition of Fuji enables the continued expansion of its distribution and customer base across a breadth of products. In the Americas region, Consumer Insurance continues to focus its growth in key areas, such as the high net worth and affluent markets, and will implement a group benefits strategy with American General. In the EMEA region, management expects modest growth and will continue to focus on solid underwriting performance.  Loss Ratio Improvement Chartis expects that by implementing selective pricing, underwriting and distribution strategies, net premiums written will grow without increasing the relative volatility of losses. In addition, Chartis expects to continue to focus on reducing the costs associated with adjusting claims by improving efficiency in servicing its customers, thus improving its loss ratio. In the commercial casualty lines, underwriting changes have been made to address historical experience with respect to adverse development. Changes include increased actuarial involvement in product aggregate pricing and attachments, increased utilization of pricing and predictive models with actuarial support, policy form changes, increased policy exclusions and fewer multi year policies being offered. During 2011, as part of its on going initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long tail lines, Chartis determined to cease writing excess workers compensation business as a stand alone product. In 2011, management took remedial actions related to certain Consumer Insurance programs that did not meet internal performance or operating targets. Accident & Health (A&H) improved in key markets such as Far East, 54 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Europe and Asia Pacific as a result of underwriting actions, and Personal Lines improved as a result of rate increases in key markets, such as the Far East region.  Expense Discipline To achieve expense reductions, Chartis plans to take advantage of its global footprint to improve efficiencies and expand the use of shared services to support regional businesses in strategic locations, reduce use of external services and negotiate preferred rates with vendors. In the near term, Chartis may increase certain operating expenses in order to develop future improvements and efficiencies. As a result of the business mix shift and the investment in the growth economy nations, policy acquisition expenses are expected to increase in 2012. Chartis expects, however, that these changes will ultimately help to generate business with overall more favorable underwriting results.  Risk Selection Commercial Insurance continued to pursue a comprehensive strategy in 2011 to strengthen its portfolio performance. This includes specific actions in the U.S. Specialty Workers Compensation business. The Commercial Property business continues to improve through increased rates, improved terms and conditions and reductions in exposures to U.S. catastrophes. Additionally, Commercial Insurance is implementing the development and use of pricing and risk selection tools in many lines of business. Consumer Insurance continued to exercise underwriting discipline in risk selection processes to balance risk exposures to the premiums charged in most lines of business in 2011. Improved premium pricing methods through a better understanding of risk attributes has led to better risk selection. Investments continue to be made in risk and marketing analytics, which will further strengthen Chartis capabilities in these areas.  Capital Deployment Chartis scale and geographical diversification also allow the business to strategically deploy capital to pursue the more attractive long term opportunities around the world. Chartis regularly reviews and adjusts its business mix with the goals of aligning risk profile with risk tolerance and meeting capital management objectives. In the second half of 2011, Chartis began to restructure renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a more capital efficient loss reimbursement deductible structure. The deductible structure reduces net premiums written and limits the variability around individual insured premium and claim adjustments when compared to retrospectively rated programs. This overall reduction in the premium and claims adjustment variability creates a corresponding reduction in the required capital needed to support this business. The effect of these initiatives decreased net premiums written in casualty lines for 2011. Chartis expects further declines in net premiums written in this class of business through 2012. However, given the capital intensive nature of these classes of business, Chartis expects that over time, these actions will improve its overall results. In 2012, Chartis expects to continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units and executing underwriting and reinsurance strategies to improve capital ratios and reduce volatility, increase return on equity by line of business and reduce exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends.  Investments Consistent with AIGs worldwide insurance investment policy, Chartis places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, and to a lesser extent, common stocks, private equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis historically have included tax exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to better optimize its overall investment portfolio, including risk return and tax objectives, Chartis has begun to shift from tax exempt municipal bonds to taxable AIG 2011 Form 10 K 55 Table of Contents instruments, which meet Chartis liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives. In addition, Chartis has redeployed cash in excess of operating needs and short term investments into longer term, higher yielding securities. Chartis makes determinations of other than temporary impairments based on the fundamental credit analyses of individual securities. Life settlement contracts are evaluated on a contract by contract basis to assess impairment. During the second quarter of 2011, Chartis implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individuals health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. Chartis also revised its valuation table, which it uses in estimating future net cash flows. Recently, a number of courts have addressed various life settlement related issues in their decisions. Chartis does not expect that the rulings in those cases will have a significant effect on its investment in life settlement contracts. See Segment Results Chartis Operations Chartis Results Chartis Investing and Other Results and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  SunAmerica SunAmerica continues to pursue its goals of expanding the breadth and depth of its distribution relationships, introducing competitive new products and product riders, maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and strong statutory surplus, pro actively managing expenses and, subject to regulatory approval, increasing payments made to AIG Parent. SunAmerica made progress on all of these efforts during 2011, and expects this progress to continue for 2012. SunAmericas businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and equity market volatility. Continued low interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns, negatively affect future sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits. Also, products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields are insufficient to support current valuation interest rates. Equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features, and both equity market volatility and low interest rates can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets. SunAmericas insurance companies, like other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. State regulation relates primarily to financial condition as well as corporate conduct and market conduct activities; in particular, states have also become increasingly aggressive in using escheatment laws to seek recovery of unclaimed life insurance benefits. There are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations, and a review of insurance solvency regulation throughout the U.S. regulatory system, which could significantly affect SunAmericas businesses. At the federal level, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank) will subject SunAmericas insurers, investment advisors, broker dealers and their affiliates to additional federal regulation. In addition, regulators and lawmakers around the world are developing recommendations to address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, and related issues, which could potentially affect SunAmerica. See Item 1. Business Regulation for additional information.  Variable Annuities SunAmerica experienced an increase in its variable annuity sales as various distribution partners resumed sales of SunAmericas products during 2010 and 2011. SunAmericas largest pre financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner resumed distribution of SunAmericas products in mid 2011. As a result of broader distribution opportunities, SunAmerica expects variable annuity sales to remain strong in 2012. SunAmerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, 56 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. SunAmerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged. In 2011, SunAmerica experienced losses of $265 million from these unhedged positions, primarily as a result of the effect of declining interest rates. SunAmerica has purchased additional hedges and is contemplating additional capital efficient strategies to reduce this interest rate exposure. SunAmerica is also exposed to the risk of policyholder behavior differing from that assumed in its pricing model.  Fixed Annuities After a period of historic lows, interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first three months of 2011 before declining significantly in the latter part of 2011. Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. As a result, SunAmericas fixed annuity sales declined significantly in the last six months of 2011 compared to the first six months. If the low interest rate environment continues, SunAmerica expects fixed annuities sales (including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) to decline in 2012.  Life Insurance SunAmericas strategic focus includes disciplined underwriting, active expense management, product innovation, a high quality investment portfolio and a strong capital position. SunAmericas distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent distributor channel with investments in enhanced service technology, and expanding its market presence to additional channels and niche markets. SunAmericas retail life sales increased 17 percent during 2011. Based on industry information available through the first nine months of 2011, this growth rate exceeded that of the industry as SunAmerica continued to re engage distributors lost during the 2008 economic crisis. SunAmerica anticipates this trend to continue in 2012. The economic environment has put pressure on consumer spending capacity, which, in part, has tempered sales of universal life products which typically have higher annual premiums than term products and also offer additional features. The direct to consumer channel has proven effective for the distribution of certain types of less complex products, and provides opportunities to bring innovative product solutions to the market that take advantage of new underwriting technologies. Sales growth through SunAmericas affiliated Matrix Direct channel outpaced retail sales growth and SunAmerica continues to have a positive outlook on future direct sales. The career distribution channel is focused on improving agent retention and productivity. Career distribution sales in 2011 benefitted from a product suite that has proven appealing to consumers, which is offered though a highly focused, affiliated distribution group using improved point of sale technologies. Steady growth from this channel is expected to continue.  Investments SunAmerica built up a large cash and short term investment position beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 with the intention of purchasing all the assets in the ML II portfolio. Following the FRBNYs decision in early 2011 to begin selling the MLII assets through a competitive bidding process, SunAmerica began acquiring other fixed maturity investments, including certain securities from ML II. Beginning late in the first quarter of 2011, SunAmerica began investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer term higher yielding securities to improve spreads, while actively managing credit and liquidity risks. SunAmerica substantially completed this reinvestment during the year, reducing its cash and short term investment position from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2010 to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2011. During 2011, SunAmerica sold approximately $12.9 billion of investments, which enhanced statutory capital and generated capital gains. The proceeds of these sales were reinvested at generally lower yields. The impact of these lower yields, however, was more than offset by the effect of cash redeployment discussed above. Additionally, during prolonged periods of low or declining interest rates, SunAmerica has to invest net flows and re invest interest and principal payments from its investment portfolios in lower yielding securities. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 57  Table of Contents  Interest Crediting Rates SunAmericas annuity and universal life products have contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Due to the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and the minimum crediting rate guarantees, continuation of the current low interest rate environment may reduce SunAmericas interest spreads which may reduce future profitability. SunAmerica partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset liability management process, product design elements, and crediting rate strategies. A prolonged low interest rate environment may, nevertheless, negatively affect spreads on interest sensitive business. As indicated in the table below, approximately 45 percent of SunAmericas annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of December 31, 2011. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of December 31, 2011 ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent with the higher rates representing older product guarantees.

Aircraft Leasing ILFC continues to execute on its strategy of managing its fleet of aircraft by ordering new aircraft with high customer demand and through potential sales or part outs of its older aircraft that cannot be economically leased to customers. As new and more fuel efficient aircraft enter the marketplace and negatively affect the demand for older aircraft, lease rates on older aircraft may deteriorate and ILFC may incur additional losses on sales or record impairment charges and fair value adjustments. 58 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents In the near term, challenges in the global economy, including the European sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainty in the Middle East, and sustained higher fuel prices have negatively impacted many airlines profitability, cash flows and liquidity, and increased the probability that some, including ones that are ILFC customers, will cease operations or file for bankruptcy. During the year ended December 31, 2011, ILFC had seven of its lessees cease operations or file for bankruptcy (or its equivalent) and return nine of its aircraft. Since December 31, 2011, ILFC has had four additional lessees cease operations or file for bankruptcy (or its equivalent) and return 42 of its aircraft. Of these aircraft, 17 remain to be re leased as of February 21, 2012. Future events, including a prolonged recession, ongoing uncertainty regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, political unrest, continued weak consumer demand, high fuel prices, or restricted availability of credit to the aviation industry could lead to the weakening or cessation of operations of additional airlines, which in turn would adversely affect ILFCs earnings and cash flows. On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S 1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed.  Other Operations  Mortgage Guaranty UGC has continued its strategy of differentiating itself from its competitors through its risk based pricing approach and has emerged as a leading producer of new mortgage insurance business. UGC believes its differentiated pricing and underwriting practices have helped establish it as a leader in the industry. During 2011, UGC has significantly increased new insurance written over 2010 levels while improving the risk profile of its in force book of business. The mortgage insurance industry, however, has come under continued financial stress during 2011 due to the continued poor macroeconomic conditions with some mortgage insurers exceeding their respective regulatory capital leverage ratios. As a result, two of these insurers have ceased selling new insurance and the parent of one of these insurers was placed into bankruptcy. The withdrawal of these competitors from the market combined with the differentiation strategy that UGC implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned the company to take advantage of market opportunities. UGC plans to continue this strategy during 2012 with continuing improvements in market share and continued improvement in the risk profile of new business written. In older books of business, primarily the 2005 to 2008 books, newly reported delinquencies declined while increased claims severity and overturns on previously denied claims unfavorably affected results. UGC continued to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly with respect to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations resulted in loan rescissions totaling $746 million of claims on first lien business during 2011 compared to $781 million during 2010. Although rescissions will continue to have a positive effect on UGCs financial results, higher levels of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues have offset rescissions. During 2011 rescissions totaling $411 million of risk were overturned compared to $172 million in 2010. While these items may increase volatility in the future, UGC believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns, consistent with industry practice. Additionally, during 2011, UGC changed its follow up practice for loans that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured. Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, UGC contacted lenders regarding 18,000 loans or approximately 19 percent of the delinquent inventory and requested that, in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies, the lender file a claim. By the end of 2011, UGC had received responses to approximately half of the requests. UGC continues to monitor and review the status of these requests as well as contacting lenders on an ongoing basis about additional delinquencies that meet these criteria. Under these master policies, if a claim is not submitted within a year of UGCs request, coverage will be cancelled. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 59 Table of Contents Foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys general investigations into lenders foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 have slowed the reporting of claims from foreclosures, which has increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability. UGCs assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend, although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. UGC expects that this trend may continue and may negatively affect UGCs future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively, may have on its future results of operations or financial condition. In addition, UGC has segmented its reserving approach to consider slower development patterns and higher severity in certain states separately from other states. UGC expects to continue this practice as long as significant variances persist among states. In March 2011, federal regulators, as required by Dodd Frank, issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) in respect of which issuers of asset backed securities would not be subject to certain risk retention requirements. The QRM definition included, among other standards, a maximum loan to value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations could adversely impact UGCs volume of domestic first lien new insurance written, depending on the final definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, ascribed to private mortgage insurance.  Global Capital Markets The active wind down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Although the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, the portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIGs risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.  Direct Investment Book MIP assets and liabilities and certain non derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP (collectively the Direct Investment book or DIB) are currently managed collectively on a single program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent. Liquidity requirements for the DIB are managed by transferring cash between AIG Parent and AIGFP as needed. Program management is focused on winding down this portfolio over time, and reducing and managing its liquidity needs, including contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting, for both derivative and debt positions of the DIB. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, AIG may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis, subject to market conditions. Certain non derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.  Retained Interests Retained Interests may continue to experience volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares and the retained interest in ML III. At December 31, 2011, AIG owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of AIA. A one Hong Kong dollar change in AIAs share price would result in an approximate $500 million change in AIGs pre tax income.  Corporate & Other In 2011, AIG completed the Recapitalization, executed transactions in the debt and equity capital markets and substantially completed its asset disposition plan. It is expected that declines in interest expense and disposition activity costs will be at least partially offset in the short term by increases in other corporate expenses, primarily 60 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents attributable to corporate initiatives and efforts to continue improving internal controls and financial and operating technology platforms. On October 18, 2011, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) published a second notice of proposed rulemaking and related interpretive guidance under Dodd Frank regarding the designation of non bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The new proposal sets forth a three stage determination process for designating non bank SIFIs. In Stage 1, FSOC would apply a set of uniform quantitative thresholds to identify the nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation. Based on its financial condition as of December 31, 2011, AIG would meet the criteria in Stage 1 and would be subject to further evaluation by the FSOC in the SIFI determination process. Because Stages 2 and 3 as proposed would involve qualitative judgment by the FSOC, AIG cannot predict whether it would be designated as a non bank SIFI under the proposed rule. See Item 1. Business Regulation and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIGs chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, AIG changed its segments in the third quarter of 2011. AIG now reports the results of its operations AIG 2011 Form 10 K 61 Table of Contents through three reportable segments: Chartis, SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica), and Aircraft Leasing. Through these reportable segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries. AIGs subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. Aircraft Leasing includes commercial aircraft and equipment leasing. AIGs Other operations category consists of businesses and items not allocated to AIGs reportable segments.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS During 2011, AIG experienced significant favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind down of AIGFPs portfolios, the sale of certain life insurance businesses, emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and a return to sustainable operating profits within its primary operations. Notably: AIG released approximately $16.6 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group. The fourth quarter effect was $17.7 billion, which included valuation allowance increases during the first nine months of 2011. See Critical Accounting Estimates Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset herein and Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information; Chartis prior year adverse loss reserve development declined by $4.6 billion to $211 million; Interest expense declined $4.1 billion, primarily due to the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and Improving equity markets contributed to a $1.3 billion increase in the market valuation of AIGs holding of AIA ordinary shares. Offsetting these favorable developments were record catastrophe losses for Chartis and the effects of several macroeconomic drivers, including declining equity markets, widening credit spreads, and declining interest rates, including: Total catastrophe losses of $3.3 billion for Chartis in 2011 compared to $1.1 billion in 2010; Aircraft Leasing losses of $1.7 billion due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges on aircraft; The widening of credit spreads, reduced interest rates, and changes in the timing of estimated future cash flows drove declines of $604 million in the recorded fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests; AIG recognized a $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, which was partially offset by a $484 million gain on extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange of junior subordinated debt; and Components of operating results decreased due to the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. 62 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The following table presents AIGs consolidated results of operations (comparability with 2010 and 2009 is affected by the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010): Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Revenues: Premiums $ 38,990 $ 45,319 $ 48,583 (14 )% (7 )% Policy fees 2,705 2,710 2,656 2 Net investment income 14,755 20,934 18,992 (30 ) 10 Net realized capital gains (losses) 521 (175 ) (5,210 ) NM 97 Aircraft leasing revenue 4,508 4,749 4,967 (5 ) (4 ) Other income 2,758 3,989 5,459 (31 ) (27 ) Total revenues 64,237 77,526 75,447 (17 ) 3 Benefits, claims and expenses: Policyholder benefits and claims incurred 33,449 41,394 45,311 (19 ) (9 ) Interest credited to policyholder account balances 4,446 4,480 4,704 (1 ) (5 ) Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 8,019 9,134 9,442 (12 ) (3 ) Other acquisition and insurance expenses 6,091 6,775 6,818 (10 ) (1 ) Interest expense 3,871 7,981 14,358 (51 ) (44 ) Aircraft leasing expenses 3,974 4,050 2,385 (2 ) 70 Net loss on extinguishment of debt 2,908 104 NM NM Net (gain) loss on sale of properties and divested businesses 74 (17,767 ) 1,271 NM NM Other expenses 2,470 3,439 5,465 (28 ) (37 ) Total benefits, claims and expenses 65,302 59,590 89,754 10 (34 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) (1,065 ) 17,936 (14,307 ) NM NM Income tax expense (benefit) (18,036 ) 5,859 (1,489 ) NM NM Income (loss) from continuing operations 16,971 12,077 (12,818 ) 41 NM Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense (benefit) 1,535 (2,064 ) 505 NM NM Net income (loss) 18,506 10,013 (12,313 ) 85 NM Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 708 2,227 (1,364 ) (68 ) NM Net income (loss) attributable to AIG $ 17,798 $ 7,786 $ (10,949 ) 129 % NM % The comparisons of 2011 and 2010 results to the respective prior year follow:  Premiums  2011 and 2010 Comparison Premiums decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the deconsolidation in the fourth quarter of 2010 of AIA, which accounted for $9.3 billion of premiums in 2010. The decline in premiums for 2011 compared to 2010 was partially offset by an increase in Chartis premiums, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Premiums decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction of $3.3 billion related to 2009 dispositions that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting. These dispositions included HSB Group, Inc. (HSB), 21st Century Insurance Group (including Agency Auto Division and excluding Chartis AIG 2011 Form 10 K 63 Table of Contents Private Client Group) (21st Century) and AIG Life of Canada (AIG Life Canada), as well as the deconsolidation of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc (Transatlantic) in 2009.  Policy Fees  2011 and 2010 Comparison Policy fees decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 as higher variable annuity fee income was more than offset by lower surrender charges due to decreased surrender rates and universal life unlockings.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Policy fees increased slightly for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher variable annuity fees on separate account assets consistent with the growth in variable accounts assets as a result of favorable equity market conditions in late 2010.  Net Investment Income The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Fixed maturity securities, including short term investments $ 11,814 $ 14,445 $ 14,535 (18 )% (1 )% Change in fair value of ML II 42 513 (25 ) (92 ) NM Change in fair value of ML III (646 ) 1,792 419 NM 328 Change in fair value of AIA securities 1,289 (638 ) NM NM Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to their sale (157 ) 665 NM NM Equity securities 92 234 186 (61 ) 26 Interest on mortgage and other loans 1,065 1,268 1,347 (16 ) (6 ) Alternative investments* 1,213 1,602 4 (24 ) NM Mutual funds 47 (25 ) 315 NM NM Real estate 107 126 139 (15 ) (9 ) Other investments 398 557 306 (29 ) 82 Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains 15,264 20,539 17,226 (26 ) 19 Policyholder investment income and trading gains 886 2,305 NM (62 ) Total investment income 15,264 21,425 19,531 (29 ) 10 Investment expenses 509 491 539 4 (9 ) Net investment income $ 14,755 $ 20,934 $ 18,992 (30 )% 10 % * Includes hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships. 2011 and 2010 Comparison Net investment income decreased primarily due to the following: the effect of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. AIA net investment income prior to deconsolidation in 2010 totaled $4.0 billion, which included $886 million in policyholder trading gains; a decline in the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests of $604 million due to significant widening of credit spreads and reduced interest rates compared to gains of $2.3 billion in 2010; and fair value losses on the MetLife securities prior to their sale in March 2011. 64 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: fair value gains on the AIA ordinary shares in 2011 compared to losses in 2010; and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities, excluding the effect of the AIA deconsolidation, due to higher average invested asset balances as a result of the cash redeployment in 2011.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Net investment income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to significantly higher income from private equity funds and hedge fund investments due to an improved market environment compared to 2009, and increased valuation gains associated with the Maiden Lane Interests. These increases were partially offset by a decline in policyholder trading gains compared to 2009. Policyholder trading gains are offset by a change in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets, principally in Asia.  Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net realized capital gains (losses): Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Sales of fixed maturity securities $ 1,913 $ 1,846 $ 849 4 % 117 % Sales of equity securities 164 725 303 (77 ) 139 Other than temporary impairments: Severity (51 ) (73 ) (1,510 ) 30 95 Change in intent (12 ) (441 ) (958 ) 97 54 Foreign currency declines (32 ) (63 ) (112 ) 49 44 Issuer specific credit events (1,165 ) (2,457 ) (3,979 ) 53 38 Adverse projected cash flows (20 ) (5 ) (137 ) (300 ) 96 Provision for loan losses 48 (304 ) (614 ) NM 50 Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to the sale (191 ) 315 NM NM Foreign exchange transactions (116 ) 178 (616 ) NM NM Derivative instruments 297 138 1,724 115 (92 ) Other (314 ) (34 ) (160 ) NM 79 Net realized capital gains (losses) $ 521 $ (175 ) $ (5,210 ) NM 97 2011 and 2010 Comparison AIG recognized net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010 due to the following: lower other than temporary impairment charges from issuer specific credit events and changes in intent; and improvement in the provision for loan losses due to an increase in collateral values as a result of improved operating performance and improved market conditions. These gains were partially offset by the following: lower gains on sales of equity securities in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher sales in 2010 resulting from the continuing insurance companies portfolio repositioning; fair value losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010 on the MetLife securities prior to their sale in March 2011; foreign exchange transaction losses incurred in 2011 compared to gains in 2010, primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound; and the deconsolidation of AIA. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 65  Table of Contents 2010 and 2009 Comparison Net realized capital losses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the following: increased gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities in 2010; lower other than temporary impairment charges for fixed maturity securities in 2010 as a result of the adoption of the other than temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. See Investments Impairments Other Than Temporary Impairments herein and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and foreign exchange transaction gains incurred in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound compared to 2009. These improvements were partially offset by lower gains from derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, particularly those used to hedge foreign exchange movements.  Aircraft Leasing Revenue  2011 and 2010 Comparison Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly, primarily due to a reduction in ILFCs average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and the impact of lower lease revenue earned on re leased aircraft in its fleet. In 2011, ILFC had an average of 932 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 963 in 2010.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly due to a reduction in ILFCs average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and the impact of lower lease rates on used aircraft. In 2010, ILFC had an average of 963 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 974 in 2009.  Other Income  2011 and 2010 Comparison The decline in Other income for 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by: a decline of $559 million in credit valuation adjustment gains on Direct Investment book non derivative assets and liabilities; a decline of $259 million in unrealized market valuation adjustment gains on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio; a decline of $172 million in unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP credit default swap contracts referencing single name exposures written on corporate, index and asset backed credits, due to losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010; and a bargain purchase gain of $332 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji, which is further discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These declines were partially offset by significantly lower levels of real estate investment impairment charges in 2011.  2010 and 2009 Comparison The decline in Other income for 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by a decline of $1.0 billion and $975 million in credit valuation adjustments on Direct Investment book non derivative assets and liabilities and AIGFP derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, as well as a decline of $820 million in unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. This decline was partially offset by a bargain 66 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents purchase gain of $332 million related to the Fuji acquisition and reduced losses from AIGFP from lower unwind costs.  Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred  2011 and 2010 Comparison Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the following: a decline of $8.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of AIA; and Chartis $72 million of net reserve strengthening in 2011 compared to net strengthening of $4.3 billion in 2010. This decline was partially offset by: increased catastrophe losses throughout the year, including the Thailand floods in the fourth quarter of 2011, Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011, and the Tohoku Catastrophe in the first quarter of 2011; the effect of Chartis consolidation of Fuji; increased claims and claims adjustment expenses for Mortgage Guaranty operations due to increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims; and increased claims at SunAmerica due to enhanced death benefit reserving practices.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in 2010 primarily due to: a reduction of $2.2 billion as a result of the dispositions in 2009 noted above that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting; a decrease in incurred policy losses and benefit expenses for AIA of $1.3 billion related to a decline in policyholder trading gains which are discussed above in Net Investment Income; and a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expense of $2.4 billion for Mortgage Guaranty operations primarily due to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first lien, second lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second lien policies. Partially offsetting these declines were: the net $4.3 billion of reserve strengthening in 2010 compared to reserve strengthening of $2.8 billion in 2009; increased catastrophe losses for Chartis; and the effect of the consolidation of Fuji in 2010. See Segments Results Chartis Operations Chartis Results herein for further discussion.  Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs  2011 and 2010 Comparison The decrease in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. The AIA amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 totaled $977 million. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 67 Table of Contents  2010 and 2009 Comparison The decrease in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulted from the dispositions of HSB, 21st Century, AIG Life Canada and Transatlantic in 2009 and from the decrease in amortization for SunAmerica related to improved equity market conditions.  Other Acquisition and Insurance Expenses  2011 and 2010 Comparison Other acquisition and insurance expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010. AIA other acquisition and insurance expenses in 2010 totaled $1.6 billion.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Other acquisition and insurance expenses decreased slightly in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of a $1.0 billion decrease related to the dispositions in 2009 noted above, partially offset by increased expenses at Chartis, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji noted above.  Interest Expense  2011 and 2010 Comparison Interest expense decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $72 million in 2011 through the date of termination compared to $4.1 billion in 2010, including amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $48 million and $3.5 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility in connection with the Recapitalization in January 2011.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility reflecting a reduced weighted average interest rate on borrowings, a lower average outstanding balance and a decline in amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset as set forth below. Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Weighted average interest rate 3.3 % 4.5 % Average outstanding balance (excluding paid in kind interest) $ 18,775 $ 37,358 Periodic amortization of prepaid commitment fee asset $ 1,766 $ 3,174 Accelerated amortization of prepaid commitment fee asset $ 1,705 $ 5,185 Aircraft Leasing Expenses ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges of $1.7 billion in both 2011 and 2010 and charges of $51 million in 2009. See Segment Results Aircraft Leasing Operations Aircraft Leasing Results for additional information. 68 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents  Net Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt for 2011 includes: a $3.3 billion charge primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, which is further discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and a $484 million gain on extinguishment related to the junior subordinated debt exchange in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Net (Gain) Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses and Properties Net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses and properties includes the net (gain) loss on the sale of divested businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations as well as gains and losses from property disposals in connection with AIGs restructuring program. The gain in 2010 primarily represents a gain of $16.3 billion on the sale of 67 percent of AIA, a gain of $228 million associated with the termination fee paid by Prudential plc to AIG related to the termination of the agreement to purchase AIA and a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of the Otemachi building in Japan. See Segment Results Chartis Operations Chartis Results Chartis Other Chartis Other Results herein for further information.  Other Expenses  2011 and 2010 Comparison Other expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to; lower securities related litigation charges; and lower restructuring charges.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Other expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to: goodwill impairment charges of $612 million recorded in 2009 related to the Institutional Asset Management business; lower compensation related costs for the Institutional Asset Management business, including the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of the Swiss bank; and lower provisions for credit losses for consumer finance businesses not presented as discontinued operations.  Income Taxes  2011 Effective Tax Rate For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pretax loss from continuing operations was not meaningful, due to the significant effect of releasing approximately $16.6 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Other less significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits of $454 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $346 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and $224 million associated with AIGs investment in subsidiaries and partnerships  2010 Effective Tax Rate For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on pre tax income from continuing operations was 32.7 percent. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, attributable to continuing operations AIG 2011 Form 10 K 69 Table of Contents differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits of $1.3 billion associated with AIGs investment in subsidiaries and partnerships, principally the AIA SPV which is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and $587 million associated with tax exempt interest, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations of $1.5 billion.  2009 Effective Tax Rate For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss from continuing operations was 10.4 percent. The effective tax rate on the pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, differed from the statutory rate primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance of $3.1 billion and reserve for uncertain tax positions of $874 million, partially offset by tax exempt interest of $677 million and the change in investment in subsidiaries and partnerships of $473 million which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to sales of subsidiaries. See Critical Accounting Estimates Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset herein and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Discontinued Operations  Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations is comprised of the following: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Foreign life insurance businesses $ 1,133 $ (1,237 ) $ 2,581 AGF (145 ) (904 ) Net gain (loss) on sale 942 1,588 (2,758 ) Consolidation adjustments (1 ) (356 ) 54 Interest allocation (2 ) (75 ) (89 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations 2,072 (225 ) (1,116 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 537 1,839 (1,621 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 1,535 $ (2,064 ) $ 505 Significant items affecting the comparison of results from discontinued operations included the following: a pre tax gain of $2.0 billion on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011; impairments of goodwill in 2010 of $4.6 billion related to ALICO, AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Note 2(j) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion; a pre tax gain of $4.1 billion on the sale of ALICO in 2010; a pre tax loss of approximately $1.7 billion on the sale of AGF in 2010; a pre tax loss of $2.8 billion recognized in 2009 related to the sale of Nan Shan, as well as an additional loss on sale of $874 million recognized in 2010; and tax effects of the above transactions, notably the impact of non deductible goodwill impairments and the change in investment in subsidiaries, which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the planned sales. See Notes 4 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations. 70 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS AIG presents and discusses its financial information in the following manner, which it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of its segments as follows: Chartis underwriting profit (loss), which is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses, and is before net investment income, net realized capital gains (losses), bargain purchase gain and other income (expense) net; SunAmerica and Aircraft Leasing Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization; and Results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses are excluded from these measures. AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre tax income are provided. In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIGs chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, AIG changed its segments in the third quarter of 2011. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on AIGs segment changes. Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for the above items. Additionally, certain other reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current period presentation. The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2011, Chartis completed a reorganization of its operations and now presents its financial information in two operating segments Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance as well as a Chartis Other operations category. Previously, Chartis presented its financial information AIG 2011 Form 10 K 71 Table of Contents under Chartis U.S. and Chartis International. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. As previously noted, AIG presents and discusses its financial information in a manner it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis using underwriting profit (loss) and pre tax income (loss). Underwriting profit (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts. The unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period. Net premiums written for long duration contracts are earned when due from the policyholder. Net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection. Chartis, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses, which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses, divided by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expenses, and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and associated ratios. Chartis will continue to assess the performance of its operating segments based in part on underwriting profit, loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. Chartis believes these metrics provide long term measures of the performance of the business compared to historical results and peer companies. In addition, Chartis is developing new value based metrics that provide management shorter term measures to evaluate its performance across multiple lines and various countries. As an example, Chartis has implemented a risk adjusted profitability model as a business performance measure, which it will continue to refine. Along with underwriting results, this risk adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. Chartis believes that such performance measures will allow it to manage changes in its business mix. Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based upon the loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments are assigned to Chartis Other. For the year ended December 31, 2011, results reflect the effects of the full year of Fuji operations, while the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of Fuji for only two quarters, because Chartis began consolidating Fujis operating results on July 1, 2010. Fuji operations primarily relate to Consumer Insurance. 72 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Chartis Results  The following table presents Chartis results: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Underwriting results: Net premiums written $ 34,840 $ 31,612 $ 30,653 10 % 3 % Decrease in unearned premiums 849 909 1,608 (7 ) (43 ) Net premiums earned 35,689 32,521 32,261 10 1 Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred 27,949 27,867 25,362 10 Underwriting expenses 10,972 10,114 9,497 8 6 Underwriting loss (3,232 ) (5,460 ) (2,598 ) 41 (110 ) Investing and other results: Net investment income 4,348 4,392 3,292 (1 ) 33 Net realized capital gains (losses) 587 (49 ) (530 ) NM 91 Bargain purchase gain 332 NM NM Other income (expense) net* (5 ) 669 NM NM Pre tax income (loss) $ 1,698 $ (116 ) $ 164 NM % NM % * Includes gain on divested properties of $669 million in 2010. 2011 and 2010 Comparison Chartis recognized pre tax income in 2011 compared to a pre tax loss in 2010 primarily due to the decrease in the loss ratio, partially offset by the effect of increased catastrophe losses in 2011, detailed as follows: Net prior year adverse loss development, net of premiums and loss sensitive premium adjustments, decreased from $4.3 billion in 2010 to $72 million in 2011. The combined ratio declined to 109.0 in 2011 from 116.8 in 2010. Catastrophe losses were $3.3 billion in 2011 compared to $1.1 billion in 2010. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 99.8 in 2011, compared to 113.5 in 2010, a 13.7 point improvement. Net realized capital gains on sales of fixed maturity securities increased in connection with Chartis strategy to better align investment allocations with current overall performance and income tax planning objectives. Also, Chartis realized an increase in net premiums written primarily related to the acquisition of Fuji, which Chartis began consolidating on July 1, 2010, and in the Commercial Insurance property lines, which experienced improved pricing and modifications to its reinsurance program.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Chartis reported a pre tax loss in 2010 compared to pre tax income in 2009 primarily due to the increase in the net prior year adverse loss development, net of premiums and loss sensitive premium adjustments, from $2.8 billion in 2009 to $4.3 billion in 2010. In addition, catastrophe losses increased by $1.0 billion. These were partially offset by an increase in net premiums written, primarily related to the Fuji acquisition, as well as improved market conditions and the impact of gains in 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji and the sale of the Otemachi Building.  Chartis Net Premiums Written Net premiums written are the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are recognized, the amount is part of the unearned premium reserve.

These increases were partially offset by the decline in Commercial Casualty business in 2011 and more specifically the effects of risk management initiatives in workers compensation and certain other lines of business in Chartis. They also reflect Chartis continued commitment to maintain price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Chartis net premiums written increased in 2011 by 3.4 percent compared to 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 reflects net premiums written related to Fuji of $4.0 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 also reflects the effects of overall improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general pricing improvement and retrospective premium adjustments on loss sensitive contracts. 74 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Chartis has continued a strategy that started in 2010 to improve the allocation of its reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. As part of this strategy, Chartis has secured $1.45 billion in protection for U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes through three separate catastrophe bond transactions. In 2011, Chartis secured $575 million in a bond transaction and in 2010, $875 million through two separate bond transactions. These bond transactions in 2011 and 2010 reduced net premiums written by approximately $201 million and $208 million, respectively. Growing higher value Consumer business continues to be a key strategy. Total Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased 21 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the Fuji acquisition, Consumer Insurance net premiums written declined by one percent, primarily due to the non renewal of certain programs in the U.S. and Canada region that did not meet internal performance targets. In 2011, management implemented certain initiatives designed to provide for a more effective use of capital, including: restructuring the renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure; and the decision to cease writing excess workers compensation business as a stand alone product. The effect of these actions decreased premiums in 2011 by approximately $0.6 billion. However, given the capital intensive nature of these classes of casualty business, Chartis expects that over time, these actions will improve its results. 2010 and 2009 Comparison Chartis net premiums written increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the Fuji acquisition and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth in higher value lines of business. Excluding the effects of the Fuji transaction, Chartis net premiums written decreased in 2010 by 2.6 percent compared to 2009. This decrease is primarily due to declines in Commercial businesses in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as the effects of risk management initiatives in the U.S. and Canada region designed to reduce catastrophe exposed business in property and overall exposure in Chartis long tail casualty lines. The decrease also reflects Chartis commitment to maintain price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory, as well as overall rate declines and a decline in ratable exposures such as workers compensation. Further, during 2010, Chartis entered into two separate three year reinsurance transactions, secured through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, which provide protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes, and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $208 million. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Chartis net premiums written: Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Increase in original currency* 7.3 % 1.8 % Foreign exchange effect 2.9 1.3 Increase as reported in U.S. dollars 10.2 % 3.1 % * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 75 Table of Contents Chartis Underwriting Ratios The following table summarizes the Chartis combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss sensitive contracts on the Chartis consolidated loss and combined ratios: Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Loss ratio 78.3 85.7 78.6 (7.4 ) 7.1 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (9.2 ) (3.3 ) (0.1 ) (5.9 ) (3.2 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount (0.4 ) (13.2 ) (8.6 ) 12.8 (4.6 ) Loss ratio, as adjusted 68.7 69.2 69.9 (0.5 ) (0.7 ) Expense ratio 30.7 31.1 29.4 (0.4 ) 1.7 Combined ratio 109.0 116.8 108.0 (7.8 ) 8.8 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (9.2 ) (3.3 ) (0.1 ) (5.9 ) (3.2 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount (0.4 ) (13.2 ) (8.6 ) 12.8 (4.6 ) Combined ratio, adjusted 99.4 100.3 99.3 (0.9 ) 1.0 Loss Ratios The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Chartis: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross prior year adverse loss development $ 211 $ 4,850 $ 2,758 Increase in loss reserve discount 33 (562 ) (81 ) Returned/(additional) premium on loss sensitive business (172 ) (8 ) 118 Net prior year adverse loss development $ 72 $ 4,280 $ 2,795 The decrease in the loss ratio for 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the substantial decrease in the net prior year loss development, net of premiums and loss sensitive premium adjustments in 2011 as shown in the table above and to a lesser extent the improvement in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in the loss ratio was partially offset by the effect of increased catastrophe losses in 2011 compared to 2010. This decrease in the adjusted 2011 loss ratio was partially due to the effect of the Fuji acquisition offset by an increase in the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Specialty Workers Compensation and Excess Casualty business (within the U.S. and Canada region) and the Primary Casualty and Professional Indemnity businesses (within the Europe region). The 2011 net adverse loss development charge of $72 million, primarily relates to the primary casualty, workers compensation, and environmental business lines, partially offset by the net favorable loss development in the financial lines and excess casualty lines. The loss ratio for Chartis increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily as a result of the net adverse loss development for prior accident years recorded in 2010. Approximately 80 percent of the 2010 net prior year adverse loss development charge of $4.3 billion relates to the asbestos, excess casualty, excess workers compensation, and primary workers compensation lines. Further, 83 percent of this charge relates to accident years 2007 and prior (accident years before the financial crisis in 2008) and 65 percent relates to accident years 2005 and prior (accident years prior to the start of the managed reduction in these long tail lines of business). 76 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Most of the 2009 net adverse loss development charge of $2.8 billion relates to excess casualty, excess workers compensation and the asbestos lines of business. Further, approximately 95 percent relates to accident years 2005 and prior. Writings in long tail lines of business that were the drivers of the reserve charges in 2010 and 2009 have been reduced since 2006. In the case of asbestos, since 1985, standard policies have contained an absolute exclusion for asbestos and pollution related damages. The following table presents Chartis catastrophe losses by major event: 2011 2010 Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Commercial Insurance Consumer Insurance Total Commercial Insurance Consumer Insurance Total Event:(a) Tohoku Catastrophe(b) $ 667 $ 524 $ 1,191 $ $ $ New Zealand Christchurch earthquakes 344 7 351 Chile earthquake 289 2 291 Midwest & Southeast U.S. tornadoes 383 14 397 Thailand floods 366 2 368 Hurricane Irene 296 73 369 All other events 525 95 620 711 64 775 Claims and claim expenses 2,581 715 3,296 1,000 66 1,066 Reinstatement premiums 11 11 10 10 Total catastrophe related charges $ 2,592 $ 715 $ 3,307 $ 1,010 $ 66 $ 1,076 (a) Events shown in the above table are catastrophic events, for which the net impact to Chartis is in excess of $200 million each. All other events include 13 events in 2010 and 14 events in 2011 that are considered catastrophic but the net impact of which remains below the $200 million itemization threshold. Catastrophe losses for 2009 are not presented above as there was one significant catastrophe event, flooding in the Southwestern United States, totaling $53 million for Commercial Insurance. (b)On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, triggering a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. This disaster is referred to as the Tohoku Catastrophe. Expense Ratios The expense ratio decreased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the effect of including Fuji results for a full year and the effects of foreign exchange. These decreases were partially offset by Chartis increased investments in a number of strategic initiatives during 2011, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, the implementation of global accounting and claims systems, preparation for Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives. The expense ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to Chartis strategy to continue the enhancement and build out of its financial systems. In addition, during 2010 Chartis recorded increased expenses relating to long term incentive programs that will continue to align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other performance measures. Further, increased acquisition expenses reflect increased regulatory assessments, more specifically in the workers compensation lines, and new marketing agreements with select strategic distribution partners. These increases were partially offset by an overall decline in the expense ratio relating to the acquisition of Fuji.  Chartis Investing and Other Results Chartis manages and accounts for its invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as Chartis Other. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 77 Table of Contents As discussed earlier, investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. See Segment Results Chartis Operations for more information. The following table presents Chartis investing and other results: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Net investment income $ 4,348 $ 4,392 $ 3,292 (1 )% 33 % Net realized capital gains (losses) 587 (49 ) (530 ) NM 91 Bargain purchase gain 332 NM NM Other income (expense) net* (5 ) 669 NM NM Investing and other results $ 4,930 $ 5,344 $ 2,762 (8 )% 93 % * Includes gain on divested properties of $669 million in 2010. 2011 and 2010 Comparison Net investment income: Overall in 2011, net investment income decreased slightly due to declines in private equity and hedge fund income as well as increases in investment expenses. These decreases were largely offset by increases in interest income. The decrease in private equity and hedge fund income reflects the decline in the overall equity markets during the second half of 2011. The increase in investment expenses in 2011 resulted mainly from increases in both internal and external investment management fees. The interest income increase relates to the redeployment of cash and short term instruments into longer term, higher yield securities. In addition, 2011 reflects a full year of interest income related to Fuji, which has been consolidated by Chartis since July 1, 2010. Net realized capital gains (losses): Increases are due to gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities in connection with the strategy discussed above to better align Chartis investment allocations with current overall performance and income tax objectives; a decrease in other than temporary impairment charges; gains from improvements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar; and gains from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, resulting primarily from declining long term interest rates. These derivative instruments economically hedge products that provide benefits over an extended period of time. These gains were partially offset by impairments recognized within other invested assets, primarily life settlement contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, impairment charges of $351 million and $78 million, respectively, were recorded by Chartis related to life settlement contracts, including approximately $38 million and $4 million of impairments, respectively, associated with life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies that are eliminated in consolidation. Life settlement contracts are evaluated for impairment on a contract by contract basis. A contract is identified as potentially impaired if its undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the current carrying value of such contract. Life settlement contracts are impaired, and written down to fair value, when the carrying value of the contract is greater than the estimated fair value. During 2011, Chartis began receiving updated medical information for its life settlement contracts as a result of an enhanced process in which information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individuals health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts, resulting in an increase in the number of contracts identified as potentially impaired when compared to previous analyses. Further, the domestic operations of Chartis refined their fair values based upon the availability of recent medical information. Bargain purchase gain: On March 31, 2010 Chartis purchased additional voting shares in Fuji which resulted in the effective control and consolidation of Fuji. This acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $0.3 billion, which was included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in Other Income. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fujis common stock, which Chartis believes was the result of macro economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fujis financial condition and results of operations. Chartis anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares. 78 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents Other income (expense) net: In May 2009, AIG completed the legal sale of its interest in the Otemachi Building in Japan, including the land and development rights. The transaction initially did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes at that time, due to AIGs continued involvement with the property, which did not end until December 2010. As a result, AIG recognized a gain of approximately $1.3 billion in pre tax income, of which $669 million was included in the Chartis results in 2010. 2010 and 2009 Comparison Net investment income: The increase in 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in the value of partnership investments as market conditions improved in 2010, while 2009 included losses from an equity method investment. Net realized capital losses: Net realized capital losses for Chartis declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities and lower other than temporary impairment charges as market conditions continued to improve. Bargain purchase gain: During 2010, Chartis recognized a bargain purchase gain of $332 million in connection with the acquisition of Fuji. Other income (expense) net: Represents the Chartis portion of the gain on the sale of AIGs Otemachi Building in Japan. See Consolidated Results for further discussion on net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).  Commercial Insurance Commercial Insurance Results The following table presents Commercial Insurance results: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Underwriting results: Net premiums written $ 21,469 $ 20,466 $ 21,461 5 % (5 )% Decrease in unearned premiums 827 1,006 1,645 (18 ) (39 ) Net premiums earned 22,296 21,472 23,106 4 (7 ) Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred 18,953 19,001 18,920 Underwriting expenses 5,847 5,752 5,658 2 2 Underwriting loss (2,504 ) (3,281 ) (1,472 ) 24 (123 ) Net investment income 3,248 3,348 3,883 (3 ) (14 ) Pre tax income $ 744 $ 67 $ 2,411 NM % (97 )% Commercial Insurance Net Premiums Written Commercial Insurance business is transacted in most major foreign currencies.

AIG 2011 Form 10 K 79 Table of Contents 2011 and 2010 Comparison Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: increases in Property lines driven by positive pricing trends and reinsurance modifications resulting in increased retentions; the rate environment for Property has been particularly strong for the U.S. and the Far East region; an increase in additional premiums on Commercial Casualtys loss sensitive business of $164 million compared to 2010. Loss sensitive business relates to policies whose premiums vary with the level of underlying losses. Accordingly, in 2011, additional premiums of $172 million were recognized relating to additional prior year losses. The corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of additional premiums of $8 million; general improvements in rates, in particular for workers compensation; continued growth and market penetration across growth economy nations; and improvements in foreign exchange currency rates. Offsetting these increases was an approximately $0.6 billion decrease in net premiums written relating to the change of certain policy forms at renewal from retrospectively rated premium structures to loss reimbursement deductible structures.  2010 and 2009 Comparison Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: risk management initiatives resulting in the reduction of aggregate exposures in certain Commercial Casualty, Property and Specialty lines of business; lower workers compensation net premiums written due to declining rates, lower employment levels, increased competition and Chartis continued strategy to maintain price discipline; decreases in Financial lines due to declines in various classes of professional liability business, which were negatively affected to a greater extent than other classes by the credit crisis, and Chartis decisions to reduce writings within environmental coverage and not to renew a credit card indemnification program that did not meet internal profitability targets; decreases in Commercial Casualty due to a combination of declines in the construction, real estate and transportation classes and limited availability of capital for new projects, which impacted general liability and commercial umbrella business. These were offset by improved pricing, increased new business submissions and improved retention resulting from increased stabilization of developed economies after the financial crisis that began in 2008; and effects of three year reinsurance agreements, secured through catastrophe bonds, which provided protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes, and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $208 million. 80 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Commercial Insurance Underwriting Ratios The following table presents the Commercial Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss sensitive contracts on the Commercial Insurance consolidated loss and combined ratios: (Increase) (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Loss ratio 85.0 88.5 81.9 (3.5 ) 6.6 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (11.6 ) (4.7 ) (0.2 ) (6.9 ) (4.5 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount 0.3 (10.2 ) (6.7 ) 10.5 (3.5 ) Loss ratio, as adjusted 73.7 73.6 75.0 0.1 (1.4 ) Expense ratio 26.2 26.8 24.5 (0.6 ) 2.3 Combined ratio 111.2 115.3 106.4 (4.1 ) 8.9 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (11.6 ) (4.7 ) (0.2 ) (6.9 ) (4.5 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount 0.3 (10.2 ) (6.7 ) 10.5 (3.5 ) Combined ratio, adjusted 99.9 100.4 99.5 (0.5 ) 0.9 The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Commercial Insurance: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross prior year adverse loss development $ 98 $ 2,594 $ 1,536 Increase in loss reserve discount (40 ) (400 ) (81 ) Returned (additional) premium on loss sensitive business (172 ) (8 ) 118 Net prior year adverse (favorable) loss development $ (114 ) $ 2,186 $ 1,573 Loss Ratios The loss ratio improved in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the effect of net prior year adverse loss development in 2010 and an increase in additional premiums from loss sensitive business in 2011. These items were largely offset by the increase in catastrophe losses in 2011. The loss ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the net prior year adverse loss development in 2010 for the excess casualty and workers compensation lines of business. For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section that follows.  Expense Ratios The expense ratio improved in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and overall growth in the business. In addition, the expense ratio reflects the effects of continued enhancements to regional governance, risk management capabilities and investments within growth economy nations. The expense ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a change in the mix of business from low commission casualty business to higher commission property business. In addition, the increase in general operating expenses reflects Chartis strategy to continue the enhancement and build out of its financial systems. Further, during 2010, Chartis recorded increased expenses relating to long term incentive programs that will continue to align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other performance measures AIG 2011 Form 10 K 81 Table of Contents  Consumer Insurance Consumer Insurance Results The following table presents Consumer Insurance results: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Underwriting results: Net premiums written $ 13,341 $ 11,056 $ 9,096 21 % 22 % Increase in unearned premiums (17 ) (97 ) (41 ) 82 (137 ) Net premiums earned 13,324 10,959 9,055 22 21 Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred 8,797 6,686 5,315 32 26 Underwriting expenses 4,857 4,171 3,690 16 13 Underwriting profit (loss) (330 ) 102 50 NM 104 Net investment income 354 301 351 18 (14 ) Pre tax income $ 24 $ 403 $ 401 (94 )% % Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written  2011 and 2010 comparison Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the effect of including Fuji results for a full year, the improvement in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen, and further growth in the strategic higher value lines of business. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased 3 percent in 2011, primarily due to: A&H net premiums written increased by approximately 10 percent. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, A&H net premiums written increased by approximately seven percent primarily as a result of the execution of Chartis growth strategies in key lines and the effect of foreign exchange. The Far East region continued to implement favorable marketing programs and benefited from rate increases implemented in 2010. Growth was also demonstrated in key geographic markets such as Asia Pacific, including China, EMEA, including Continental Europe, and Israel, and in targeted areas, such as direct marketing and travel insurance. Personal Lines net premiums written increased by approximately 25 percent. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Personal Lines net premiums decreased one percent, primarily as a result of Chartis decisions to not renew certain programs in the U.S. and Canada region that did not meet performance targets. Personal Lines continued to grow in key markets, including Japan and Latin America and in key lines, such as specialized personal lines products. Life net premiums written increased primarily as a result of the full year effect of the Fuji acquisition and as a result of the execution of new business strategies at Fuji Life Insurance Company Ltd.  2010 and 2009 comparison Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of Fuji. 82 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Consumer Insurance is transacted in most major foreign currencies.

Consumer Insurance Underwriting Ratios The following table presents the Consumer Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss sensitive contracts on the Consumer Insurance consolidated loss and combined ratios: Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Loss ratio 66.0 61.0 58.7 5.0 2.3 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (5.3 ) (0.6 ) (4.7 ) (0.6 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount (0.7 ) 0.6 (0.8 ) (1.3 ) 1.4 Loss ratio, as adjusted 60.0 61.0 57.9 (1.0 ) 3.1 Expense ratio 36.5 38.1 40.8 (1.6 ) (2.7 ) Combined ratio 102.5 99.1 99.5 3.4 (0.4 ) Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums (5.3 ) (0.6 ) (4.7 ) (0.6 ) Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount (0.7 ) 0.6 (0.8 ) (1.3 ) 1.4 Combined ratio, adjusted 96.5 99.1 98.7 (2.6 ) 0.4 The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Consumer Insurance: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross prior year adverse (favorable) loss development $ 86 $ (66 ) $ 75 Net prior year adverse (favorable) loss development $ 86 $ (66 ) $ 75 Loss Ratios The loss ratio increased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses in 2011. During 2011, Consumer Insurance recorded net prior year adverse loss development of $86 million, primarily due to programs in the U.S. and Canada region that are not being renewed. This compares to net prior year favorable loss development of $66 million in 2010. The increase in the loss ratio in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects the effect of Fuji in 2010 and increased claims in Japan and Europe. In 2010, Consumer Insurance recorded favorable net prior year loss development of $66 million primarily due to favorable development in the Asia Pacific region. This compares to net prior year adverse loss development in 2009 of $75 million primarily due to reserve development in Japan and Latin America. For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section that follows. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 83 Table of Contents  Expense Ratios The expense ratio decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the effects of including Fuji results for a full year. Fuji has a lower average expense ratio than the rest of the Consumer Insurance business due in part to its business mix. The expense ratio decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the net benefit from Fuji net deferred acquisition costs, which were capitalized subsequent to the Fuji acquisition.

The excess workers compensation line of business is subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of the underlying policy) and, as a result, Chartis Other will reflect the effects of premium audit activity through subsequent years. Given the run off nature of the legacy lines of business and the nature of the expenses included in Chartis Other, management has determined that traditional underwriting measures of loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio do not provide an appropriate measure of underwriting performance. Therefore, underwriting ratios are not presented for Chartis Other. 2011 and 2010 Comparison For the year 2011 compared to 2010, the decrease in net premiums written and claims and claim adjustment expenses reflect the effects of the run off activities associated with the excess workers compensation business, 84 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents while the underwriting expenses increased as a result of certain expenses related to corporate initiatives and expense allocations of AIG Parent. 2010 and 2009 Comparison For the year 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred relates to net prior year adverse loss development in 2010. The overall increase in underwriting expenses relates to increases for strategic Chartis initiatives, including global accounting and claims system implementations, Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives. For a discussion of Investing and other results for Chartis Other, see Chartis Results Chartis Investing and Other Results.  Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for Chartis as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in AIGs Other operations category. The following table presents the components of AIGs gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory basis*: At December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Other liability occurrence $ 22,526 $ 23,583 International 17,726 16,583 Workers compensation 17,420 17,683 Other liability claims made 11,216 11,446 Property 6,165 3,846 Auto liability 3,081 3,337 Mortgage guaranty credit 3,046 4,220 Products liability 2,416 2,377 Medical malpractice 1,690 1,754 Accident and health 1,553 1,444 Commercial multiple peril 1,134 1,006 Aircraft 1,020 1,149 Fidelity/surety 786 934 Other 1,366 1,789 Total $ 91,145 $ 91,151 * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. AIGs gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 85 Table of Contents The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Chartis: Commercial Insurance $ 58,625 $ 57,324 Consumer Insurance 5,362 5,030 Other* 3,992 5,720 Total Chartis 67,979 68,074 Other operations Mortgage Guaranty 2,846 3,433 Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of $ 70,825 $ 71,507 * In 2011, the net loss reserves reflect the cession under the June 17, 2011 transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO) of $1.7 billion. See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense Asbestos and Environmental Reserve for additional discussion of the NICO transaction.  Discounting of Reserves At December 31, 2011, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.18 billion, including tabular and non tabular calculations. The tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Beginning in 2011, a portion of these discounted reserves were ceded to a new Pennsylvania domiciled AIG subsidiary. However, this had no impact on the calculation of the overall discount. Certain other asbestos business that was written by Chartis is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount consists of the following: $777 million tabular discount for workers compensation in the U.S. and Canada operations of Chartis and $2.32 billion non tabular discount for workers compensation in the U.S. and Canada operations of Chartis; and $88 million non tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.  Results of the Reserving Process AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of December 31, 2011. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2011. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analysis to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in 2011 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for that period. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market. See Chartis Results herein and Other Operations Other Operations Results Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development. Net Loss Development by Class of Business The following is a discussion of the primary reasons for the development in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of those classes of business that experienced significant prior accident year developments during the three year period. See Asbestos and Environmental Reserves below for a further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves and development on pre 1985 exposures. 88 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Excess Casualty  Excess Casualty Background Loss reserves pertaining to the excess casualty class of business are generally included in the other liability occurrence line of business, with a small portion of the excess casualty reserves included in the Other liability claims made line of business, as presented in the loss reserves by major lines of business table above. Excess Casualty reserves experienced favorable development in calendar year 2011 and significant adverse loss development in 2010 and 2009.  Excess Casualty Discussion and Analysis During calendar year 2011 the Excess Casualty business segment experienced better than expected loss emergence, based on expected emergence using the shorter termed development pattern from the year end 2010 reserve analysis noted below. Accident years 2009 and prior exhibited actual emergence approximately 20 percent better than expected during 2011, while accident year 2010 experienced some large catastrophic losses causing its results to be worse than expected. The loss development pattern used in the year end 2011 reserve analysis was based on a shorter termed average of approximately three years, consistent with 2010. This pattern, coupled with the better than expected emergence seen during the year, resulted in the estimated ultimate losses improving by approximately $273 million for this class of business, when compared to the year end 2010 estimates. The accident year contribution to this improvement is adverse development of $225 million in accident year 2010 offset by favorable development of $62 million to accident year 2009, $163 million to accident year 2008, $90 million to accident year 2007, $115 million to accident year 2006, $40 million to accident year 2005, and $29 million for accident years 2004 and prior in the aggregate. The increase in loss costs driving this development in 2009 and 2010 resulted primarily from medical inflation, which increased the economic loss component of tort claims; advances in medical care, which extended the life span of severely injured claimants; and larger jury verdicts, which increased the value of severe tort claims. AIG increased its estimate for its year end 2009 loss reserve for excess casualty liabilities by more than $1 billion, primarily relating to accident years 2006 and prior. The majority of the 2009 charge resulted from managements decision to place greater reliance on the experience of the five most recent calendar years, resulting in significantly higher loss development factor assumptions for the year end 2009 loss reserve review. For the year end 2009 loss reserve review, in response to significantly higher than expected loss emergence, AIG reviewed the indicated reserves for excess casualty under a variety of loss development assumptions. These assumptions ranged from long term loss development averages, which used all or nearly all of the historical data for this class, to short term averages which used only the latest three to five calendar years of loss development experience. AIG gave greater recognition to the recent calendar year experience, resulting in significantly higher loss development factor assumptions for the year end 2009 loss reserve review. This change in loss development assumptions increased the excess casualty reserves by approximately $815 million for accident years 2006 and prior. Additionally, in conjunction with the selection of higher loss development factors described above, AIG assigned greater credibility to the emerging loss development factors for product aggregate related claims, which are reviewed separately. This resulted in an increase of approximately $195 million in reserves, primarily for accident years 2000 and prior. Even with these higher loss development factors, during the fourth quarter of 2010, loss emergence across all accident years for excess casualty was approximately $115 million worse than expected and was concentrated in accident years 2007 and 2008. The concentration of such losses in more recent accident years resulted in much higher loss estimates at year end 2010 because the experience is extrapolated not only for these years, but to all years through the application of the loss development factors. The higher than expected loss emergence in the last half of 2010, particularly in the fourth quarter, led management to select higher loss development factors than those selected in 2009 because greater weight was placed on the adverse development in the recent calendar years (i.e., the three most recent calendar years). In these low frequency/high severity classes of business, AIG applied significant judgment to select an appropriate averaging period for loss development that is long enough to be statistically credible while recognizing changing trends in a sufficiently responsive manner. AIG also considered recent trends in large products liability verdicts in the United States given the impact of the recession and the AIG 2011 Form 10 K 89 Table of Contents impact of anti corporate sentiment in the mind of the general public, as well as the high attachment points at which this business is written. This change from basing the loss development factor assumptions on the last five years provides still greater recognition of the recent calendar year experience than the assumptions used in the 2009 loss reserve review, and in managements judgment was warranted based on the developing trends described above. Approximately $80 million of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010 pertained to accident year 2009, whereas approximately $200 million was attributable to accident year 2008, $340 million to accident year 2007, $195 million to accident year 2006, $100 million to accident years 1999 and prior, and approximately $95 million in the aggregate to accident years 2000 through 2005. Excess Workers Compensation  Excess Workers Compensation Background: This class of business has an extremely long tail and is one of the most challenging classes of business to reserve for because it is highly sensitive to small changes in assumptions in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured workers, for example which can have a significant effect on the ultimate reserve estimate. Furthermore claims estimates for this line are highly sensitive to: the assumed future rate of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States; changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment; the expected impact of recently enacted health care reform on workers compensation costs; underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions; claims settlement trends that can materially alter the mix and ultimate cost of claims; changes in claims reporting practices of insureds and third party administrators; the cost of new and additional treatment specialties, such as "pain management"; changes in injured worker longevity; and territorial experience differences (across states and within regions in a state). There was no material development recognized for this class in 2011. AIG experienced significant adverse development for this class during 2010 and 2009 of $825 million and $925 million, respectively.  Excess Workers Compensation Discussion and Analysis With the passage of the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, management concluded that there is increased vulnerability to the risk of further cost shifting to the excess workers compensation class of business in particular. Settlement efforts can also be affected by changes to evaluation protocols implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2009, which are expected to result in future prescription drug costs being borne by workers compensation insurers to a significantly greater degree than in the past and thus likely to lead to further deteriorating trends for the excess workers compensation class of business. In addition, approximately 20 percent of the reported claims emanate from excess of loss reinsurance contracts provided by Chartis to other third party insurers in accident years 2002 and prior. These reinsurance contracts generally include the so called "follow the fortunes clause" whereby claims management is performed by the ceding insurers and the outcomes of these efforts are binding on Chartis as the reinsurer. Chartis has virtually no ability to affect the outcomes of these claims. Moreover, underwriting actions in recent years have led to a significant increase in insured retention levels, which reduce the frequency of moderate severity losses but extend the time period of first report of claim, causing further unpredictability in loss development patterns. 90 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG conducted its comprehensive loss reserve analysis using a variety of actuarial techniques to project future loss development for this very long tail class. As part of this analysis, AIG compared and contrasted the traditional techniques that have been used for this class with an alternative approach that focuses more explicitly on projecting the effect of future calendar year trends, placing less weight on prior period loss development ratios due to the increased evidence of changes to the claims environment. To this end, AIG engaged a third party actuary that uses such alternative approaches to supplement the extensive analysis performed by AIG as it conducted its comprehensive loss review of its year end loss reserves. The third party actuary provided an additional perspective for the excess workers compensation class by using a method that management considered to be particularly suited to the excess workers compensation class, given its long tail nature. These various actuarial analyses all indicated a substantial increase in loss estimates from the prior year level. AIG responded to this increased loss indication by evaluating a range of loss development scenarios including developing the tail factors that extrapolate the claims projections as far as 40 years into the future. Due to the extremely long tail nature of this class, the impact of the selected change in loss development assumptions affected many accident years and led to an overall strengthening of approximately $825 million, before discount. Approximately $430 million of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010 pertained to accident years 1999 and prior, with an additional $160 million attributable to accident year 2000, $140 million to accident year 2001, $80 million to accident year 2002, and only approximately $10 million attributable to 2003 and subsequent years. For the year end 2009 loss reserve review, AIG increased the loss development assumptions for this class of business, resulting in approximately a $925 million increase in reserves. The increased loss development assumptions were based on an additional actuarial study performed by AIG in response to the emergence of losses in accident years 1999 and prior. This study analyzed the development patterns emanating from the AIG claims staff projections of expected ultimate cost for each open claim. Director and Officer (D&O) and Related Management Liability Classes of Business  D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business Background Loss reserves pertaining to D&O and related management liability classes of business are included in the Other liability claims made line of business, as presented in the loss reserves by major lines of business table above. AIG experienced favorable development in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The favorable development over the three year period related primarily to accident years 2005 2007, 2010, and, to a lesser extent, accident years 2001 and 2002.  D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business Discussion and Analysis Loss cost trends for D&O and related management liability classes of business were adverse in accident years 2002 and prior due to a variety of factors, including an increase in frequency and severity of corporate bankruptcies; the increase in the frequency of financial restatements; the sharp rise in market capitalization of publicly traded companies; and the increase in the number of initial public offerings. The 2003 through 2006 period was marked by a significant reduction in claims related to these factors; thus the expected loss ratios initially established for these accident years have developed favorably, particularly for 2004 and 2005. Beginning in accident year 2007, claims relating to the credit crisis resulted in increased overall claim activity. This increase in claim activity began to subside for accident years 2008 and subsequent, with a reduction in credit crisis related claim activity and a decrease in the higher severity securities class action claims in the more recent accident years. AIG utilizes ground up claims projections by AIG claims staff as a benchmark to select the loss reserves for this business; these projections are updated annually. For the year end 2011 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries took into account the favorable development for accident years 2011, 2010 and 2003 through 2008 as well as the continuing favorable development observed in the ground up claim projections by AIG claims staff over the past five years. This favorable development was partially offset by adverse development for accident year 2009. For the year end 2010 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries took into account the favorable development from prior accident years, as well as the continuing favorable development observed in the ground up claims projections AIG 2011 Form 10 K 91 Table of Contents by AIG claims staff over the past five years. This favorable development was partially offset by higher than expected initial claim projections for accident year 2009. For the year end 2009 loss reserve review, AIGs actuaries took into account the favorable development for accident years 2007 and prior, as well as adverse development from accident year 2008. In response to the emerging favorable development observed in the ground up claims projections by AIG claims staff over the past several years, AIG considered both the higher than expected initial claim projections for accident year 2008 as well as the favorable developments for the claims projections from the earlier accident years in determining the loss ratio for accident year 2009. Healthcare Background and Discussion and Analysis Healthcare business written by the U.S. and Canada region of Chartis produced moderate favorable developments in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Healthcare loss reserves have benefited from favorable market conditions and an improved legal environment in accident years 2002 and subsequent, following a period of adverse loss trends and market conditions that began in the mid 1990s. Primary Workers Compensation (Commercial Risks, Commercial Specialty Workers Compensation and Energy)  Primary (Specialty) Workers Compensation Background The Commercial Risk division writes casualty insurance accounts with revenues less than $700 million. The majority of the business is workers compensation. The Energy division writes casualty insurance accounts in the mining, oil and gas and power generation sectors. The Commercial Specialty Workers Compensation division writes small monoline guaranteed cost risks. AIGs Commercial Specialty Workers Compensation business unit grew significantly in the early to mid 2000s but has reduced its premium writings by nearly 70 percent since 2007. A total of $518 million of adverse loss development was recorded for Commercial Specialty Workers Compensation in 2010. Significant improvements in claims handling, which had the effect of accelerating claims recognition (without increasing overall loss costs), were believed to be the cause of the earlier emergence of claims. However, the adverse loss emergence during 2010 led AIG to conclude that the worsening experience was attributable to a credible upward trend in the emergence of losses, rather than claims handling. AIGs conclusion that the worsening experience necessitated a strengthening of the reserves was confirmed by an independent third party actuarial review during the fourth quarter of 2010. Approximately 75 percent of the year end 2010 reserve strengthening for this business pertained to accident years 2007 through 2009. Similarly, Commercial Risks strengthened workers compensation reserves in 2010, as the adverse loss emergence led AIG to conclude that the worsening experience was attributable to an upward trend in the emergence of losses, rather than to claims handling. This was further confirmed by an independent third party review.  Primary Workers Compensation Discussion and Analysis The Commercial Risk, Commercial Specialty Workers Compensation and Energy divisions contributed $265 million, $145 million and $115 million, respectively, of adverse development in calendar year 2011. The vast majority of this adverse development emanates from primary workers compensation exposure and the vast majority of the workers compensation adverse development comes from accident year 2010. In 2011, losses for accident year 2010 continued to emerge at higher levels than anticipated by the loss ratios established at prior year end. A key structural driver was the effect of high unemployment on the frequency of higher severity lost time claims. The economic environment diminished the opportunities of employers to offer "light duty" return to work mitigation strategies. In addition, AIG continues to see the effect of rising medical costs from the deployment of pain management strategies. The increase in lost time frequency and the adverse effects of medical cost trends has resulted in higher loss ratios than anticipated at prior year end. For each of the three sub segments, AIGs conclusion that the worsening experience necessitated a strengthening of the reserves was confirmed by an independent third party actuarial review during 2011. 92 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Environmental  Environmental Background and Discussion and Analysis Chartis maintains an active environmental insurance business written through its Chartis Environmental business unit. The reserves associated with this units business are evaluated and reported separately from the asbestos and environmental reserves associated with standard General Liability and Umbrella policies discussed in "Asbestos and Environmental Reserves". The following discussion relates solely to the Chartis Environmental reserves. The estimation of loss reserves relating to environmental claims is subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. Reinsurance balances can also be subject to a higher level of disputes and legal collection activity, given the complex nature of coverage issues. Historically, Chartis actuaries have used traditional actuarial methods, such as loss development, Bornhuetter Ferguson, and indexing methods to assess the reserves for the Chartis Environmental products. However, recent emerging claims activity has led Chartis to conclude that these traditional actuarial methods do not address to its satisfaction the unique nature of the underlying exposures enough for those environmental policies with large ultimate loss potential (greater than $5 million per policy) and high policy limits. Chartis Environmental strengthened its reserves in the first nine months of 2011 by $217 million, partly due to large reserve increases on individual claims. Consequently, an in depth ground up review of the existing exposures was conducted by actuaries and claims analysts. As a result of this claim review as well as other factors, Chartis strengthened the reserves by an additional $196 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Approximately 80 percent of the 2011 development was associated with accident years 2003 and prior. In addition to reserving actions, Chartis has made significant changes to the Chartis Environmental business with the goal of ensuring that the current policies are being written to earn an appropriate risk adjusted profit. Underwriting guidelines have been revised to no longer cover known or expected clean up costs, which were a significant driver of historical claims, and a "new emerging contaminants" team has been formed within the dedicated environmental engineering staff to track any new cleanup standards that may be set by federal or state regulators. The percentage of long term policies (ten years or more) has decreased from a historical average of 6 percent to 1.5 percent by policy count. In addition, minimum retentions have been increased, and engineering reviews are required for specific business segments (such as oil and gas, and landfills) that have traditionally generated higher losses. See Chartis Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.  Overview of Loss Reserving Process Chartis loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. One group is short tail classes of business consisting principally of property, personal lines and certain casualty classes. The other group is long tail casualty classes of business which includes excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes. Short Tail Reserves For operations writing short tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserves is generally geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums, and this level of reserve would generally be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor would be adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 93 Table of Contents Long Tail Reserves Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty classes of business shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller percentage would be net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses. AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty classes of business. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms, current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. A number of actuarial assumptions are generally made in the review of reserves for each class of business. For longer tail classes of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following: Loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2011 for the year end 2011 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many Chartis classes of business. The overall change in AIGs loss reserves is based on the sum of these classes of business changes. For most long tail classes of business, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the current accident quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter.  Details of the Loss Reserving Process The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; and actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business reflects input from actuarial, underwriting and claims staff and is intended to represent managements best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the factors described above. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors 94 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive loss reserve review is conducted annually for each Chartis subsidiary. During 2011 AIG significantly expanded the scope of its third party actuarial reviews to cover a larger number of U.S. and international classes of business from the more complex reserves of long tail classes of business. These reviews were concluded in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2011. In 2010, third party actuarial reserve reviews were generally limited to certain U.S. long tail lines of business and were concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2010. These detailed reviews are conducted for each class of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the appropriateness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and therefore of AIGs overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews an actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these central estimates for each class of business for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers both the internal actuarial central estimate and numerous other internal and external factors including an assessment of economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling, as well as third party actuarial reviews that are periodically performed for key classes of business. Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements. Actuarial Methods for Major Classes of Business In testing the reserves for each class of business, a determination is made by AIGs actuaries as to the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. Other factors considered include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, AIG writes a great number of unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for professional liability, it is appropriate to combine the subclasses into larger groups. The greater degree of credibility in the claims experience of the larger groups may outweigh the greater degree of homogeneity of the individual subclasses. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most robust estimate of the loss reserves. Actuarial methods used by AIG for most long tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods, including "Bornhuetter Ferguson" methods described below. Other methods considered include frequency/severity methods, although these are generally used by AIG more for pricing analysis than for loss reserve analysis. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. Expected loss ratio methods are generally used by AIG where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long tail classes at early stages of loss development. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 95 Table of Contents Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss expense would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. "Bornhuetter Ferguson" methods are expected loss ratio methods for which the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the "Bornhuetter Ferguson" method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the "Bornhuetter Ferguson" method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses. A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged for the expected loss ratio to be modified to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if in fact the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as "Bornhuetter Ferguson" have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year. AIGs loss reserve reviews for long tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required in order to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next. Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto. AIG also utilizes these methods in pricing subclasses of professional liability. 96 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents  The following is a discussion of actuarial methods applied by major class of business: Class of Business or Category and Actuarial Method Application of Actuarial Method Excess Casualty AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess casualty classes. Frequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation as the vast majority of reported claims do not result in a claim payment. In addition, the average severity varies significantly from accident year to accident year due to large losses which characterize this class of business, as well as changing proportions of claims which do not result in a claim payment. Expected loss ratio methods are generally used for at least the three latest accident years, due to the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss experience is generally reviewed separately for lead umbrella classes and for other excess classes, due to the relatively shorter tail for lead umbrella business. Automobile related claims are generally reviewed separately from non auto claims, due to the shorter tail nature of the automobile related claims. Claims relating to certain latent exposures such as construction defects or exhaustion of underlying product aggregate limits are reviewed separately due to the unique emergence patterns of losses relating to these claims. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios of prior years, adjusted for rate changes, estimated loss cost trends and all other changes that can be quantified. D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for D&O and related management liability classes of business. Frequency/severity methods are generally not used in isolation for these classes as the overall losses are driven by large losses more than by claim frequency. Severity trends have varied significantly from accident year to accident year and care is required in analyzing these trends by claim type. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight in the two most recent accident years, whereas loss development methods are given more weight in more mature accident years. In addition to these traditional actuarial methods, AIGs actuaries used ground up claim projections provided by AIG claims staff as a benchmark for determining the indicated ultimate losses for all accident years other than the most recent accident year. For the year end 2011 loss reserve review, claims projections for accident years 2010 and prior were used. These classes of business reflect claims made coverage, and losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity. Thus, the claim projections can produce an overall indicator of the ultimate loss exposure for these classes by identifying and estimating all large losses. Workers Compensation AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for workers compensation. Expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers compensation claims are generally characterized by high frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next. AIG historically has been a leading writer of workers compensation, and thus has sufficient volume of claims experience to use development methods. AIG generally segregates California business from other business in evaluating workers compensation reserves. Certain classes of workers compensation, such as construction, are also evaluated separately. Additionally, AIG writes a number of very large accounts which include workers compensation coverage. These accounts are generally priced by AIG actuaries, and to the extent appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis may be used to record the initial estimated loss reserves for these accounts. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 97 Table of Contents Class of Business or Category and Actuarial Method Application of Actuarial Method Excess Workers Compensation AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers compensation. Loss development methods are given the greater weight for mature accident years. Expected loss ratio methods are given the greater weight for the more recent accident years. Excess workers compensation is an extremely long tail class of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. Therefore there is limited credibility in the reported losses for many of the more recent accident years. For the mature accident years, AIGs actuaries use claims projections provided by AIG claims staff to help determine the loss development factors for this class of business. General Liability AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for primary general liability or products liability classes. For certain classes of business with sufficient loss volume, loss development methods may be given significant weight for all but the most recent one or two accident years, whereas for smaller or more volatile classes of business, loss development methods may be given limited weight for the five or more most recent accident years. Expected loss ratio methods would be used for the more recent accident years for these classes. The loss experience for primary general liability business is generally reviewed at a level that is believed to provide the most appropriate data for reserve analysis. For example, primary claims made business is generally segregated from business written on an occurrence policy form. Additionally, certain subclasses, such as construction, are generally reviewed separately from business in other subclasses. For example, in the case of environmental liability, AIGs actuaries use claim projections provided by AIG claims staff for long duration policies. Due to the fairly long tail nature of general liability business, and the many subclasses that are reviewed individually, there is less credibility in the reported losses and increased reliance on expected loss ratio methods. Commercial Automobile Liability AIG generally uses loss development methods for all but the most recent accident year for commercial automobile classes of business. Expected loss ratio methods are generally given significant weight only in the most recent accident year. Healthcare AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for healthcare classes of business. Frequency/severity methods are sometimes used for pricing certain healthcare accounts or business. However, in testing loss reserves the business is generally combined into larger groupings to enhance the credibility of the loss experience. The frequency/severity methods that are applicable in pricing may not be appropriate for reserve testing. The largest component of the healthcare business consists of coverage written for hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Reserves for excess coverage are tested separately from those for primary coverage. For primary coverages, loss development methods are generally given the majority of the weight for all but the latest three accident years, and are given some weight for all years other than the latest accident year. For excess coverages, expected loss methods are generally given all the weight for the latest three accident years, and are also given considerable weight for accident years prior to the latest three years. For other classes of healthcare coverage, an analogous weighting between loss development and expected loss ratio methods is used. The weights assigned to each method are those that are believed to result in the best combination of responsiveness and stability. 98 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Class of Business or Category and Actuarial Method Application of Actuarial Method Professional Liability AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for professional liability classes of business. Frequency/severity methods are used in pricing and profitability analyses for some classes of professional liability; however, for loss reserve testing, the need to enhance credibility generally results in classes that are not sufficiently homogenous to utilize frequency/severity methods. Loss development methods are used for the more mature accident years. Greater weight is given to expected loss ratio methods in the more recent accident years. Reserves are tested separately for claims made classes and classes written on occurrence policy forms. Further segmentations are made in a manner believed to provide an appropriate balance between credibility and homogeneity of the data. Catastrophic Casualty AIG uses expected loss ratio methods for all accident years for catastrophic casualty business. This class of business consists of casualty or financial lines coverage that attach in excess of very high attachment points; thus the claims experience is marked by very low frequency and high severity. Because of the limited number of claims, loss development methods are not used. The expected loss ratios and loss development assumptions used are based upon the results of prior accident years for this business as well as for similar classes of business written above lower attachment points. The business is generally written on a claims made basis. AIG uses ground up claim projections provided by AIG claims staff to assist in developing the appropriate reserve. Aviation AIG generally uses a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation exposures. Aviation claims are not very long tail in nature; however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination of both development and expected loss ratio methods are used for all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves. Frequency/severity methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the claims and different mix of claims from year to year. Expected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss reserves for the latest accident year. Personal Auto (Domestic) AIG generally uses frequency/severity methods and loss development methods for domestic personal auto classes. For many classes of business, greater reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto and allow for more immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to industry and other diagnostic metrics. Fidelity/Surety AIG generally uses loss development methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident year. For surety exposures, AIG generally uses the same method as for short tail classes (discussed below). Expected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the more recent accident years, and for the latest accident year they may be given 100 percent weight. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 99 Table of Contents Class of Business or Category and Actuarial Method Application of Actuarial Method Mortgage Guaranty AIG tests mortgage guaranty reserves using loss development methods, supplemented by an internal claim analysis by actuaries and staff who specialize in the mortgage guaranty business. The reserve analysis projects ultimate losses for claims within each of several categories of delinquency based on actual historical experience, using primarily a frequency/severity loss development approach. Additional reserve tests are also employed, such as tests measuring losses as a percent of risk in force. Reserves are reviewed separately for each line of business considering the loss development characteristics, volume of claim data available and applicability of various actuarial methods to each line. Held reserves for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses are established for reported mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based upon historical reporting trends. AIG establishes held reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability (for each delinquent loan reported) that is based upon projected claim experience for each category of delinquency, consistent in total with the overall reserve estimate. Mortgage Guaranty losses and loss adjustment expenses have been adversely affected by macroeconomic events, such as declining home prices and increasing unemployment, among other events, related to the turmoil in the financial markets. Because these macroeconomic events are subject to adverse or favorable change, the determination of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses requires a high degree of judgment. Responding to these adverse macroeconomic influences, numerous government and lender loan modification programs have been implemented to mitigate mortgage losses. The loan modification programs have produced additional cures of delinquent loans in 2011 that may not continue in 2012 as some modification programs are phased out or retired. In addition, these loan modifications may re default resulting in new losses for Mortgage Guaranty. Occurrences of fraudulent loans, underwriting violations, and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly related to the 2006 and 2007 blocks of business, have resulted in historically high levels of claim rescissions and denials (collectively referred to as rescissions) during 2011. As a result, many lenders have increased their rescission appeals activity as well as the success rate on those appeals by focusing additional resources on the process. The increased lender attention on tracking down missing loan documents along with the heightened focus on appeals of rescissions caused the estimated ultimate rescission rate (net of appeals) assumed in the loss reserves to be lower than the rescission level experienced in 2010. If this trend continues it may unfavorably affect future results. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans, consistent with industry practices. 100 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Class of Business or Category and Actuarial Method Application of Actuarial Method Short Tail Classes AIG generally uses either loss development methods or IBNR factor methods to set reserves for short tail classes such as property coverages. Where a factor is used, it generally represents a percent of earned premium or other exposure measure. The factor is determined based on prior accident year experience. For example, the IBNR for a class of property coverage might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premium. The factor is continually reevaluated in light of emerging claim experience as well as rate changes or other factors that could affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed. International Business written by Chartis internationally includes both long tail and short tail classes of business. For long tail classes of business, the actuarial methods used are analogous to those described above. However, the majority of business written by Chartis internationally is short tail, high frequency and low severity in nature. For this business, loss development methods are generally employed to test the loss reserves. AIG maintains a database of detailed historical premium and loss transactions in original currency for business written by Chartis internationally, thereby allowing AIG actuaries to determine the current reserves without any distortion from changes in exchange rates over time. In testing the Chartis operations, AIGs actuaries segment the data by region, country or class of business as appropriate to determine an optimal balance between homogeneity and credibility. Loss Adjustment Expenses AIG determines reserves for legal defense and cost containment loss adjustment expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial methods. The methods generally include development methods analogous to those described for loss development methods. The developments could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar classes of business. AIG generally determines reserves for adjuster loss adjustment expenses based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular class of business. AIG generally determines reserves for other unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on the ratio of the calendar year expenses paid to overall losses paid. This determination is generally done for all classes of business combined, and reflects costs of home office claim overhead as a percent of losses paid. Catastrophes Special analyses are conducted by AIG in response to major catastrophes in order to estimate AIGs gross and net loss and loss expense liability from those events. These analyses may include a combination of approaches, including modeling estimates, ground up claim analysis, loss evaluation reports from on site field adjusters, and market share estimates. AIGs loss reserve analyses do not provide a range of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss reserves from Chartis business relates to longer tail casualty classes of business driven by severity rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O, AIG believes that developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. Using the reserving methodologies described above, AIGs actuaries determine their best estimate of the required reserve and advise management of that amount. An important part of AIGs internal governance process over the establishment of loss reserves is the Reserve Review Committee. This multi disciplinary committee is comprised of senior actuarial, finance, claims, risk management and business unit executives throughout the organization. The purpose of the Reserve Review Committee is to provide oversight, policy establishment and guidance to the reserving process and, when deemed necessary, to adjust the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses to an amount that is different than the amounts recommended by the actuaries. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 101 Table of Contents For a discussion of the sensitivity analysis on the reserve for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, see Critical Accounting Estimates Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense (Chartis and Mortgage Guaranty) herein.  Asbestos and Environmental Reserves The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. As such, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. The current Chartis Environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the analysis. See discussion on Chartis Environmental reserves herein for further discussion. The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case by case basis. On June 17, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the bulk of Chartis net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO as part of Chartis ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S. related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis subsidiaries. Upon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis ceded the bulk of its net domestic asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. The aggregate limit includes NICOs assumption of collection risk for existing third party reinsurance recoverable associated with these liabilities. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net U.S. asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into income over the settlement period of the underlying claims. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties from liability. 102 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency could have an adverse effect on AIGs future results of operations for an individual reporting period. With respect to known environmental claims, AIG established over two decades ago a specialized environmental claims unit, which investigates and adjusts all such environmental claims. This unit evaluates these environmental claims utilizing a claim by claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally evaluates exposure on a policy by policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information. In the environmental claims unit, AIG actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG attempts to mitigate its known long tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, when appropriate, litigation. Similarly, with respect to known asbestos claims, AIG established over two decades ago a specialized toxic tort claims unit, which historically investigated and adjusted all such asbestos claims. As part of the above mentioned NICO transaction, effective January 1, 2011, NICO assumed responsibility for claims handling related to the majority of AIGs domestic asbestos liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2010, management conducted its more in depth comprehensive loss reserve review with the assistance of its third party actuary. The more in depth study to determine the appropriate loss reserve estimate for its asbestos exposures includes a series of top down and ground up reserve analyses. To ensure it has the most comprehensive analysis possible, AIG engages an independent third party actuarial firm to assist in assessing these exposures. The third party actuarial firms ground up study uses a proprietary model to calculate the loss exposure on an insured by insured basis. Management believes that the accuracy of the reserve estimate is greatly enhanced through the combination of the third party actuarial firms industry modeling techniques and industry knowledge and managements specific account level experience. Key observations in 2010 from AIGs third party actuary that were factors in informing the base case reserve strengthening included: An analysis was performed on policy specific information including, for instance, policy limits, layers of coverage, ground up attachment points, and self insured retentions/deductibles. This policyholder specific data provided the third party actuary with an ability to refine its models to produce more account specific reserves and reduce the amount of standard model assumptions (i.e., industry assumptions). This new information allowed the third party actuary to consider certain policies for which assumed losses would not be allocated evenly across years (i.e., pro rata) as assumed under the standard model. Through the third party actuarys review of the policy data as provided by AIG, the third party actuary identified specific additional policies with no claim activity to date and included them in its modeling for certain accounts. These additional policies provided the actuary with the ability to replace its standard assumptions used in the pure IBNR calculation, with actual identified policies. During the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG and the third party actuary increased the estimate of reserves in recognition of general industry litigation trends attempting to expand asbestos coverage theories. With the assistance of the third party actuary, AIG periodically reviews its assumptions and modeling parameters used in its reserving estimates to calibrate the model to arrive at the most accurate estimate of AIGs experience. This regular calibration is a necessary step in ensuring that AIGs loss reserve estimate AIG 2011 Form 10 K 103 Table of Contents considers all relevant information and produces as accurate an estimate as possible. During its 2010 loss reserve review, the third party actuary recommended, and AIG agreed, that such changes be made to certain assumptions and model parameters. AIG completed a top down report year projection as well as a market share projection of its indicated asbestos and environmental loss reserves. These projections consist of a series of tests performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures. For asbestos, these tests project the losses expected to be reported over the next 16 years, i.e., from 2012 through 2027, based on the actual losses reported through 2011 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios were tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative. For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/severity tests are produced. Environmental claims from future report years (i.e., IBNR) are projected out five years, i.e., through the year 2016. At year end 2011, AIG considered a number of factors and recent experience in addition to the results of the respective top down and ground up analyses performed for asbestos and environmental reserves. AIG considered the significant uncertainty that remains as to AIGs ultimate liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims. This uncertainty is due to several factors including: the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies; the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies; diverging legal interpretations; and with respect to environmental claims, the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties. After AIG carefully considered the recent experience compared to the results of the 2010 ground up analysis as well as all of the above factors, no adjustment to gross and net asbestos reserves was recognized in 2011. Additionally in 2011, a moderate amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below and is primarily related to the reserves subject to the NICO reinsurance agreement. Upon completion of the environmental top down report year analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2011, a moderate adjustment to gross and net reserves was recognized. 104 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined: 2011 2010 2009 As of or for the Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos: Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year $ 5,526 $ 2,223 $ 3,236 $ 1,151 $ 3,443 $ 1,200 Dispositions (17 ) (8 ) (84 ) (21 ) Losses and loss expenses incurred 192 * 76 * 2,940 1,317 482 151 Losses and loss expenses paid (492 ) (236 ) (633 ) (237 ) (605 ) (179 ) Other changes 177 Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of year 5,226 2,240 5,526 2,223 3,236 1,151 Reduction of net loss reserves due to NICO transaction (1,703 ) Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of year, reflecting NICO transaction $ 5,226 $ 537 $ 5,526 $ 2,223 $ 3,236 $ 1,151 Environmental: Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year $ 240 $ 127 $ 338 $ 159 $ 417 $ 194 Dispositions (27 ) (10 ) (37 ) (7 ) Losses and loss expenses incurred 33 27 23 24 2 4 Losses and loss expenses paid (69 ) (35 ) (94 ) (46 ) (44 ) (32 ) Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of year $ 204 $ 119 $ 240 $ 127 $ 338 $ 159 Combined: Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year $ 5,766 $ 2,350 $ 3,574 $ 1,310 $ 3,860 $ 1,394 Dispositions (44 ) (18 ) (121 ) (28 ) Losses and loss expenses incurred 225 103 2,963 1,341 484 155 Losses and loss expenses paid (561 ) (271 ) (727 ) (283 ) (649 ) (211 ) Other changes 177 Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of year 5,430 2,359 5,766 2,350 3,574 1,310 Reduction of net loss reserves due to NICO transaction (1,703 ) Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of year, reflecting NICO transaction $ 5,430 $ 656 $ 5,766 $ 2,350 $ 3,574 $ 1,310 * Primarily represents accretion of discount.

Survival Ratios Asbestos and Environmental The following table presents AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The significant increase in the gross and net survival ratios at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 relates to the reserve increases recorded in 2010. In addition, AIGs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at December 31, 2010 by approximately 0.1 years and 0.3 years, respectively; and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at December 31, 2009 by approximately 0.9 years and 1.9 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIGs determination of its reserves are not survival ratios, but instead the ground up and top down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio. The following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three year average payment: 2011 2010 2009 Years Ended December 31, Gross Net* Gross Net Gross Net Survival ratios: Asbestos 9.1 10.3 8.6 9.2 4.7 3.7 Environmental 2.9 3.1 3.7 3.2 4.5 3.5 Combined 8.4 9.3 8.1 8.4 4.7 3.7 * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis of presentation in the reserve activity table above, which excludes the effects of the NICO cession.  SunAmerica Operations SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups including term life, universal life, A&H products, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct to consumer platforms. In managing SunAmerica, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization. Operating income (loss) is not a substitute for pre tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of Operating income (loss) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of SunAmerica. The reconciliations to pre tax income are provided in the tables that follow. 106 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents  SunAmerica Results The following table presents SunAmerica results: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Domestic Life Insurance: Revenue: Premiums $ 2,513 $ 2,520 $ 2,671 % (6 )% Policy fees 1,478 1,576 1,581 (6 ) Net investment income 3,925 4,313 3,819 (9 ) 13 Other income 3 NM NM Operating expenses: Policyholder benefits and claims incurred 4,510 4,277 4,161 5 3 Interest credited to policyholder account balances 851 843 866 1 (3 ) Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 534 784 716 (32 ) 9 Other acquisition and insurance expenses 954 991 1,032 (4 ) (4 ) Operating income 1,070 1,514 1,296 (29 ) 17 Net realized capital gains (losses) 363 (75 ) (712 ) NM 89 Benefit (amortization) of DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) (29 ) (45 ) 35 36 NM Pre tax income $ 1,404 $ 1,394 $ 619 1 % 125 % Domestic Retirement Services: Revenue: Policy fees $ 1,227 $ 1,134 $ 1,075 8 % 5 % Net investment income 5,957 6,455 5,734 (8 ) 13 Other income 206 NM NM Operating expenses: Policyholder benefits and claims incurred 104 (1 ) 227 NM NM Interest credited to policyholder account balances 3,595 3,637 3,838 (1 ) (5 ) Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 694 491 952 41 (48 ) Other acquisition and insurance expenses 806 928 780 (13 ) 19 Operating income 2,191 2,534 1,012 (14 ) 150 Net realized capital losses (357 ) (1,176 ) (2,802 ) 70 58 Benefit (amortization) of DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital losses (328 ) (40 ) 73 NM NM Goodwill impairment charges (81 ) NM NM Pre tax income (loss) $ 1,506 $ 1,318 $ (1,798 ) 14 % NM % Total SunAmerica: Revenue: Premiums $ 2,513 $ 2,520 $ 2,671 % (6 )% Policy fees 2,705 2,710 2,656 2 Net investment income 9,882 10,768 9,553 (8 ) 13 Other income 209 NM NM Operating expenses: Policyholder benefits and claims incurred 4,614 4,276 4,388 8 (3 ) Interest credited to policyholder account balances 4,446 4,480 4,704 (1 ) (5 ) Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 1,228 1,275 1,668 (4 ) (24 ) Other acquisition and insurance expenses 1,760 1,919 1,812 (8 ) 6 Operating income 3,261 4,048 2,308 (19 ) 75 Net realized capital gains (losses) 6 (1,251 ) (3,514 ) NM 64 Benefit (amortization) of DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) (357 ) (85 ) 108 (320 ) NM Goodwill impairment charges (81 ) NM NM Pre tax income (loss) $ 2,910 $ 2,712 $ (1,179 ) 7 % NM % AIG 2011 Form 10 K 107 Table of Contents 2011 and 2010 Comparison SunAmerica reported a decrease in operating income in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting lower net investment income, higher DAC amortization and higher policyholder benefit expense in SunAmericas variable annuity business due to equity market conditions, and an increase in incurred but not reported (IBNR) death claim reserves. Net investment income reflected a slight decline in base yields (12 basis points), as investment purchases in late 2010 and 2011 were made at yields lower than the weighted average yields of the existing base portfolio. The lower yields were partially offset by an increase in income from the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. The following decreases in investment enhancement items also contributed to lower net investment income in 2011 compared to 2010: $471 million decrease in valuation gains on ML II; $196 million lower call and tender income; $163 million of losses from equity method investments in two trusts created by AIG to hold leased commercial aircraft, in which SunAmerica has non voting preferred equity and debt interests. The losses reflect aircraft impairments recorded by the trusts in 2011 based on reviews of aircraft recoverability, which consider projected undiscounted future cash flows subject to assumptions based on current macroeconomic and industry trends and conditions; and $121 million decrease in private equity funds and hedge funds income. DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses related to weaker equity market conditions were $93 million in 2011, compared to an $87 million reduction to expenses due to more favorable equity market conditions in 2010. In a weak equity market, SunAmerica increases policyholder benefit reserves to recognize the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities. The DAC asset related to these products may also be adjusted through amortization expense, to reflect updates of future estimated gross profits due to equity market assumptions. The effect on the estimated gross profits of variable products of short term fluctuations in the equity markets are mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to mean methodology. Under this methodology, SunAmerica assumes a long term growth rate for the assets backing these liabilities, which factors in potential short term fluctuations in the financial markets, and if the long term growth rate assumption is deemed to be unreasonable in light of the current market conditions, the long term growth rate assumption is revised upward or downward to reflect the revised estimate. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. SunAmerica recorded an increase of approximately $202 million in the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims in 2011 in conjunction with the use of the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) to identify potential claims not yet filed with its life insurance companies. Although SunAmerica has enhanced its claims practices to include use of the SSDMF, it is possible that industry wide regulatory inquiries, audits and other regulatory activity could result in the payment of additional death claims, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties and interest. Offsetting these decreases in operating income was $226 million of legal settlement net proceeds received in 2011. In three separate agreements, SAFG Retirement Services, Inc. (SAFG), formerly known as AIG Retirement Services, Inc. agreed to resolve its claims in the matter titled AIG Retirement Services, Inc. v. Altus Finance S.A. et al. Other acquisition and insurance expenses declined $159 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to legal expense accruals and state guaranty fund assessments which were higher in 2010, as well as a reduction in the cost of letters of credit related to reinsurance. Pre tax income for SunAmerica reflected net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010 due principally to a $981 million decline in other than temporary impairments, a decline in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GIC) reserves, and declines in the allowance for mortgage loans. These 108 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents improvements were partially offset by a $465 million increase in fair value losses of embedded derivatives, net of economic hedges, relating to variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees, compared to 2010, driven by declines in long term interest rates. Due to statutory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure related to these variable annuity contract features is unhedged. SunAmerica periodically evaluates the estimates used to establish its liabilities for future policy benefits and DAC. These estimates may be adjusted based on actual experience and management judgment regarding assumptions which include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. These current best estimates are used to determine whether to adjust DAC and record additional liabilities when unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investment securities are recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income, at each balance sheet date, as if the securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. An actual sale of the underlying securities could trigger an actual loss recognition event that would result in the amortization of DAC and the recognition of higher reserves through policyholder benefit expense due to a deficiency in future earnings. Primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment in 2011, SunAmerica recorded additional future policy benefits and adjustments to DAC totaling $1.6 billion, net of tax, as of December 31, 2011, which were charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and included within the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments.  2010 and 2009 Comparison SunAmerica reported an increase in operating income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher net investment income and favorable changes in DAC and SIA amortization and policyholder benefit expenses due to improved equity market conditions in 2010 relative to 2009. Higher net investment income in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected the following: $699 million increase in private equity funds and hedge funds income; $539 million increase in valuation gains on ML II; and $279 million higher call and tender income. In 2009, DAC and SIA amortization unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $611 million were primarily due to reductions in the long term growth assumptions and deteriorated equity market conditions early in 2009 for group retirement products and individual variable annuities, and projected increases in surrenders for individual fixed annuities. The 2010 unlocking and reserve strengthening was not significant. The improvement in the pre tax results for SunAmerica in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected a decline in net realized capital losses due principally to a significant decline in other than temporary impairments, and an increase in net realized gains from the sale of investments in 2010 partially offset by affordable housing partnership impairments and an increase in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves.

Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing customers.  Premiums Premiums represent premiums received on traditional life insurance policies and deposits on life contingent payout annuities. Premiums, deposits and other considerations is a non GAAP measure which includes life insurance premiums, deposits on annuity contracts and mutual funds. The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums, deposits and other considerations to premiums: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Premiums, deposits and other considerations $ 23,838 $ 19,086 $ 18,807 Deposits (21,376 ) (16,462 ) (15,993 ) Other 51 (104 ) (143 ) Premiums $ 2,513 $ 2,520 $ 2,671 2011 and 2010 Comparison Total premiums, deposits and other considerations increased in 2011 as deposits from individual fixed annuities, individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds all showed significant increases. Group retirement deposits increased primarily due to higher levels of individual rollover deposits in 2011. Individual fixed annuity deposits increased as certain bank distributors negotiated a lower commission in exchange for a higher rate offered to policyholders which made SunAmericas individual fixed annuity products more attractive. However, fixed annuity deposits declined in the latter part of 2011 from the first six months of 2011 due to significant declines in interest rates. Variable annuity sales increased due to reinstatements of relationships at a number of key broker dealers, and increased wholesaler productivity. Deposits from life insurance products increased in 2011 but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels and a large private placement variable annuity sale in 2010. Retail mutual fund annual sales growth was driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.s Specialty Series product offerings (Alternative Strategies and Global Trends) and the Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio. SunAmerica grew new sales of mortality based life insurance products during 2011 by strengthening the core retail independent distribution channel and continuing to focus on career agent and direct to consumer distribution. Retail life sales increased 17 percent during 2011 as SunAmerica continues to re engage independent 110 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents distribution channels. Affiliated distribution channels grew 11 percent in 2011 as a result of an enhanced product suite that appeals to middle market consumers. Matrix Direct, SunAmericas direct to consumer platform, has proven highly effective for the distribution of term life and A&H products. The decline in institutional sales during 2011 reflects several large variable universal life sales during 2010. 2010 and 2009 Comparison Total premiums, deposits and other considerations increased in 2010 compared to 2009 as improved sales from life insurance, group retirement products and individual variable annuities offset a decline in individual fixed annuity deposits. Group Retirement deposits increased for 2010 primarily due to improved sales from individual rollovers. Individual fixed annuity deposits decreased primarily due to the low interest rate environment in 2010. Variable annuity sales increased due to competitive product enhancements, reinstatements at a number of key broker dealers, and increased wholesaler productivity. Payout annuity sales increased in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of improved structured settlement and immediate annuity sales. Life insurance sales decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by term and universal life products sold through independent and career distribution networks.

However, individual fixed annuities net flows declined in the second half of the year due to lower deposits resulting from the low interest rate environment. Should the current low interest rate environment persist, net flows are likely to decline in 2012 from 2011 levels. Surrender rates for individual fixed annuities also decreased in 2011 due to the low interest rate environment and the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. SunAmerica has returned to a more normal level of group surrender activity that no longer reflects the negative AIG publicity associated with the events of 2008 and 2009. Individual variable annuities net flows improved from 2010 levels due primarily to higher deposits throughout 2011 and turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2011. 112 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents 2010 and 2009 Comparison Surrender rates continued to improve in 2010 compared to 2009 for group retirement products, individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities as surrenders have returned to more normal levels. Surrender rates for individual fixed annuities have decreased significantly in 2010 due to the low interest rate environment and the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace.

Aircraft Leasing Operations AIGs Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFCs own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIGs chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, Aircraft Leasing is being presented as a standalone reportable segment. It was previously reported as a component of the Financial Services reportable segment. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the segment changes. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 113 Table of Contents  Aircraft Leasing Results Aircraft Leasing results were as follows: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Aircraft leasing revenues: Rental revenue $ 4,447 $ 4,727 $ 4,932 (6 )% (4 )% Interest and other revenues 20 22 35 (9 ) (37 ) Total aircraft leasing revenues 4,467 4,749 4,967 (6 ) (4 ) Interest expense 1,427 1,397 1,222 2 14 Loss on extinguishment of debt 61 NM NM Aircraft leasing expense: Depreciation expense 1,871 1,968 1,973 (5 ) Impairments charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges 1,689 1,704 51 (1 ) NM Other expenses 414 378 361 10 5 Total aircraft leasing expense 3,974 4,050 2,385 (2 ) 70 Operating income (loss) (995 ) (698 ) 1,360 (43 ) NM Net realized capital gains (losses) (10 ) (31 ) 25 68 NM Pre tax income (loss) $ (1,005 ) $ (729 ) $ 1,385 (38 )% NM % 2011 and 2010 Comparison The Aircraft Leasing pre tax loss increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower rental revenues as a result of a reduction in ILFCs average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and lower lease revenue earned on re leased aircraft in its fleet, partially offset by lower depreciation charges. In 2011, ILFC had an average of 932 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 963 in 2010. Additionally, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges of $1.7 billion in each of 2011 and 2010. The impairment charges in 2011 resulted from unfavorable trends affecting the residual values of certain aircraft types. In monitoring the aircraft in ILFCs fleet for impairment charges on an on going basis, ILFC considers facts and circumstances such as projected lease rates and terms, residual values, overhaul rental realization and aircraft holding periods. These items are considered in determining whether ILFC would need to modify its assumptions used in its recoverability assessments. In addition to these factors, ILFC considered its newly acquired end of life management capabilities from its acquisition of AeroTurbine and its impact on ILFCs strategy, as well as potential sales. While ILFCs overall business model has not changed, its expectation of how it may manage out of production aircraft, or aircraft that have been affected by new technology developments, changed due to the AeroTurbine acquisition. The result of the overall assessment based on ILFCs updated assumptions and managements change in its end of life strategy for older generation aircraft indicated that the book value of certain aircraft were not fully recoverable and these aircraft were deemed impaired. The aircraft impaired were primarily out of production aircraft, or aircraft that have been impacted by new technology developments.  2010 and 2009 Comparison ILFC reported a pre tax loss in 2010 compared to pre tax income in 2009 primarily due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related charges recorded on aircraft in its fleet. During 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses of $1.1 billion on certain aircraft in its fleet reflecting managements outlook related to new technology developments and the future recovery of the airline industry due to a decrease in demand for certain aircraft types, increased volatility in fuel costs and changes in other macroeconomic conditions which, when aggregated, resulted in lower future estimated lease rates used in ILFCs annual recurring recoverability assessment. Additionally, ILFC recorded asset impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease related 114 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents charges aggregating $597 million on aircraft sold. ILFC also incurred increased interest expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates, and an increase in the provision for overhauls to reflect an increase in future reimbursements.  Other Operations The components of AIGs Other operations were revised in the third quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the reclassification of non aircraft leasing operations from the Financial Services reportable segment as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as follows: AIGFPs derivatives portfolio, previously reported as a component of the Financial Services reportable segment is now reported with AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) as Global Capital Markets in Other Operations. AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. operations and Institutional Asset Management, previously reported as components of Direct Investment book and Asset Management operations within Other operations, respectively, are now reported in Corporate & Other. AIGs Other operations include the following: Mortgage Guaranty UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan to value conventional first lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one to four family residences. Global Capital Markets consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties. The active wind down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Although the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, the portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIGs risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio. Direct Investment book includes results for the MIP and the results of certain non derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. Retained Interests Fair value gains or losses on AIGs remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering, the retained interest in ML III, and, prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the MetLife securities that were received as consideration from the sale of ALICO. Corporate & Other consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation related charges and credits, and net gains and losses on sales of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment. Divested Businesses include operating results of certain businesses that have been divested that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations classification, primarily consisting of AIA in 2010.

Mortgage Guaranty The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically, and to a lesser extent, internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan to value conventional first lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one to four family residences. The following table presents pre tax income for Mortgage Guaranty: Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Underwriting results: Net premiums written $ 801 $ 756 $ 911 6 % (17 )% (Increase) decrease in unearned premiums (9 ) 219 119 NM 84 Net premiums earned 792 975 1,030 (19 ) (5 ) Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred 834 500 2,869 67 (83 ) Underwriting expenses 183 295 2 (38 ) NM Underwriting profit (loss) (225 ) 180 (1,841 ) NM NM Investing and other results: Net investment income 132 149 168 (11 ) (11 ) Net realized capital gains (losses) 20 44 (15 ) (55 ) NM Pre tax income (loss) $ (73 ) $ 373 $ (1,688 ) NM % NM % 116 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents 2011 and 2010 Comparison UGC recorded a pre tax loss in 2011 compared to pre tax income in 2010, primarily due to: an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $334 million, primarily in first lien business, reflecting increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims and unfavorable first lien loss development of $76 million in 2011, compared to favorable loss development of $385 million in 2010, partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first lien, second lien and international products, and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major European lender that resulted in a $43 million benefit; declines in earned premiums from the second lien, private student loan and international businesses, which were placed into runoff during 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first lien business; and the accrual of $22 million to pay for previously rescinded losses, certain legal fees and interest in connection with an adverse judgment. UGC has appealed the courts decision. Partially offsetting these declines was a reduction in underwriting expenses compared to 2010 reflecting a $94 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010. Remedy losses represent the indemnification for losses incurred by lenders arising from obligations contractually assumed by UGC as a result of underwriting services provided to lenders during times of high loan origination activity. UGC believes it has adequately accrued for these losses at December 31, 2011. Pre tax income for 2010 also includes gains of approximately $150 million from legal settlements and reinsurance commutations. 2010 and 2009 Comparison Mortgage Guaranty reported pre tax income in 2010 compared to a pre tax loss in 2009, driven by: favorable prior year reserve development, primarily in first liens, due to increased cures, rescissions and claims denials, compared to unfavorable development in 2009; gains of $150 million in 2010 from legal settlements and reinsurance commutations; and lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first lien, second lien and international products, partially offset by increased delinquencies in private student loans. During 2010, UGC commuted the majority of its private student loan portfolio. Partially offsetting the improved 2010 results were: lower earned premiums in first lien, second lien, and international businesses in 2010; the accrual of $94 million of remedy losses in 2010 as noted above; and the amortization of the second lien premium deficiency reserve of $222 million in 2009. Risk in Force The following table presents risk in force and delinquency ratio information for Mortgage Guaranty domestic business: At December 31, (dollars in billions) 2011 2010 Domestic first lien: Risk in force $ 25.6 $ 25.3 60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a) 13.9 % 16.3 % Domestic second lien: Risk in force(b) $ 1.5 $ 2.1 (a) Based on number of policies. (b) Represents the full amount of second lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second lien pools have reinstatement provisions, which will expire as the loan balances are repaid. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 117 Table of Contents  Global Capital Markets Operations 2011 and 2010 Comparison Global Capital Markets reported a pre tax loss in 2011 compared to pre tax income in 2010 primarily due to a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio and losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010 on the AIGFP CDS contracts referencing single name exposures written on corporate, index and asset backed credits, which are not included in the AIGFP super senior CDS portfolio. These items were partially offset by improvements related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustments of AIGFPs derivative assets and liabilities. During 2011, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior CDS portfolio of $339 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $598 million in 2010. The reduction in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi sector CDOs driven by price declines of the underlying assets. AIGFP also recognized a loss of $23 million in 2011 on CDS contracts referencing single name exposures as compared to a gain of $149 million in 2010 due to a decline in market conditions. During 2011, AIGFP recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on derivative assets and liabilities of $53 million compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $200 million in 2010 due to a narrowing of corporate spreads. 2010 and 2009 Comparison Global Capital Markets reported lower pre tax income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior CDS portfolio and the significant decrease related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustments of AIGFPs derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower costs related to the continued wind down of AIGFPs businesses and portfolios. During 2010, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior CDS portfolio of $598 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.4 billion in 2009. During 2010, AIGFP recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on derivative assets and liabilities of $200 million compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $775 million in 2009. See Critical Accounting Estimates Level 3 Assets and Liabilities herein for a discussion of AIGFPs super senior CDS portfolio.  Direct Investment Book Results 2011 and 2010 Comparison The Direct Investment book pre tax income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non derivative assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and lower interest income in the MIP due to approximately $4.9 billion in sales of investments during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 to increase liquidity. These declines were partially offset by significantly lower other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities. 2010 and 2009 Comparison The Direct Investment book pre tax income decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non derivative assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option, partially offset by significantly lower other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities. 118 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment book (excluding intercompany transactions): (in millions) Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets AIGs Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities Year Ended December 31, 2011 Bond trading securities $ (71 ) Notes and bonds payable $ 141 Loans and other assets 31 Hybrid financial instrument liabilities 147 Guaranteed Investment Agreements (GIAs) 112 Other liabilities 20 Decrease in assets $ (40 ) Decrease in liabilities $ 420 Net pre tax increase to Other income $ 380 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Bond trading securities $ 1,678 Notes and bonds payable $ (251 ) Loans and other assets 40 Hybrid financial instrument liabilities (311 ) GIAs (173 ) Other liabilities (44 ) Increase in assets $ 1,718 Increase in liabilities $ (779 ) Net pre tax increase to Other income $ 939 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Bond trading securities 2,095 Notes and bonds payable (163 ) Loans and other assets (48 ) Hybrid financial instrument liabilities (83 ) GIAs 172 Other liabilities (12 ) Increase in assets $ 2,047 Increase in liabilities $ (86 ) Net pre tax increase to Other income $ 1,961 Change in Fair Value of the MetLife Securities Prior to Sale AIG recognized a loss in 2011, representing the decline in the securities value, due to market conditions, from December 31, 2010 through the date of their sale in the first quarter of 2011.  Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities AIG recognized a $1.3 billion gain in 2011, a 12 percent increase in the value of AIGs 33 percent interest in AIA, which is recorded in Other invested assets and accounted for under the fair value method. In 2010, AIG recognized a $638 million loss on its interest in AIA during the approximate two month holding period following the initial public offering in late October 2010.  Change in Fair Value of ML III The loss attributable to AIGs interest in ML III for 2011 was due to significant spread widening and reduced interest rates. The gain of $1.8 billion on ML III for 2010 was attributable to the shortening of weighted average life by 1.34 years. Additionally, fair value for 2010 was positively affected by a decrease in projected credit losses in the underlying collateral securities. During 2010, credit spreads tightened by 287 basis points. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 119  Table of Contents  Corporate & Other Corporate & Other reported pre tax losses of $5.7 billion in 2011 compared to pre tax gains of $9.6 billion in 2010 primarily due to gains on sales of divested businesses in 2010, primarily related to AIA, partially offset by: a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; a reduction in other corporate expenses due to the securities litigation charges recorded in 2010; and a pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million resulting from the exchange of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer. These improvements were mostly offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the Recapitalization, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility and net realized capital losses recorded in 2011 compared to net realized capital gains in 2010. Corporate & Other reported pre tax income in 2010 compared to a pre tax loss in 2009 primarily due to the following: a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility; and gains on sales of divested businesses in 2010, primarily related to AIA, compared to losses in 2009.  Divested Businesses Divested businesses include the operating results of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting through the date of their sale. The Divested businesses results for 2010 primarily represent the historical results of AIA, which was deconsolidated in November 2010 in conjunction with its initial public offering.  CONSOLIDATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The following table presents AIGs consolidated other comprehensive income (loss): Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Change in unrealized appreciation of investments $ 5,518 $ 9,910 $ 33,221 $ (4,392 ) $ (23,311 ) Change in deferred acquisition costs adjustment and other (819 ) (946 ) (3,890 ) 127 2,944 Change in future policy benefits (2,302 ) (2,302 ) Change in foreign currency translation adjustments 8 703 2,933 (695 ) (2,230 ) Change in net derivative gains (losses) arising from cash flow hedging activities 51 105 95 (54 ) 10 Change in retirement plan liabilities adjustment (365 ) 9 168 (374 ) (159 ) Change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations (5,098 ) (5,082 ) 809 (16 ) (5,891 ) Deferred tax asset (liability) 177 (2,242 ) (11,579 ) 2,419 9,337 Total other comprehensive income (loss) $ (2,830 ) $ 2,457 $ 21,757 $ (5,287 ) $ (19,300 ) Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments The $5.5 billion increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to continued appreciation in bonds available for sale of $0.7 billion and $4.6 billion recognized by Chartis and SunAmerica, respectively, due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and declines in U.S. Treasury rates, which were partially offset by widening spreads. The $9.9 billion increase in 2010 primarily reflects the $0.6 billion and $7.0 billion appreciation in bonds available for sale held by Chartis and SunAmerica operations, respectively, due to lower U.S. Treasury rates and 120 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents slightly narrowed spreads. The structured securities portfolio accounted for more than half of the positive change in 2010, as RMBS and CMBS continued to recover from the distressed pricing levels of the financial crisis. The increase in 2010 also includes $578 million of appreciation in available for sale equities held by Chartis. The $33.2 billion in unrealized appreciation for 2009 reflects $30.2 billion and $2.9 billion in appreciation in bonds and equities available for sale, respectively, related to the continued recovery of the global financial markets in 2009, as investors returned to equity and bond markets.  Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other The decline in deferred acquisition costs in all periods is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest sensitive products. The decline since 2009 reflects the divestiture of multiple life insurance operations, including the sales of Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011, the deconsolidation of AIA in 2010 and sale of ALICO in 2010.  Change in Future Policy Benefits AIG periodically evaluates the assumptions used to establish its deferred acquisition costs and future policy benefits. These assumptions may be adjusted based on actual experience and management judgment. Key assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. Primarily as a result of the significant decline in interest rates during the latter half of 2011 and updated assumptions for mortality experience, AIG recorded additional future policy benefits through other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assumes the securities underlying certain traditional long duration products had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields.  Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Increases in foreign currency translation adjustments for all periods primarily reflect the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies. The decline in foreign currency translation adjustments over the three year period reflects the divestiture of multiple foreign operations, including the sales of Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011, the deconsolidation of AIA in 2010 and the sale of ALICO in 2010.  Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities The decline in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the gradual wind down of the cash flow hedge portfolio in 2011, 2010 and 2009, partially offset by a decline in the interest rate environment.  Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to the announced redesign and resulting remeasurement of the AIG Retirement and AIG Excess Plans, which will be converted to cash balance plans effective April 1, 2012. AIG recognized a $590 million pre tax reduction to Accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with the remeasurement at September 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate since December 31, 2010. This decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive income was partially offset by the effect of the increase in the discount rate in the fourth quarter in connection with the year end remeasurement. In 2010 and 2009, the effect of declining discount rates on pension benefit obligations was offset by the appreciation of investments held by the respective plans. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Divestitures and Deconsolidations The change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations in every period reflects the derecognition of all items in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the point of sale/deconsolidation for all entities, AIG 2011 Form 10 K 121 Table of Contents including domestic entities. In 2011, the most significant entities were AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan. In 2010, the most significant entities were AIA and ALICO. In 2009, the most significant entities were Transatlantic, 21st Century and HSB.  Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pre tax Other Comprehensive Loss was 5.9 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the effects of the Nan Shan disposition. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on pre tax Other Comprehensive Income was 47.7 percent, primarily due to the effects of the AIA initial public offering, the ALICO disposition and changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries, including AIG Star and AIG Edison. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate on pre tax Other Comprehensive Income was 34.7 percent, which did not materially differ from the statutory 35 percent rate.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  OVERVIEW AIG Parents primary sources of liquidity are short term investments and borrowing availability under syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities. Subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries. Highlights of 2011 actions affecting capital resources and liquidity include: the Recapitalization in January 2011 (more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); approximately $3.0 billion paid to AIG Parent from Chartis and SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from their subsidiaries; $2.9 billion issuance of AIG Common Stock; $2.0 billion senior unsecured note issuance; additional $500 million contingent liquidity facility arranged; $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization in November 2011, with repurchases of approximately $70 million at year end; exchange of $2.4 billion of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for $1.8 billion of new senior unsecured notes; membership of certain SunAmerica insurance companies in the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which provides these companies access to collateralized borrowing opportunities to enhance their liquidity; repayment of total debt of $18.5 billion, excluding the Recapitalization in January 2011; and $3.8 billion net capital contributions to Chartis, partially funded from the retention of $2 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison and available cash at AIG Parent (more fully described in Uses of Liquidity below).  Liquidity Adequacy Management AIG maintains a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess AIGs aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIGs existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress 122 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents testing methodology for both insurance and non insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks. AIGs insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERMs stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation in order to determine the liquidity required of AIG Parent to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non insurance operations, including the Global Capital Markets derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment book and ILFC. AIGs consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parents liquidity requirements under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parents overall liquidity sources over the specified two year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then prevailing market conditions. As a result of these ERM stress tests and other considerations discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. AIG has in place unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SunAmerica insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to continue to enhance AIGs capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. AIG expects to enter into additional CMAs with certain other Chartis insurance companies as needed in 2012. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries SunAmerica below.  Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents selected data from AIGs Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Summary: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 35 $ 16,910 $ 18,584 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 36,332 (10,225 ) 5,778 Net cash used in financing activities (36,926 ) (9,261 ) (28,997 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 29 39 533 Decrease in cash (530 ) (2,537 ) (4,102 ) Cash at beginning of year 1,558 4,400 8,642 Change in cash of businesses held for sale 446 (305 ) (140 ) Cash at end of year $ 1,474 $ 1,558 $ 4,400 Operating Cash Flow Activities The decline in Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was principally due to the following: the payment in cash of the FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest and fees by AIG Parent totaling $6.4 billion, which were previously paid in kind, and accordingly did not reduce operating cash flows in prior periods; AIG 2011 Form 10 K 123 Table of Contents a $10.4 billion reduction in cash provided by operating activities attributable to foreign life subsidiaries that were sold (i.e., AIA, ALICO, AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan), which subsidiaries generated operational cash inflows of $3.4 billion, $13.8 billion and $7.4 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; and the effect of catastrophes and the cession of the bulk of Chartis net asbestos liabilities in the United States to NICO. Excluding the impact of the NICO cession and catastrophes, cash provided by AIGs reportable segments in 2011 is consistent with 2010, as increases in claims paid were offset by increases in premiums collected at the insurance subsidiaries. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Cash provided by Chartis operations was $1.9 billion for 2010 compared to $2.8 billion in 2009 as a reduction in claims paid was more than offset by declines in premiums collected, arising primarily from a decrease in U.S. and Canada region production. Catastrophic events and significant casualty losses, the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable, reduce operating cash flow for Chartis operations. Cash provided by AIGs life insurance subsidiaries, including entities presented as discontinued operations, was $15.5 billion for 2010 compared to $9.1 billion in 2009 as growth in international markets was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from U.S. and Canada region operations.  Investing Cash Flow Activities Net cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to: the utilization of $26.4 billion of restricted cash generated from the AIA IPO and ALICO sale in connection with the Recapitalization and $9.6 billion disposition of MetLife securities, described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan in 2011 for total proceeds of $6.4 billion; and net sales of short term investments and maturities of available for sale investments, primarily at Chartis and SunAmerica, which were partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments. Net cash used in investing activities in 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities, resulting from AIGs investment of cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in 2009. In 2009, Net cash provided by investing activities reflected from the net proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.  Financing Cash Flow Activities Net cash used in financing activities was significantly higher in 2011 primarily due to the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $12.4 billion partial repayment of the SPV Preferred Interests in connection with the Recapitalization described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and use of proceeds received from the sales of foreign life insurance entities in 2011. Net cash used in financing activities was significantly lower in 2010 than in 2009, primarily as a result of declines in policyholder contract withdrawals, reflecting improved conditions for the life insurance and retirement services businesses was partially offset by the issuance of long term debt by ILFC, which is discussed in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Aircraft Leasing below.  Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries  AIG Parent The Recapitalization in January 2011 involved a series of integrated transactions which had a direct effect on AIGs liquidity activities and financial position. These transactions included the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the partial repayment of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests. These transactions 124 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are excluded from the Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Liquidity discussions below. In addition, in 2011, several significant asset sales were completed, including the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in February 2011, the sale of the MetLife securities in March 2011, and the sale of Nan Shan in August 2011. Proceeds from these sales primarily were used to pay down the Department of the Treasurys SPV Preferred Interests. These transactions are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are excluded from the Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Liquidity discussion below. In May 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. A portion of the net proceeds AIG received from the offering, $550 million has been used to fund a litigation settlement, and AIG used the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. AIG issues debt securities in the public, private and non U.S. markets from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries. AIG engages in secured and unsecured borrowings to support its capital structure, corporate needs and the operations of subsidiaries. Liquidity sources of AIG and its respective subsidiaries are utilized to fund repayment of these obligations, including any additional funding requirements where cash flows from assets supporting borrowing obligations are not sufficient. On September 13, 2011, AIG raised approximately $2.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $1.2 billion in three year notes and $800 million in five year notes. AIG is using the proceeds from the sale of these notes to pay maturing notes that were issued by AIG to fund the MIP. On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364 Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3 Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated and AIG entered into a $1.5 billion 364 Day Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4 Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4 Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. The $1.3 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Chartis letter of credit facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the 4 Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on these facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. In October 2011, AIG entered into a contingent liquidity facility under which AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIGs discretion. In November 2011, AIG exchanged specified series of its outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures for newly issued senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer. In particular, AIG exchanged (i) $312 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A 1 Junior Subordinated Debentures for $256 million aggregate principal amount of its new 6.820 percent Dollar notes due November 15, 2037, (ii) &pound;812 million ($1.3 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A 2 and Series A 8 Junior Subordinated Debentures for &pound;662 million ($1.0 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its new 6.765 percent Sterling notes due November 15, 2017 and (iii) &euro;591 million ($766 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A 3 Junior Subordinated Debentures for &euro;421 million ($545 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its new 6.797 percent Euro notes due November 15, 2017. The exchange resulted in a pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million, which is reflected in Net loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and a deferred gain of $65 million, which will be amortized as a decrease in interest expense, and is reflected in Other long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 125 Table of Contents AIG has established and maintains substantial actual and contingent liquidity. The following table presents AIG Parents liquidity: (In millions) As of December 31, 2011 Cash(a) $ 176 Short term investments(b) 9,627 Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities(c) 3,200 Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facilities(d) 1,000 Total AIG Parent liquidity sources $ 14,003 (a) Excludes Cash and Short term Investments held by AIGFP which are considered to be unrestricted and available for use by AIG Parent of $64 million at December 31, 2011. (b)Includes reverse repurchase agreements totaling $6.6 billion used to reduce unsecured exposures. (c)For additional information relating to the syndicated bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below. (d)For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facilities, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.  Sources of Liquidity AIGs primary sources of cash flow are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. In 2011, AIG Parent: collected $3.3 billion in payments from subsidiaries, including $1.5 billion in dividends from Chartis and $1.4 billion in note repayments from SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from subsidiaries; raised approximately $2.9 billion in net proceeds from the sale of AIG Common Stock; raised approximately $2.0 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes; and arranged a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. These items are discussed under Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries AIG Parent above. In addition, on September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S 1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed. All proceeds received by AIG will be used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasurys AIA SPV Preferred Interests.  Uses of Liquidity AIG Parents primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In 2011, AIG Parent retired $6.2 billion of debt, including $3.2 billion of MIP obligations, and made interest payments totaling $2.2 billion. Approximately $4.4 billion of AIG Parents cash and short term investments balance is attributable to the MIP and is available to meet obligations of the DIB. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Other Operations Direct Investment Book below for additional details. AIG Parent made $2.9 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in 2011 (which amount reflects the $3.7 billion contributed to Chartis in response to the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010). This transaction was funded from the retention of $2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison (for which the Department of the Treasury provided a waiver permitting AIG to use such proceeds for this purpose instead of using the proceeds to pay down the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests) and available cash at AIG Parent. 126 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. No assurance can be given, however, that AIGs cash needs will not exceed its projected liquidity. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIGs credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIGs ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.  Chartis AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments, totaling $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient. In the first quarter of 2011, Chartis received a capital contribution of $3.7 billion in cash from AIG Parent following the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. Chartis used $1.8 billion of this amount to purchase certain assets from the DIB. Chartis subsequently returned capital of $2.2 billion to AIG Parent in the form of all of the outstanding stock of UGC in the first quarter of 2011. In 2011, Chartis paid dividends of $1.5 billion to AIG Parent. One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIGs credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries, which could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiarys ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies projected total authorized control level Risk Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines and determined based on the companies statutory financial statements). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, subject to board and regulatory approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage. In February 2012, AIG and these Chartis insurance companies entered into a new, single CMA, which replaces the CMAs entered into in February 2011. Under the new CMA, the total adjusted capital and total authorized control level RBC of these Chartis insurance companies will be measured as a group (the Fleet) rather than on an individual company basis. As a result, the new CMA provides that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of the Fleet at or above a specified minimum percentage of the Fleets projected total authorized control level RBC (as determined based on the companies statutory financial statements). In addition, the new CMA provides that if the total adjusted capital of the Fleet is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of the Fleets total authorized control level RBC, subject to board approval and regulatory requirements (including the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law), these Chartis insurance companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage of the Fleets projected total authorized control level RBC. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 127 Table of Contents Chartis continues to identify cost effective opportunities to allocate its capital through the use of intercompany reinsurance. During September 2011, a $725 million letter of credit facility was put in place, under which Chartis and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) acted as co obligors. ACNL, a Chartis subsidiary and member of the Lloyds of London insurance syndicate (Lloyds), is required to hold capital at Lloyds, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2012 and 2013 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $583 million as of December 31, 2011 was satisfied with a letter of credit.  SunAmerica Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments, totaling $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2011. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their investment maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed maturity securities in order to reduce the levels of cash, cash equivalents and other short term instruments that had been maintained during 2009 and 2010. In 2011, the SunAmerica life insurance companies paid dividends and surplus note interest totaling approximately $2.0 billion to their respective holding companies, of which $1.4 billion was used to provide liquidity to AIG Parent through the repayment of intercompany loans. In addition, $125 million from litigation settlement proceeds received by SunAmerica in 2011 was used to provide liquidity to AIG Parent. The most significant potential liquidity requirements of the SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmericas investment portfolios, AIG believes that normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk. As part of its risk management framework, SunAmerica is evaluating and will implement programs to enhance its liquidity position and facilitate SunAmericas ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio, including securities lending programs structured to increase liquidity. During 2012, SunAmerica began utilizing securities lending programs, primarily as an additional source of liquidity. In addition, in 2011, certain SunAmerica insurance companies became members of the FHLBs in their respective districts, primarily as an additional source of liquidity. This membership allows them to pledge certain mortgage backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets to secure advances obtained from the FHLBs. As of December 31, 2011, SunAmerica had no outstanding borrowings from any of the FHLBs. In January 2012, however, SunAmerica borrowed $36 million from the FHLBs to confirm its ability to access this source of liquidity. Upon any potential event of default by SunAmerica, the FHLBs recovery would be limited to the amount of SunAmericas liability under advances borrowed. In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies projected company action level RBCs. In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs, subject to board and regulatory approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. 128 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents  Aircraft Leasing ILFCs sources of liquidity include existing cash and short term investments of $2.0 billion, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances, and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. In 2011, ILFC improved its liquidity position by entering into an unsecured $2.0 billion three year revolving credit facility and a secured $1.5 billion term loan facility. In addition, on May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with $1.0 billion maturing in 2016 and $1.25 billion maturing in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of 2011. On December 22, 2011, ILFC issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2022. On February 6, 2012, ILFC announced that it intends to raise a new senior secured term loan of $900 million, with the proceeds to be used to repay a portion of its outstanding debt and related interest expense and for general corporate purposes. The senior secured term loan will be secured primarily by a first priority perfected lien on the equity of certain ILFC subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own a pool of aircraft and related leases. See Debt herein and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on ILFCs revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt.  Other Operations  Mortgage Guaranty AIG currently expects that its UGC subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. UGC subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments, totaling $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011. Further, UGC businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds ($3.0 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2011), which UGC could monetize in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  Global Capital Markets AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties and executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. The active wind down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Although the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, the portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIGs risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. AIGFP continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity requirements in connection with its remaining derivatives portfolio. Cash collateral posted by AIG Markets to third parties was $174 million and $2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash collateral obtained by AIG Markets from third parties was $372 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 129 Table of Contents The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP: (in millions) Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2010 Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty Collateral Returned by Counterparties Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2011 Super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio $ 3,786 $ 594 $ 1,183 $ 3,197 All other derivatives 1,335 1,511 1,128 1,718 Total $ 5,121 $ 2,105 $ 2,311 $ 4,915 The collateral amounts presented in the table above are reflective of counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and is inclusive of collateral that exceeds the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date. Collateral obtained by AIGFP from third parties was $791 million and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table presents the net notional amount and number of outstanding trade positions in AIGFPs portfolios: Percentage Decrease (dollars in billions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Net notional amount(a) $ 176 $ 341 $ 900 (48 )% (62 )% Super senior CDS contracts (included in net notional amount above) 25 60 184 (58 ) (67 ) Outstanding trade positions(b) 2,000 3,900 16,100 (49 ) (76 ) (a) Excludes $10.2 billion, $11.5 billion and $40.7 billion of intercompany derivatives in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (b) Excludes approximately 4,800 non derivative trade positions that were transferred to Direct Investment book in 2010.  Direct Investment Book As of December 31, 2011, management expects the DIBs investments to provide sufficient return to fund the DIB maturing liabilities. The DIBs investment portfolio consists primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans, mortgage loans and equity securities. While a significant portion of the DIBs liquidity requirements are supported by existing liquidity sources or maturing investments, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy liquidity requirements. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets if required, proceeds from asset sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount required. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is maintained by the DIB to meet near term liquidity requirements. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. During 2011, $1.8 billion of assets held by the DIB were sold to certain Chartis subsidiaries. In addition, during 2011, AIG assigned approximately 52 percent of AIGs interest in ML III to the DIB, subject to liens on those interests as set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement dated December 8, 2010, among AIG Parent, AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC), AIA Aurora LLC, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, and the Trust. In the third quarter of 2011, AIG issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, $1.2 billion of 4.250% Notes Due 2014 and $800 million of 4.875% Notes Due 2016. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are being used to pay maturing MIP debt and the notes are included within "MIP notes payable" in the debt outstanding table below. 130 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents  Debt  Debt Maturities The following table summarizes maturing debt at December 31, 2011 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters: (in millions) First Quarter 2012 Second Quarter 2012 Third Quarter 2012 Fourth Quarter 2012 Total ILFC $ 1,032 $ 620 $ 780 $ 591 $ 3,023 Borrowings supported by assets (DIB) 1,347 2,007 234 169 3,757 General borrowings 27 156 183 Other 1 1 1 3 Total $ 2,407 $ 2,628 $ 1,015 $ 916 $ 6,966 AIGs plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows: ILFCs sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash and short term investments of $2.0 billion, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Aircraft Leasing. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, ILFC had $2.0 billion available under its unsecured three year revolving credit facility. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance its existing debt or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations. AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt included in the DIB. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. At December 31, 2011, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through December 31, 2012 are supported by short term investments and maturing investments.

Currently, AIG and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities, including a facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes and for letter of credit issuance. AIG intends to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. All facilities, except for ILFCs five year and four year AeroTurbine syndicated credit facilities maturing October 2012 and December 2015, respectively, are unsecured. At December 31, 2011 (in millions) Facility Size Borrower(s) Available Amount Expiration One Year Term Out Option Effective Date AIG: 364 Day Syndicated Facility $ 1,500 AIG $ 1,500 October 2012 Yes 10/12/2011 4 Year Syndicated Facility 3,000 AIG 1,700 October 2015 No 10/12/2011 Total AIG $ 4,500 $ 3,200 ILFC: 5 Year Syndicated Facility $ 457 ILFC $ October 2012 No 10/13/2006 4 Year AeroTurbine Syndicated Facility 335 ILFC 66 December 2015 No 12/9/2011 3 Year Syndicated Facility 2,000 ILFC 2,000 January 2014 No 1/31/2011 Total ILFC $ 2,792 $ 2,066 On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364 Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3 Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated and AIG entered into a $1.5 billion 364 Day Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4 Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4 Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. The $1.3 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Chartis letter of credit facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the 4 Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on these facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. AIGs ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings. AIGs ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIGs maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth, total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization and total priority debt (defined as debt of AIGs subsidiaries and secured debt of AIG) to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIGs access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIGs financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. ILFCs three year credit facility which became effective January 31, 2011 contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that, among other things, restrict ILFC from entering into secured financing in excess of 30 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in the agreement, less $2.0 billion, excluding fixed asset financings. As of February 21, 2012, ILFC would be able to incur an additional $3.0 billion of secured indebtedness under this covenant. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. ILFC subsequently amended and extended the facility and the $457 million outstanding under the facility currently matures in October 2012. This facility is secured by the equity interest in certain of ILFCs non restricted subsidiaries, which hold a pool of aircraft with an appraised value of not less than 133 percent of the principal amount of the outstanding loans. The amended facility prohibits ILFC from re borrowing amounts repaid under this facility for any reason; therefore, the size of the outstanding revolving credit facility is $457 million. ILFC is also a guarantor for a $335 million four year credit facility entered AIG 2011 Form 10 K 133 Table of Contents into by AeroTurbine, a wholly owned subsidiary of ILFC, whose assets are pledged as security for the outstanding amount. In February 2012, ILFC increased AeroTurbines facility by $95 million to $430 million.  Contingent Liquidity Facilities AIG has access to contingent liquidity facilities of up to $1 billion as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes: In 2010, AIG established a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the counterparty. In October 2011, AIG entered into a contingent liquidity facility under which AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIGs discretion. AIGs ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings.  Credit Ratings The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short and long term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of February 15, 2012. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that ratings relative rank within the agencys rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(b)S&P ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc. These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG managements request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. 134 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents Adverse ratings actions regarding our long term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require AIGFP to post additional collateral payments pursuant to, and or permit the termination of, derivative transactions to which AIGFP is a party, which could adversely affect AIGs business, its consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or its liquidity. Credit ratings estimate a companys ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to that company of financing. In the event of a further downgrade of AIGs long term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFPs counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. See Notes 12 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on AIGs derivative transactions and GIA collateral arrangements.  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity: Payments due by Period December 31, 2011 (in millions) Total Payments 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Loss reserves $ 94,328 $ 20,941 $ 26,035 $ 14,564 $ 32,788 Insurance and investment contract liabilities 232,531 13,770 29,954 25,965 162,842 Aircraft purchase commitments 19,036 1,866 3,190 5,593 8,387 Borrowings 73,400 6,966 12,890 12,065 41,479 Interest payments on borrowings 46,442 4,233 7,877 6,717 27,615 Operating leases 1,748 422 566 332 428 Other long term obligations(a) 169 43 24 3 99 Total(b) $ 467,654 $ 48,241 $ 80,536 $ 65,239 $ 273,638 (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.3 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIGFPs credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At December 31, 2011, the fair value derivative liability was $3.1 billion, relating to AIGFPs super senior multi sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at December 31, 2011 AIGFP had posted collateral of $2.7 billion with respect to these swaps.  Loss Reserves Loss reserves relate to the Chartis and the Mortgage Guaranty business, and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by the individual Chartis and UGC subsidiaries to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments. Further, these businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which Chartis and UGC could seek to monetize in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash and Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries for matters that could affect operating cash flows and liquidity of these subsidiaries. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 135 Table of Contents  Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to SunAmerica businesses and include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of AIGs control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by individual SunAmerica subsidiaries to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments. In addition, SunAmerica businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which SunAmerica could seek to monetize in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. Liquidity needs for GIC liabilities are generally expected to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash and Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries herein for matters that could affect operating cash flows and liquidity of the subsidiaries.  Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2011, ILFC had committed to purchase 232 new aircraft and 26 additional aircraft, mostly through sale leaseback transactions with airlines, deliverable from 2012 through 2019, with aggregate estimated total remaining payments of approximately $19.0 billion, of which $1.9 billion are coming due in 2012. ILFC also has the right to purchase an additional 50 Airbus aircraft. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Aircraft Leasing herein.  Borrowings AIGs borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. The repayment of long term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG and its subsidiaries is expected to be made through maturing investments and asset sales, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements, as more fully described in Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries herein. 136 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity: Amount of Commitment Expiring Total Amounts Committed December 31, 2011 (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Guarantees: Liquidity facilities(a) $ 643 $ 542 $ $ $ 101 Standby letters of credit 438 419 15 3 1 Guarantees of indebtedness 170 170 All other guarantees(b) 516 84 102 157 173 Commitments: Investment commitments(c) 2,819 2,462 220 137 Commitments to extend credit 194 161 32 1 Letters of credit 26 25 1 Other commercial commitments(d) 827 33 3 791 Total(e) $ 5,633 $ 3,726 $ 373 $ 297 $ 1,237 (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)Includes commitments to invest in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (d)Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The annual pension contribution for 2012 is expected to be approximately $91 million for U.S. and non U.S. plans. (e)Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  Securities Financing The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIGs involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIGs involvement with VIEs, see Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Indemnification Agreements AIG is subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the sales of businesses completed pursuant to its asset disposition plan. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by AIG. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases no such limitation is specified or applicable. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 137 Table of Contents Where estimable, AIG has recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. AIG is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under certain of these arrangements. Overall, AIG believes that it is unlikely it will have to make any material payments related to completed sales under these arrangements. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding indemnification provisions for the ALICO, AGF, AIG Star and AIG Edison sales.  DIVIDENDS FROM INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIGs domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders that, in any 12 month period, exceed the lesser of ten percent of such companys statutory policyholders surplus or 100 percent of its "adjusted net investment income," as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIGs insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of AIGs foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of these restrictions, approximately 86 percent of the aggregate equity of AIGs consolidated insurance operations was restricted from transfer to AIG Parent at December 31, 2011. AIG cannot predict how regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar "watch list" with regard to solvency.  REGULATION AND SUPERVISION AIGs insurance subsidiaries, like other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. AIG Parent is not generally subject to supervision by state regulators, but certain transactions, such as those involving statutorily designated transactions with its insurance company subsidiaries and any transaction involving a change in control of AIG or any of its insurance company subsidiaries, may require the prior approval of state regulators. In the United States, the NAIC has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) Model Law requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. AIGs insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The principal differences between statutory financial statements for domestic companies and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are that in statutory financial statements acquisition costs are expensed instead of being deferred, a large portion of the bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, securities are valued on a different basis, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting practices and are charged directly to surplus. Further, statutory accounting practices do not give recognition to purchase accounting adjustments and require certain other reserves not required by U.S. GAAP. As discussed under Note 16(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices. In addition, insurance regulators routinely conduct examinations of AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations and examinations, or any additional regulation arising therefrom, might have on its business. Federal, state or local legislation, including Dodd Frank, may affect AIGs ability to operate its various financial services businesses, and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. 138 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents AIGs U.S. operations are subject to guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state that has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits recognized in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were $7 million, $16 million and $18 million. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business and, internationally, personal automobile business) that provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. A substantial portion of Chartis business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. Foreign insurance operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization, with which AIG complies in each country. In addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIGs financial condition or results of operations. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  INVESTMENTS  INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AIGs investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment book, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration. Domestically, fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of Chartis, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives. Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Chartis companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 139  Table of Contents The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities. AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIGs Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIGs liabilities. At December 31, 2011, approximately 88 percent of the fixed maturity securities were held by domestic entities. Approximately 21 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 13 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIGs investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third party rating services ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moodys, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIGs Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolios non rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2011, approximately 26 percent of the foreign fixed maturity investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 3 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 51 percent of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS During 2011, significant volatility in the capital markets resulted in challenging conditions, both domestically and globally. Ten year U.S. Treasuries dropped to historic lows as rates were down 142 basis points, settling at 1.88 percent at the end of the year. Rates were mixed as Germany, France, and other perceived strong economies followed the downward direction of U.S. rates, while countries such as Greece, Spain, and Italy saw a significant increase in their borrowing costs due to rising concerns over their fiscal situations. Equity markets started the year strongly, and were positive in the first half of the year before turning negative in the second half as the European sovereign debt crisis intensified, catastrophe losses approached record levels, unemployment remained at elevated levels, and a continued political standoff over measures addressing the U.S. deficit led to the first ever downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Domestic equity markets were flat for the year, outperforming their foreign counterparts. The performance in equity markets for 2011 stood in contrast to 2010, during which most markets recorded positive returns. The swing from positive to negative equity market performance, combined with capital markets volatility and a historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., resulted in lower net investment income in 2011 compared to 2010. An overview of investment activities during 2011 is provided below:  Asset Composition Insurance operations purchased approximately $92 billion of fixed maturity securities. The purchases were made using proceeds from sales and maturity of securities, paydowns on structured securities, cash flow from operations and investments, and from the redeployment of existing cash and short term investments. Short term investments were redeployed into approximately $23 billion of higher yielding fixed maturity securities during 2011. Corporate debt (primarily high grade) represented approximately half of new purchases. Risk weighted opportunistic investments in structured securities continued to be made to improve yields and increase net 140 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents investment income. The amount of such purchases totaled approximately $11 billion. The 2011 purchases of structured securities largely replaced similar assets sold on behalf of SunAmerica in 2010. In the case of Chartis, these purchases of structured securities were part of a deliberate diversification of the asset portfolio of the domestic property and casualty companies. Base yields at Chartis were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due to redeployment activities and the increase due to investments in structured securities. SunAmerica base yields were lower as new money rates were generally lower than on maturing or called investments; however, the impact was largely offset by the effect of cash redeployment. A strategic decision was made to reduce the tax exempt municipal bond portfolio exposure, resulting in an approximate decrease of $12 billion in the carrying value (30 percent) of this asset class during the course of the year.  Net Investment Income Income on private equity and hedge funds was approximately $1.3 billion (7 percent yield) in 2011, compared to $1.7 billion (9 percent yield) in 2010 which directionally followed the equity market trends as $1.2 billion of income was recognized in the first half of the year. Private equity funds drove the positive results in 2011 as hedge funds were only marginally positive for the year. In 2010, hedge funds and private equity funds each yielded approximately 9 percent. The fair value change for the Maiden Lane Interests turned negative in 2011 due to widening spread trends and negative changes in future cash flow projections. The fair value change for 2011 was a loss of $0.6 billion compared to a gain of $2.3 billion for 2010. The fair value of AIA ordinary shares increased by $1.3 billion as the stock price appreciated 11 percent in 2011 compared to a decrease in 2010 which resulted in a loss of $0.6 billion in 2010. The 11 percent appreciation on the stock compared favorably to the 20 percent decline experienced in the Hang Seng Index.  Unrealized and Realized Gains and Losses Lower yields across most asset classes resulted in an increase of approximately $5.5 billion of unrealized appreciation on AIGs available for sale securities in 2011. This was slightly lower than the 2010 period. 2010 benefited from improving economic conditions in the post recession period. Net realized gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities and equities totaled $2.1 billion in 2011 compared to $2.6 billion in 2010. Current year results consist primarily of gains on the sales of tax exempt municipal securities and corporate debt. Other than temporary impairments were $1.3 billion in 2011 compared to $3.0 billion in 2010, primarily related to impairments recorded on the mortgage backed, asset backed and collateralized portfolio in both periods. The credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect for AIGs fixed maturity investments: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies or where agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 97 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIGs equivalent internal ratings where these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. AIG changed to a composite ratings methodology during 2011 in order to reduce reliance on any single rating agency, and ratings information for prior periods presented has been conformed to this method. The "Non rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIGs interest in ML III. See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.

AIG 2011 Form 10 K 143 Table of Contents  Chartis In AIGs general insurance business, the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than other lines. As differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies, the focus is not on asset liability matching, but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus. Fixed income holdings of Chartis domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.3 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities, which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds, government bonds and agency and corporate securities. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher. Fixed income assets held in Chartis foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4 years. While invested assets backing reserves are invested in conventional fixed income securities in Chartis domestic operations, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to large capitalization, high dividend, public equity strategies and to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. Notwithstanding the current environment, these investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns over time.  SunAmerica With respect to SunAmerica companies, AIG uses asset liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets. AIGs objective is to maintain a matched asset liability structure, although AIG may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position. To the extent that AIG has maintained a matched asset liability structure, the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated. AIGs investment strategy for SunAmerica is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities. There exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. SunAmerica frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business. The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products. The fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. SunAmerica manages its exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. SunAmerica actively reviews underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees. SunAmerica has taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees. SunAmerica executes listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products. SunAmerica also enters into various types of futures and options contracts, primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates. SunAmerica uses several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, including listed futures on government securities, listed options on government securities and, beginning in 2012, the purchase of government securities. With respect to over the counter derivatives, SunAmerica deals with highly rated counterparties and does not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. SunAmerica has controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and 144 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. SunAmerica generally uses ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.  Other Operations  Global Capital Markets The active wind down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. AIGFP derivative transactions are carried at fair value. AIGFP reduces its market risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. For discussion on the use of derivatives by AIGFP, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Direct Investment book The DIB, which includes the Matched Investment Program and non derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP, was originally created to generate spread income from investments yielding greater returns than the related cost of funds. The DIBs investment portfolio, which has a carrying value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $27.5 billion, consists primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans, mortgage loans and equity securities. Although the DIB is in wind down, the investment strategy remains focused on maximizing the value of the portfolio while producing sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations of the DIB. The management of the DIB investment portfolio seeks to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risk associated with the investment strategy by utilizing derivatives. The use of these derivatives does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; although, management believes these provide appropriate economic hedges of the underlying risk within the investment portfolio. Further, management seeks to maximize the value of the investment portfolio through an ongoing evaluation of each position in determining whether to hold, sell or finance the investments in furtherance of the strategy, which includes both immediate and long term liquidity needs. The investments of the DIB are all generally carried at fair value with the exception of loans and notes receivable held by MIP of $1.1 billion, which are carried at amortized cost and evaluated for impairment each period. The investments of AIGFP are generally subject to the fair value option with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The investments within the MIP are generally available for sale securities, where changes in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments, net of taxes, as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income which are subject to impairment review each period.

The value of the AIA shares will fluctuate until the ultimate disposition by AIG of the AIA shares. The value of the AIA shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of AIA. The agreement with the underwriters precludes AIG from entering into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of one half of its remaining interest in AIA through April 18, 2012.

Determinations of other than temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized. AIG recorded other than temporary impairment charges in 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to: securities for which AIG has changed its intent from hold to sell; declines due to foreign exchange rates; issuer specific credit events; certain structured securities; other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts; and securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. With respect to the issuer specific credit events shown above, no other than temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other than temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.2 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent of total equity in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 156 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $542 million, $401 million and $735 million, respectively. For a discussion of recent accounting standards affecting fair values and other than temporary impairments, see Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. (e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary. For 2011, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $5.4 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads. As of December 31, 2011, the majority of AIGs fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for 12 months or more consisted of the unrealized loss of $464 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 24 securities with an amortized cost of $70 million and a net unrealized loss of $40 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 157  Table of Contents AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of AIGs investment portfolio.  ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW Risk management is a key element of AIGs approach to corporate governance. AIG has an integrated process for managing risks throughout the organization. AIGs Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. AIGs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of AIGs major business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view on the firms major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM.  RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AIGs risk governance fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. It is supported by committees at the AIG corporate level and in each business unit. AIGs Board of Directors oversees management of risk through the complementary functioning of its Finance and Risk Management Committee (the FRMC) and the Audit Committee, and interaction with other committees of the Board. AIGs Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the FRMC and AIGs Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimize its intrinsic value, and protect its reputation among key stakeholders. The GRC is chaired by AIGs CRO and its membership includes AIGs CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel, and 11 additional executives from across AIGs corporate functions and business units. AIGs CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the FRMC and the Audit Committee of the Board. Management committees that support the GRC are as follows: the Financial Risk Group (the FRG); the Transaction Approval and Business Practices Committee (the TABPC); the Operational Risk Committee (the ORC); and the Risk and Capital Committees of AIGs major insurance business segments, SunAmerica, Chartis and UGC. The committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of control functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and resolving specific risk matters within their respective mandate. The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and its subsidiaries. The FRGs mandate includes oversight of the firms aggregate risks related to credit, asset liability management and liquidity, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. Membership of the FRG includes AIGs Executive Vice President Investments and Financial Services and Executive Vice President and Treasurer, as well as its CFO, and other senior executives from Finance and ERM. AIGs CRO serves as Chair of the FRG. 158 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The TABPC provides the primary corporate level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. AIGs Executive Vice President and Treasurer serves as Chair of the committee that also includes AIGs General Counsel, the AIG CRO, CFO, Executive Vice President Investments and Financial Services, and a senior executive from Finance. The ORC is tasked with identifying the risks that may arise from adverse outcomes that stem from internal processes, people, systems, or external events. AIGs Chief Administrative Officer is Chair of the ORC and he is joined by senior AIG executives with expertise in legal, compliance, technology and operational risk, as well as the chief risk officers of key AIG business units. Each of AIGs major insurance businesses has established committees that are responsible for managing risks at the individual business unit level: Chartis Risk & Capital Committee (CRCC): The CRCC is co chaired by the Chartis CRO and Chief Financial Officer and consists of Chartis executive management, the AIG CRO and the AIG Chief Actuary. The CRCC mandate encompasses the identification, monitoring and control of all sources of risk within the global Chartis portfolio, including emerging and catastrophic risks. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerance, approving capital management strategies (including asset allocation and risk financing), insurance portfolio optimization and providing oversight of economic capital models. Each major geographic region of the Chartis footprint maintains a local committee with a similar mandate that reports directly or indirectly to the CRCC. SunAmerica Financial Group Risk & Capital Committee (SARCC): The SARCC is co chaired by the SunAmerica CRO and the SunAmerica CEO and consists of SunAmerica executive management, the AIG CRO and the AIG Chief Actuary. The scope of SARCC responsibilities encompasses the identification, monitoring and control of all sources of risk within SAFG and includes financial, capital, liquidity and insurance risks. The SARCC creates and implements all risk management policies and oversees all risk assessment processes. It reviews strategic and financial initiatives and activities as recommended by its various business units and functional groups. UGC Risk Committee (URC): The URC is chaired by the UGC CRO who reports regularly to the AIG CRO and the UGC executive committee. The URC creates, oversees and implements UGCs risk management framework and establishes the policies and guiding principles for managing risk across the UGC portfolio.  RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT AND TOLERANCE AIGs risk tolerance is reflected in its business planning and integrated into the management of its operations. AIGs GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is presented to the FRMC by the AIG CRO. AIG uses a proprietary stress testing framework to measure its quantifiable risks. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. This framework measures the risk in each of AIG 2011 Form 10 K 159 Table of Contents AIGs regulated subsidiaries in relation to its statutory capital needs under stress, as well as the risks inherent in AIGs unregulated subsidiaries. To complement existing processes, in 2011 AIG implemented an enterprise wide vulnerability identification process (VID) to facilitate the escalation of potential new or emerging risks to senior management. AIGs VID process, on a quarterly basis, solicits this information from a broad range of senior managers across the organization. Through VID, vulnerabilities not captured by other risk management practices are identified and elevated to senior management on a regular basis. AIGs approach to evaluating and managing risk divides material risk topics as follows: Credit risk the potential loss arising from an obligors inability or unwillingness to meet its obligations to AIG. Market risk the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity and commodity prices, and their levels of volatility. Market risk includes credit spread risk, the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in credit spreads of securities or counterparties. Operational risk the potential loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. Liquidity risk the potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they become due. General insurance risk the potential loss resulting from inadequate premiums, insufficient reserves and catastrophic exposures. Life insurance risk the potential loss resulting from experience deviating from expectations for mortality, morbidity and termination rates in the insurance oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities in the retirement savings products. Reputational risk the risk of direct loss or loss in future business because of damage to AIGs reputation. Damage to the Companys reputation can arise from a large number of issues, including potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, and sales and trading practices.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AIG devotes considerable resources to managing its direct and indirect credit exposures, such as those arising from fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk to derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, cessions of insurance risk to customers, credit risk assumed through credit derivatives written, financial guarantees and letters of credit. Credit risk is defined as the risk that AIGs customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also be manifested: (i) through the downgrading of credit ratings of counterparties whose credit instruments AIG may be holding, or, in some cases, insuring, causing the value of the assets to decline or insured risks to rise; and (ii) as cross border risk where a country (sovereign government risk) or one or more non sovereign obligors within a country are unable or unwilling to repay an obligation or are unable or unwilling to provide foreign exchange to service a credit or equity exposure incurred by another AIG business unit located outside that country. AIGs credit risks are managed at the corporate level within ERM, assisted by credit functions headed by seasoned credit officers in all the business units, whose primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in the context of the firms credit risk appetite. AIGs Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of credit risk policies and procedures. Detailed responsibilities are as follows: develop and implement AIG wide appropriate credit policies; approve delegated credit authorities to AIG credit executives; 160 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents manage the approval process for requests for credit limits, program limits and credit transactions above delegated authorities or where concentrations of risk may exist or be incurred; aggregate globally all credit exposure data by counterparty, country, sector and industry and report risk concentrations regularly to and review with senior management; administer regular portfolio credit reviews of investment, derivative and credit incurring business units and recommend corrective actions where required; conduct credit research on countries, sectors and asset classes where risk concentrations may exist; develop methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of AIGs internal risk rating process; and approve appropriate credit reserves, credit related other than temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios. AIG monitors and controls its company wide credit risk concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require third party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust accounts. These guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust accounts are also treated as credit exposure and are added to AIGs risk concentration exposure data. AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark to market and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties, commercial bank letters of credit received as collateral, guarantees, and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIGs reported credit exposures to a counterparty reflect available for sale investments, trading securities, derivative exposures, insurance credit and any other counterparty credit exposures. AIGs single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 34 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2011 compared to 22 percent at December 31, 2010. The increase reflects the effects of the Recapitalization on Total equity as well as increased exposure to the U.S. Government, including primarily credit exposure related to the U.S. Treasury bonds and government agencies and to the direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Based on AIGs internal risk ratings, at December 31, 2011, AIGs largest below investment grade rated credit exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity, compared to 0.6 percent at December 31, 2010. AIGs single largest industry credit exposure in 2011 was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of December 31, 2011, credit exposure to this sector was $108 billion, or 123 percent of Total equity compared to 119 percent at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011: $103 billion or 95 percent of these financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIGs internal ratings. $5 billion or 5 percent were considered non investment grade. Most of the non investment grade exposure was to financial institutions in countries AIG does not consider of investment grade quality. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade rated financial institutions was $2 billion. AIGs aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $40 billion. Short term bank deposit placements, reverse repos, repos and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank issued AIG 2011 Form 10 K 161 Table of Contents commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $18 billion of the total exposure, or 17 percent, to global financial institutions. The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, ordinary shares of AIA, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and the fronting of risk management policies to captive insurers of these financial institutions. Of the $108 billion aggregate financial exposure, $35.8 billion was to United Kingdom and European based financial institutions. $12.2 billion of this aggregate credit exposure was to non bank institutions, of which $9.5 billion, or 78 percent, was reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. $1.7 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non banks was fixed maturity securities. Approximately 98 percent of the non bank exposures were considered investment grade based on AIGs internal ratings. Aggregate credit exposures to United Kingdom and European based banks totaled $23.5 billion, of which $22.7 billion were considered investment grade based on AIGs internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade rated credit exposures to European banks were $793 million. AIGs credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro zone countries totaled $9.6 billion, of which $5.1 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $1.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.9 billion, of which $845 million were fixed maturity securities. AIGs credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.

Covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and which have full recourse to the issuing bank) represented approximately 10 percent of the $11.6 billion fixed maturity securities. 162 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents (b)Cash and short term investments include bank deposit placements, operating accounts, securities purchased under agreements to resell and collateral posted to counterparties against structured products. Credit equivalent exposure to securities purchased under agreements to resell was $86 million (notional value of $2.7 billion). (c)Derivative transactions reported at fair value. (d)Other primarily consists of commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures ($1.7 billion), captive programs in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands ($1.6 billion) Out of a total of $5.1 billion of fixed maturity securities of banks in the Euro zone countries, AIGs subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $1.2 billion and $386 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.

(b)Secured/government primarily includes covered bonds and securities issued by government sponsored entities or debt guaranteed by a government. AIG also had credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in recent months by one or more of the major rating agencies. These downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the Euro zone periphery (Spain, Italy and Portugal) where AIGs credit exposures totaled $339 million at December 31, 2011. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits, rising government debt to GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these sovereigns, which have given rise to widening credit spreads and difficult financing conditions. These credit exposures primarily included available for sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece or Ireland.

(b)United Kingdom/European exposure also consists of $345 million of subordinated debt, primarily in the United Kingdom and Switzerland; bank loans of $95 million; and preferred equity securities of $91 million. (c)Other primarily consists of insurance related products, including captive fronting programs ($8.1 billion), trade credit insurance ($3.8 billion) and surety insurance ($2.3 billion). Approximately 87 percent of fixed maturity securities in the United Kingdom and European non financial institutions were considered investment grade based on AIGs internal ratings. Among non financial institution corporate exposures to Euro zone countries, France represented the largest single country, amounting to $6.8 billion of the $20 billion total, of which $2.6 billion were fixed maturity securities. Approximately two thirds of these French exposures were to issuers in the oil and gas, rail, utilities and telecommunications industries. Euro zone periphery non financial institution corporate exposures ($5 billion) are heavily weighted towards large multinational corporate or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (26 percent), telecommunications (18 percent) and oil & gas (7 percent). AIG also had United Kingdom and European structured product exposures (largely residential mortgage backed, commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities) totaling $8.6 billion at December 31, 2011. United Kingdom structured products accounted for $4.2 billion or 48 percent of these exposures, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 23 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the European peripheral countries accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 90 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at December 31, 2011. See Critical Accounting Estimates Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Regulatory Capital Portfolio for a discussion of European related regulatory capital transactions. In addition, AIG had commercial real estate related net equity investments in Europe totaling $647 million and related unfunded commitments of $165 million. Moreover, ILFCs fleet includes aircraft on operating leases to U.K. and European airlines with a net book value of approximately $13.5 billion, of which approximately $3.1 billion or 23 percent are aircraft on lease to carriers based in the five Euro zone periphery countries. AIG actively monitors its European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the European periphery, and uses various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine whether mitigating actions should be taken. Mitigating actions in these areas to date have largely included non renewal of maturing exposures and sales and tender of securities. To date, credit default protection has not been actively used. The financial condition of issuers is periodically evaluated, and internal risk ratings are adjusted as circumstances warrant. The result of these continuing reviews has led AIG to believe that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments, financial institutions and non financial corporations in the Euro zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 165  Table of Contents AIG also monitors its aggregate cross border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross border exposures both aggregated cross border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Eight countries had cross border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Based on AIGs internal risk ratings, at December 31, 2011, five countries were rated AAA and three were rated AA. The two largest cross border exposures were to the United Kingdom and France. AIG also has a risk concentration, primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies, in the U.S. municipal sector. A majority of these securities were held in available for sale portfolios of AIGs domestic property casualty insurance companies. See Investments Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. AIG had $892 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios at December 31, 2011, compared to $974 million at December 31, 2010. These exposures consisted of AIGFP derivatives and trading securities (at fair value) and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations. See also Investments herein for further information. AIG reviews regularly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. AIG periodically adjusts limits and reviews exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that the Company does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIGs credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AIG is exposed to market risks, primarily within its insurance and capital markets businesses (see Item 1. Business Other Operations Global Capital Markets regarding its market risk issues). For AIGs insurance operations, the asset liability exposures are predominantly structural in nature, and not the result of speculative positioning to take advantage of short term market opportunities. For example, the business model of life insurance and retirement savings is to collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long term, credit based assets. A spread is earned over time between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders. The asset and liability profiles are managed so that the cash flows resulting from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market. In periods of severe market volatility, depressed and illiquid market values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders equity even without the realization of actual credit event related losses. Such diminution of capital strength has caused downward pressure on the markets assessment of the financial strength and the credit ratings of insurers. AIGs market exposures can be categorized as follows: Benchmark interest rates. Benchmark interest rates are also known as risk free interest rates and are associated with either the government/treasury yield curve or the swap curve. The fair value of AIGs significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change. Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default free instrument. Equity and alternative investment prices. AIGs exposure to equity and alternative investment prices arises from direct investments in common stocks and mutual funds, from minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and from other equity like investments, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, private equity investments, commercial real estate and real estate funds. Foreign currency exchange rates. AIG is a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. 166 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents AIG uses a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify its market risk exposure, including: Duration/key rate duration. Duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed income instrument to the parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve. Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world wide equity markets. Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis whereby the scenarios used are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome (for example, the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008). Stress testing is often used to address Value at Risk (VaR) shortcomings and complement VaR calculations. Particularly in times of significant volatility in financial markets, using stress scenarios provides more pertinent and forward looking information on market risk exposure than VaR results based upon historical data alone. VaR. VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time with a specified level of statistical confidence. VaR measures not only the size of individual exposures but also the interaction between different market exposures, thereby providing a portfolio approach to measuring market risk. A key shortcoming of the VaR approach is its reliance on historical data, making VaR calculations essentially "backward looking." This shortcoming was most evident during the recent credit crisis.  Insurance and Aircraft Leasing Sensitivities The following table provides estimates of AIGs sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates: As of December 31, (dollars in millions) Exposure Effect 2011 2010* Sensitivity Factor 2011 2010 Yield sensitive assets $ 326,200 $ 308,900 100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves $ (15,800) $ (13,400 ) Equity and alternative investments exposure $ 39,000 $ 46,400 20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments $ (7,800) $ (9,300 ) Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure $ 5,900 $ 3,400 10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar $ (590) $ (340 ) * All figures and periods have been adjusted to reflect the divestitures of AIG Star, AIG Edison, and Nan Shan, which occurred in 2011. Exposures to yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIGs consolidated non U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis. Comparisons of 2011 exposures to 2010 are as follows: Total yield sensitive assets increased 5.6 percent or $17.3 billion compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in fixed income assets of $34.9 billion. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and other assets of $17.6 billion. Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 15.9 percent or $7.4 billion compared to 2010, primarily due to: AIGs sale of MetLife equity securities ($6.5 billion) as well as decreases in mutual fund values ($1.5 billion), real estate investments ($416 million) and private equity funds and hedge funds values AIG 2011 Form 10 K 167 Table of Contents ($247 million). The decrease was partially offset by increases in other equity investments ($1.0 billion) and common equity securities ($247 million). Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 73.5 percent or $2.5 billion compared to 2010, primarily due to: unrealized appreciation of $1.3 billion from certain foreign denominated equity holdings; goodwill translation adjustment of $812 million; and a reduction in foreign denominated debt outstanding of $463 million. The increase was partially offset by a net decrease in all other currencies of $65 million. The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors utilized for 2011 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1991 to 2011, as follows (see the table below): a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten year treasury yield; a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rate.

ORM is responsible for establishing and maintaining the framework, principles and guidelines of AIGs operational risk management program. Each business unit is responsible for its operational risks and implementing the components of the operational risk management program to effectively identify, assess, monitor and mitigate such risks. This responsibility includes developing and implementing policies, procedures, management oversight processes, and other governance related activities consistent with AIGs overall operational risk management process. Senior operational risk executives in the businesses report to the Head of AIG ORM and to business management. This reporting structure facilitates development of business specific knowledge of operational risk matters, while at the same time maintaining company wide consistency in AIGs overall approach to operational risk management. A strong operational risk management program facilitates escalation and resolution of operational risk issues. In order to accomplish this, AIGs operational risk management program is designed to: pro actively address potential operational risk issues; create transparency at all levels of the organization; and assign clear ownership and accountability for addressing identified issues. 168 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents As part of the operational risk management framework, AIG has implemented a risk and control self assessment (RCSA) process. The RCSA process is used to identify key operational risks and evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls to mitigate those risks. Corrective action plans are developed to address any identified issues. Business units continue to enhance their RCSA processes to perform more robust risk assessments. The Operational Risk Management Forum, a company wide governance body comprised of senior ORM executives, including the senior business operational risk executives, meets regularly and provides a forum for approving operational risk policies and ensuring effectiveness of the operational risk management program.  BUSINESS UNIT RISK MANAGEMENT Other than as described above, AIG manages its business risk oversight activities through its operating segments.  Insurance Operations AIGs multiple insurance businesses conducted on a global basis expose AIG to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. These risks are managed throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures, including: pre launch approval of product design, development and distribution; underwriting approval processes and authorities; exposure limits with ongoing monitoring; modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events); compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets; extensive use of reinsurance, both internal and third party; and review and establishment of reserves. AIG closely manages insurance risk by overseeing and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums charged for taking on the risk. Concentrations of risk, including, but not limited to, wind, flood, earthquake, terrorism and accident are analyzed using various modeling techniques. AIG has two major categories of insurance risks as follows: Property and casualty (Chartis and Mortgage Guaranty) risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, management liability and mortgage insurance. Risks in the general insurance segment are managed through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, correlation and catastrophic risk events. Risks in the mortgage insurance business are managed through geographic location of the insured properties, the relative economic conditions in the local housing markets, credit attributes of the borrowers, and the loan amount relative to the value of the respective collateral. Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Service (SunAmerica) risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities in the retirement savings oriented products. Risks are managed through product design, sound medical underwriting, external traditional reinsurance programs and external catastrophe reinsurance programs. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its insurance operations. The use of reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). AIG may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of AIGs reinsurance risks enables AIG to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for Chartis and SunAmerica. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 169 Table of Contents  Chartis At Chartis, underwriting risks are managed through its risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self insured retentions, coverage limits and reinsurance. The risks covered by AIG are managed through sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis as part of the determination of overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures are based on historical experience, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. Climate change and related regulatory initiatives may increase both the frequency and severity of claims or the cost of defending such claims. Chartis policies are primarily written for periods of 12 months, providing Chartis with the ability to modify underwriting practices and pricing procedures; limiting the financial impact of such increase in claims. Each line of business and many individual policyholders may have different exposures to the effects of climate change. A primary goal of AIG in managing its Chartis operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection, premiums must be adequate, and terms and conditions must be appropriate to cover the risk accepted.  Catastrophe Exposures The nature of AIGs business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic events are one year contracts allowing AIG to quickly adjust its exposure to catastrophic events if climate changes or other events increase the frequency or severity of catastrophes. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect AIGs operating results. Other risks, such as a pandemic disease, like the Swine Flu Influenza A Virus (H1N1), could adversely affect AIGs business and operating results to the extent they are only partially offset by reinsurance programs. AIG evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of industry recognized models, among other techniques. AIG updates these models by periodically monitoring the exposure risks of AIGs worldwide Chartis operations and adjusting such models accordingly. Following is an overview of modeled losses for Chartis exposure associated with the more significant natural perils. The modeled results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to AIG in accordance with their terms. Chartis utilizes industry recognized catastrophe models. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Therefore, these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies. These estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect AIGs maximum exposures to these events. It is highly likely that AIGs losses will vary, perhaps significantly, from these estimates. The modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability (AEP) losses, which represent total property, workers compensation, and A&H losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events. The A&H data include exposures for United States and Japan earthquakes. These exposures represent the largest share of A&H exposures to earthquakes. A&H losses were modeled using April 2010 data. The property exposures were modeled with data as of September 2011. All reinsurance program structures, domestic and international, reflect the reinsurance programs in place as of January 1, 2012. The values 170 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents provided were based on 100 year return period losses, which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. Losses include loss adjustment expenses and the net values include reinstatement premiums. At December 31, 2011 (in millions) Gross Net of 2012 Reinsurance Net of 2012 Reinsurance, After Tax Percent of Total Equity Natural Peril: Earthquake $ 6,810 $ 4,101 $ 2,666 3.05% Tropical Cyclone* $ 8,495 $ 5,215 $ 3,389 3.88% * Includes hurricanes, typhoons and European windstorms. Gross earthquake and tropical cyclone modeled losses increased $511 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, compared to 2010, while net losses increased $406 million and $809 million, respectively, compared to 2010. These increases in both gross and net losses are primarily due to Risk Management Solutions (RMS) model changes, blending multiple model results (RMS, AIR Worldwide Corporation (AIR) and EQECAT, Inc.), data completeness and the implementation of a data quality index. In addition to the return period loss, AIG evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred. The single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by Lloyds (see Lloyds Realistic Disaster Scenarios, Scenario Specifications, January 2012) and referred to as Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDS). The purpose of this analysis is to utilize these RDS to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results. However, it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that AIG could incur from this type of an event in these regions. The losses associated with the RDS are included in the following table. Single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to AIGs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas are set forth below. Gross values represent AIGs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles and net values represent losses after reinsurance is applied. The net losses also include reinsurance reinstatement premiums. Both gross and net losses include loss adjustment expenses. At December 31, 2011 (in millions) Gross Net of 2012 Reinsurance Natural Peril: Northeast Hurricane $ 4,070 $ 2,726 Gulf Coast Hurricane $ 5,475 $ 3,135 Los Angeles Earthquake $ 6,216 $ 3,157 San Francisco Earthquake $ 6,364 $ 3,810 Miami Hurricane $ 4,977 $ 2,136 Japanese Earthquake $ 1,455 $ 680 European Windstorm $ 1,033 $ 502 Japanese Typhoon $ 992 $ 447 AIG also monitors key international property risks utilizing industry recognized natural catastrophe models. Based on the occurrence exceedance probabilities, the 100 year return period loss for Japanese Earthquake is $976 million gross and $514 million net; the 100 year return period loss for European Windstorm is $967 million gross and $612 million net; and the 100 year return period loss for Japanese Typhoon is $1.4 billion gross and $680 million net. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD ARE LIKELY TO VARY, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, FROM THE MODELED SCENARIOS, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE SEVERE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AIGS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 171 Table of Contents Terrorism Exposure to loss from terrorist attack is controlled by limiting the aggregate accumulation of workers compensation and property insurance that is underwritten within defined target locations. Modeling is used to provide projections of PML by target location based upon the actual exposures of AIG policyholders. Terrorism risk is monitored to manage AIGs exposure. AIG shares its exposures to terrorism risks under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA). During 2011, AIGs deductible under TRIPRA was approximately $2.9 billion, with a 15 percent share of certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible. As of January 1, 2012, the deductible was approximately $3 billion, with a 15 percent share of certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible.  Reinsurance AIG uses reinsurance programs for its insurance risks as follows: facultative agreements to cover large individual exposures; quota share treaties to cover specific books of business; excess of loss treaties to cover large losses; excess or surplus automatic treaties to cover individual life risks in excess of stated per life retention limits; and catastrophe treaties to cover specific catastrophes, including earthquake, windstorm and flood. AIG monitors its exposures to natural catastrophes and takes corrective actions to limit its exposure with respect to particular geographic areas, companies, or perils. The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the nature of the risks ceded to the reinsurers and the aggregation of total reinsurance recoverables ceded to reinsurers. Such assessments may include, but are not limited to: identifying whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed; has sufficient financial capacity and liquidity; and an evaluation of the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks and the need for credit risk mitigants or covenants. For example, in AIGs treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG frequently includes provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers which include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in statutory surplus below pre determined levels, decreases in NAIC risk based capital (RBC) below certain levels, or setting maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus the largest single peril limit for a reinsurer. In addition, AIGs credit executives within corporate ERM review all reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approves most large reinsurer credit limits above pre set limits that represent actual or potential credit concentrations. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIGs business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract. AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions for its Chartis and SunAmerica operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among AIGs various insurance company subsidiaries and to take advantage of economies of scale with external reinsurers. When required for statutory recognition, AIG obtains letters of credit from third party financial institutions to collateralize these intercompany transactions. A portion of the approximately $1.5 billion of letters of credit issued in favor of Chartis companies as at December 31, 2011, secures such intercompany transactions. Although reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates AIGs exposure to potentially significant losses. 172 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents AIG continually evaluates the reinsurance markets and the relative attractiveness of various arrangements for coverage, including structures such as catastrophe bonds, insurance risk securitizations, "sidecars" and similar vehicles.  Reinsurance Recoverable Chartis reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of: balances due from reinsurers for indemnity losses and loss expenses billed to, but not yet collected from, reinsurers (collectively, Paid Losses Recoverable); ultimate ceded reserves for indemnity losses and expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR (collectively, Ceded Loss Reserves); and ceded reserves for Unearned Premiums. At December 31, 2011, total reinsurance recoverable assets of $27.2 billion include general reinsurance Paid Losses Recoverable of $1.5 billion, Ceded Loss Reserves of $20.3 billion, and ceded reserves for Unearned Premiums of $3.9 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.5 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years and are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserves for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2011 reflect a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded. AIG manages the credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, providing for appropriate credit limits and diversification and, when necessary, AIG requires reinsurers to post collateral in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2011, approximately 57 percent of the reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. More than 51 percent of these balances were collateralized, permitting statutory recognition. The remaining 43 percent of the reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. At December 31, 2011, approximately 88 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A (strong) or better, as rated by S&P. These ratings are measures of financial strength. The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of AIGs total General Reinsurance Recoverable assets: At December 31, 2011 (in millions) S&P Rating(a) A.M.

(b)Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable treaty balances. (c)Total Reinsurance Assets include general and life reinsurance recoverable. The estimation of general reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for asbestos exposures, due to their long tail nature. Chartis assesses the collectability of its general reinsurance recoverable balances through detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance, including paid AIG 2011 Form 10 K 173 Table of Contents and unpaid recoverables, whether the balance is in dispute or a legal collection status, whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction), whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist, and the credit quality of the underlying reinsurer. Detailed reviews of the underlying receivables are particularly important when assessing recoverables attributable to long tail exposures. Under the terms and conditions of the reinsurance agreement between Chartis and NICO, NICO assumed the collection risk on Chartis third party reinsurance recoverables related to the covered asbestos risks. Adjustments to reflect the results of the detailed review are recorded through an allowance for uncollectable general reinsurance. At December 31, 2011, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable general reinsurance was $365 million. At December 31, 2011, AIG had no significant general reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. In the current environment of weaker economic conditions and strained financial markets, certain reinsurers are reporting losses and could be subject to rating downgrades. AIGs general reinsurance recoverable exposures are primarily to the regulated subsidiaries of such companies which are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements. The RCD, in conjunction with AIG credit executives within corporate ERM, is reviewing these developments, is monitoring compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and, as appropriate, will seek to use other means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.  SunAmerica For SunAmerica, the primary risks are the following: Pricing risk, which represents the potential exposure to loss resulting from actual policy experience emerging adversely in comparison to the assumptions made in product pricing associated with investment results, mortality, morbidity, surrenders and expenses; Investment risk, which represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets being less than cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments; Interest rate risk, which represents the exposure to loss due to the sensitivity of the liabilities and assets to changes in interest rates; and Equity market risk, which represents the potential exposure to higher claim costs for guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities and the potential reduction in expected fee revenue. SunAmericas businesses manage these risks through product design, exposure limitations and the active management of the asset liability relationship in their operations. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For a further discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Adjustments to Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Future Policy Benefits. SunAmerica companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to $15 million or less of coverage, in certain circumstances by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. For SunAmerica companies, the reinsurance programs provide risk mitigation per life for individuals and group and for catastrophic risk events.  Aircraft Leasing AIGs Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the re marketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFCs own account and re marketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial institutions. Risks inherent in this business, which are managed at the business unit level, include the following: the risk that there will be no market for the aircraft acquired; the risk that aircraft cannot be placed with lessees; 174 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents the risk of non performance by lessees; the risk that aircraft and related assets cannot be disposed of at the time and in a manner desired; and the risk of losses on sales or impairment charges and fair value adjustments on older aircraft. The airline industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and is cyclical and highly competitive. Airlines and related companies may be affected by political or economic instability, terrorist activities, changes in national policy, competitive pressures, fuel prices and shortages, labor stoppages, pilot shortages, insurance costs, recessions, health concerns and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets. ILFCs revenues and pre tax income may be adversely affected by the volatile competitive environment in which its customers operate. ILFC is exposed to pre tax loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it may be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration, and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it may be unable to lease. As part of its ongoing fleet strategy, ILFC may pursue the sale or part out of aircraft while balancing the need for funds with the long term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives. Significant uncertainties could exist as to the aircraft comprising any actual sale portfolio, the terms of any sale portfolio (including price), and whether any portfolio sale will be approved. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries Aircraft Leasing herein for further discussion. To date ILFC manages the risk of nonperformance by its lessees with security deposit requirements, repossession rights, overhaul requirements and close monitoring of industry conditions through its marketing force. More than 94 percent of ILFCs lease revenue came from non U.S. carriers, and its fleet continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFCs management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFCs fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on these events and circumstances. As new and more fuel efficient aircraft enter the marketplace and negatively affect the demand for older aircraft, lease rates on older aircraft may deteriorate and ILFC may incur additional losses on sales or record impairment charges and fair value adjustments. ILFC recognized asset impairment charges and fair value adjustments related to its fleet in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $51 million, respectively.  Other Operations  Global Capital Markets The active wind down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. As a consequence of its wind down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio. Prior to the wind down, AIGFP engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. Historically, AIGFP derived a significant portion of its revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. Prior to the wind down, AIGFP also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFPs operations. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to monitor on an ongoing basis the various financial market, operational and credit risk attendant to AIGFPs operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIGFP actively manages its exposures to limit potential economic losses, and in doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 175  Table of Contents AIGFP Derivative Transactions A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. To help manage this risk, AIGFPs credit department operates within the guidelines set by the CRM. Transactions that fall outside these pre established guidelines require the specific approval of the CRM. It is also AIGs policy to record credit valuation adjustments for potential counterparty default when necessary. In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the transactions size and maturity. Furthermore, AIGFP generally seeks to enter into agreements that have the benefit of set off and close out netting provisions. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP can set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values. The fair value of AIGFPs interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported in Derivative assets, at fair value, was approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective master netting agreements. AIGFP evaluates the counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from rating agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis consistent with the risk rating policies of the CRM. In addition, AIGFPs credit approval process involves pre set counterparty and country credit exposure limits subject to approval by the CRM and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, requires approval from the CRM. The following table presents the fair value of AIGFPs derivatives portfolios by counterparty credit rating: At December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Rating: AAA $ 260 $ 310 AA 58 885 A 1,156 1,170 BBB 2,081 1,625 Below investment grade 247 795 Total $ 3,802 $ 4,785 See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion related to derivative transactions. AIGFP Trading VaR AIGFP attempts to minimize risk in benchmark interest rates, equities, commodities and foreign exchange. Market exposures in option implied volatilities, correlations and basis risks are also managed over time. AIGFPs minimal reliance on market risk driven revenue is reflected in its VaR. AIGFPs VaR calculation is based on the interest rate, equity, commodity and foreign exchange risk arising from its portfolio. Credit related factors, such as credit spreads or credit default, are not included in AIGFPs VaR calculation. Because the non credit market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of the financial instruments into trading and other than trading was not considered necessary. AIGFP operates under established market risk limits based upon this VaR calculation. In addition, AIGFP back tests its VaR. 176 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents In the calculation of VaR for AIGFP, AIG uses the historical simulation methodology based on estimated changes to the value of all transactions under explicit changes in market rates and prices within a specific historical time period. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services, such as Bloomberg or Reuters, or third party or broker quotes. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology that includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not deviated from these models in any material respect. AIGFP reports its VaR level using a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, facilitating risk comparison with AIGFPs trading peers and reflecting the fact that market risks can be actively assumed and offset in AIGFPs trading portfolio. The following table presents the year end, average, high, and low VaRs on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for AIGFPs operations. The diversified VaR is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of: estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax asset; recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), flight equipment, and reinsurance; insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts; estimated gross profits for investment oriented products; impairment charges, including other than temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments; liabilities for legal contingencies; and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including CDS and AIGs economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIGs financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 177 Table of Contents The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below.  RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET: AIG considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate. The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. AIGs framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability, the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, and AIGs emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. The framework requires AIG to consider all available evidence, including: the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years; the sustainability of recent operating profitability of AIGs subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions; the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset; the carryforward periods for the net operating loss (NOL), capital loss and foreign tax credit (FTC) carryforwards, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences; and, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets. During 2011, AIG experienced significant favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind down of AIGFPs portfolios, the sale of certain businesses, emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and a return to sustainable operating profits within its primary operations. During 2011, AIGs level of profitability, excluding the $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt in January, confirmed its return to sustainable operating profit for the full year. This, together with the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and projections of sufficient future taxable income, represents significant positive evidence. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the historical negative evidence regarding the likelihood that the deferred tax asset for AIGs U.S. consolidated income tax group (other than the life insurance business capital loss carryforwards) will be realized. This assessment was evidenced by AIG meeting all of the criteria in its framework, resulting in its conclusion that $16.6 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for AIGs U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released in 2011. The life insurance business capital loss carryforwards may be realized in the future if and when, either capital gains are realized or when prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are identified that result in an assessment that the life insurance business capital loss carryforwards will be realized on a more likely than not basis prior to the expiration of such capital loss carryforwards. In order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the NOLs, FTCs and nonlife capital loss carryforwards related to the $16.6 billion valuation allowance release, AIG considered its forecasts of future income for each of its businesses using comparisons to historical results, and actual and planned business and operational changes, which included assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG specific conditions and events. AIG also subjected the forecasts to stresses (considering various adverse AIG specific and macro economic risks) of key assumptions and evaluated the effect on tax attribute utilization. Management also stressed its assumptions related to the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. AIGs income forecasts coupled with its tax planning strategies (as well as stressed scenarios), all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes (other than life insurance business capital loss carryforwards) prior to their expiration. 178 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents  U.S. INCOME TAXES ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES: Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries, as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.  DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS SHORT DURATION (CHARTIS AND MORTGAGE GUARANTY): Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months for short duration insurance contracts. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, anticipated maintenance costs and unamortized DAC. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its Chartis domestic and international operations exceeded the sum of these costs at December 31, 2011, by 1 percent and 19 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the DAC of these operations was considered to be recoverable. Short duration DAC for Chartis domestic and international operations amounted to $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011.  FLIGHT EQUIPMENT RECOVERABILITY (AIRCRAFT LEASING): Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and lease periods and estimated residual or disposal values of each aircraft based on expectations regarding the use of the aircraft and market participants.  LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (CHARTIS AND MORTGAGE GUARANTY): AIG uses numerous assumptions in determining its best estimate of reserves for each class of business. The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both class of business and accident year. If actual experience differs from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, D&O or primary and excess workers compensation. The key assumptions that could have a material impact on loss reserves are as follows: Loss trend factors, which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2011 for the year end 2011 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 179 Table of Contents Loss development factors, which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years. The sensitivity analysis presented below addresses each major class of business for which a material deviation from AIGs overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible, and uses what AIG believes is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each class. There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve development will be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, or that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business. The following table summarizes the sensitivity analyses that estimate the effect on the loss reserve position of using alternative loss cost trend or loss development factor assumptions rather than those actually used in determining AIGs estimates in the year end loss reserve analyses in 2011. December 31, 2011 (in millions) Effect on Loss Reserves Effect on Loss Reserves Loss cost trends: Loss development factors: Excess casualty: Excess casualty: 10 percent increase $ 3,100 4.5 percent increase $ 1,300 10 percent decrease (2,400 ) 5.1 percent decrease (1,200 ) D&O: D&O: 20 percent increase 850 10 percent increase 750 15 percent decrease (550 ) 7 percent decrease (500 ) Excess workers compensation: Excess workers compensation: 5 percent increase 400 Increase(b) 1,300 5 percent decrease (250 ) Decrease(b) (850 ) Primary workers compensation(a): Primary workers compensation: 7.2 percent increase 2,200 3.4 percent decrease (1,000 ) (a) Loss cost trend assumption does not have a material impact for this line of business. (b) Percentages not applicable due to extremely long tailed nature of workers compensation. Alternative Loss Cost Trend and Loss Development Factor Assumptions by Class of Business For classes of business other than the classes discussed below, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor assumptions. However, the effect of such deviations is expected to be less material when compared to the effect on the classes noted above and discussed below. Loss Cost Trends: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by AIG to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years whereas actual loss cost trends exceeded the figures cited above for several other years. Thus, there can be no assurance that loss trends will not deviate by more than amounts noted above and discussed below. Loss Development Factors: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by AIG to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. Except for excess workers compensation, the assumed loss development factors are a key assumption. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss 180 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents development. However there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below. Class of Business Loss Cost Trend Loss Development Factor Excess Casualty The assumed loss cost trend was approximately five percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2011 loss reserve review for excess casualty will range from negative five percent to positive 15 percent, or approximately 10 percent lower or higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year end 2011 reserve review. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the excess casualty class of business due to the long tail nature of the claims and therefore is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims. After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 5.1 percent below those actually utilized in the year end 2011 reserve review to approximately 4.5 percent above those factors actually utilized. Excess casualty is a long tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims. D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of Business The assumed loss cost trend was approximately one percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of recent claims relating to the credit crisis, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2011 loss reserve review for these classes will range from negative 14 percent to positive 21 percent, or approximately 15 percent lower or 20 percent higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year end 2011 reserve review. Because the D&O class of business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. The assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption but less critical than for excess casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for excess casualty. However, the high severity nature of the claims does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for these classes of business for accident years since the early 1990s, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 7 percent lower to 10 percent higher than those factors actually utilized in the year end 2011 loss reserve review for these classes. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 181 Table of Contents Class of Business Loss Cost Trend Loss Development Factor Excess Workers Compensation Loss costs were trended at six percent per annum. After reviewing actual industry loss trends for the past ten years, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2011 loss reserve review for excess workers compensation will range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. Excess workers compensation is an extremely long tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. After evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up claim projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development for excess workers compensation could increase the current reserves by up to approximately $1.3 billion or decrease them by approximately $850 million. Primary Workers Compensation The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to AIGs loss reserves. This is primarily because AIGs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers compensation business. Generally, AIGs actual historical workers compensation loss development factors would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. However, workers compensation is a long tail class of business, and AIGs business reflects a very significant volume of losses, particularly in recent accident years. After evaluating the actual historical loss development since the 1980s for this business, in AIGs judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will fall within the range of approximately 3.4 percent below to 7.2 percent above those actually utilized in the year end 2011 loss reserve review. See Results of Operations Segment Results Chartis Operations Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense herein for additional information on AIGs reserve for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. 182 AIG 2011 Form 10 K  Table of Contents  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE AND ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACTS (SUNAMERICA COMPANIES): Periodically, AIG evaluates estimates used in establishing liabilities for Future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts, which include liabilities for certain payout annuities. AIG also evaluates estimates used in amortizing Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC), Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) and Sales Inducement Assets (SIA) for these products. These estimates are evaluated against actual experience and adjusted based on management judgment regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. For long duration traditional business, a "lock in" principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. These assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. The key assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are: Investment returns: which vary by year of issuance and products. Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience modified to allow for variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution channel. As AIG experience changes over time, the assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes. Because of the long term nature of many of AIGs liabilities subject to the "lock in" principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency. If observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing, DAC is adjusted through amortization expense, and additional liabilities are recorded through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Loss recognition testing is performed at an aggregate SunAmerica reporting segment level. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced (i.e., a DAC unlocking), and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock in principle. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. These estimates are also used to determine whether to adjust DAC and record additional liabilities when unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income, at each balance sheet date, as if the securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments. AIGs future policy benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB). The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected fees. The estimates incorporate assumptions including interest rates, mortality rates, lapse rates and stochastically generated investment returns. In addition to GMDB, AIGs future policy benefits include, to a lesser extent, guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB). The GMIB liability is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of the annuitization benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG periodically evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. AIG also issues certain variable annuity products that offer optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). These living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. The fair value estimates of the living benefit guarantees include assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility and policyholder behavior. AIG also incorporates its own risk of non performance in the valuation of the embedded policy derivatives. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how AIG incorporates its own non performance risk. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 183 Table of Contents AIG has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of GMWB and GMAV liabilities caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. The program utilizes hedging instruments, including derivatives such as equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap contracts, and is designed so that changes in value of the hedging instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities. AIG monitors daily, and rebalances as needed, the hedging positions in relation to the change in valuation of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities. However, differences between the change in fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities and the hedging instruments can be caused by extreme and unanticipated movements in the equity markets, interest rates and market volatility, policyholder behavior, statutory capital considerations and constraints and the ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade off. None of the derivative instruments described above are designated for hedge accounting. Approximately 48 percent of AIGs individual variable annuity account values contain either a GMWB rider or a GMAV rider as of December 31, 2011. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase AIGs exposure to potential benefits under the GMWB and GMAV contracts, leading to an increase in the existing liability for those benefits. AIGs exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holders account balance is below the guaranteed withdrawal or account value amount. As of December 31, 2011, AIGs exposure to the guaranteed withdrawal and account value amount under GMWB and GMAV was $1.4 billion and $27 million, respectively. However, the only way the GMWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for lifetime GWWB products, the annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over account value. The net impact of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, as well as the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is included in Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses). For a further discussion of the risks of AIGs unhedged exposures, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Guarantees Within Variable Annuities.  ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS FOR INTEREST SENSITIVE PRODUCTS (SUNAMERICA COMPANIES): Estimated gross profits (EGP) are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. EGP is composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains and losses. When assumptions are changed, the percentage of EGP used to amortize DAC might also change. In estimating EGP, AIG makes certain assumptions regarding the investment returns to be generated, market interest rates and mortality rates. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially change the amortization of DAC and related balances. 184 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions in the amortization of DAC/SIA, guaranteed benefits reserve and unearned revenue liability and the related hypothetical impact on year end 2011 balances. The effect of changes in the equity markets, volatility and interest rates primarily impacts individual variable annuities (SunAmerica Retirement Markets) and group retirement products (VALIC). The effect of changes in mortality primarily impacts the universal life insurance business.

(b)Represents the net impact of 1 percentage point increase or decrease in implied volatility. (c)Represents the net impact of a 10 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Does not represent interest rate spread compression. The analysis of DAC, guaranteed benefits reserve and unearned revenue liability is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. Each of the factors set forth above is estimated individually, without consideration of any correlation among the key assumptions. An assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.  OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES: At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses. See the discussion in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by security type, that AIG uses to determine the amount of other than temporary impairment on fixed maturity and equity securities.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT: Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment assessment involves a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level. Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIGs reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting units fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the units peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third party indications of AIG 2011 Form 10 K 185 Table of Contents fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit is potentially impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess. During 2011, Chartis finalized its reorganization, operating design and related segment reporting changes. In connection with this reorganization, total goodwill of $1.4 billion was allocated between Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on their relative fair values as of September 30, 2011. Management tested the allocated goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair values of the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reporting units exceeded book value at both September 30, and December 31, 2011 and therefore the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired. AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances, including Chartis operating results that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.  LIABILITY FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES: AIG estimates and records a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many such proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, AIG often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters.  REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES: In the ordinary course of business, AIGs general insurance and life insurance companies enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies to provide greater diversification of AIGs business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. AIG determines what portion of the losses will be recoverable under the reinsurance policies by reference to the terms of the reinsurance protection purchased. This determination is necessarily based on the underlying loss estimates and, accordingly, is subject to the same uncertainties as the estimate of loss reserves noted above. The sensitivity analysis presented above in the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses section is performed net of reinsurance, and therefore includes the variability of the key assumptions used in estimating reinsurance recoverables. There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve development will be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, or that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business. AIGs third party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and establishes limits per reinsurer. In the current environment of weaker economic conditions and strained financial markets, certain reinsurers are reporting losses and could be subject to rating downgrades. AIGs reinsurance recoverable exposures are primarily to the regulated subsidiaries of such companies which are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements. AIGs RCD, in conjunction with AIGs credit executives within corporate ERM, regularly reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require 186 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents the reinsurer to post collateral, and, as appropriate, seeks to use other means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIGs business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurer. General Insurance assesses the collectability of its reinsurance recoverable balances through detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance, including paid and unpaid recoverables, whether the balance is in dispute or a legal collection status, whether the insurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction), whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist, and the credit quality of the underlying insurer. Detailed reviews of the underlying receivables are particularly important when assessing recoverables attributable to long tail exposures. Adjustments to reflect the results of the detailed review are recorded through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $365 million and $492 million, respectively. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and or letters of credit. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Reinsurance.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES: See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIGs accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements. The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination: At December 31, 2011 (in billions) Fair Value Percent of Total Fair value based on external sources(a) $ 263 90 % Fair value based on internal sources 29 10 Total fixed income and equity securities(b) $ 292 100 % (a) Includes $20.9 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes. (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability. At December 31, 2011, AIG classified $39.4 billion and $5.3 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 7.1 percent and 1.2 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, AIG classified $36.3 billion and $6.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 5.3 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIGs assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment. AIG values certain assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield AIG 2011 Form 10 K 187 Table of Contents curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the certain classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the valuation methodologies for other assets classified in Level 3, including certain fixed maturity securities and certain other invested assets, as well as discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.  Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III At their inception, AIGs interests in ML II and ML III were valued and recorded at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the valuation methodologies applied to ML II and ML III since inception and sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the Maiden Lane Interests.  AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions. The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class: Net Notional Amount Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at December 31, Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss) Years Ended December 31, December 31, (in millions) 2011(a) 2010(a) 2011(b)(c) 2010(b)(c) 2011(c) 2010(c) Regulatory Capital: Corporate loans $ 1,830 $ 5,193 $ $ $ $ Prime residential mortgages(d) 3,653 31,613 (190 ) 6 53 Other 887 1,263 9 17 8 4 Total 6,370 38,069 9 (173 ) 14 57 Arbitrage: Multi sector CDOs(e) 5,476 6,689 3,077 3,484 249 663 Corporate debt/CLOs(f) 11,784 12,269 127 171 44 (67 ) Total 17,260 18,958 3,204 3,655 293 596 Mezzanine tranches(d)(g) 989 2,823 10 198 32 (55 ) Total $ 24,619 $ 59,850 $ 3,223 $ 3,680 $ 339 $ 598 (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(d)During 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated all of the related mezzanine tranches and hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. The transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair values at the time of termination. (e)During 2011, AIGFP liquidated one multi sector super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $188 million. The primary underlying collateral components, which consisted of individual ABS CDS transactions, were sold in an auction to counterparties, including AIGFP, at their approximate fair value at the time of the liquidation. AIGFP was the winning bidder on approximately $107 million of individual ABS CDS transactions, which are reported in written single name credit default swaps as of December 31, 2011. During 2011, AIGFP also paid $37 million to its counterparties with respect to multi sector CDOs. Multi sector CDOs also include $4.6 billion and $5.5 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. 188 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents (f)Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 0.86 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. However, during 2011, AIGFP terminated mezzanine tranches and the hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, all of which related to certain super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their values at the time of termination. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFPs financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame. The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio decreased as of December 31, 2011 by approximately 2.3 years from December 31, 2010 due to the termination of two transactions that had a longer than average weighted average maturity. Because the remaining counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the relevant rules under Basel I will remain effective. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under Basel I rules and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions. During 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated all of the related mezzanine tranches and hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. These transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair value at the time of termination. In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties early termination rights, and AIGFPs expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.  Arbitrage Portfolio A portion of the AIGFP super senior credit default swaps as of December 31, 2011 are arbitrage motivated transactions written on multi sector CDOs or designated pools of investment grade senior unsecured corporate debt or CLOs. 190 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Multi Sector CDOs The following table summarizes gross transaction notional amount of the multi sector CDOs on which AIGFP wrote protection on the super senior tranche, subordination below the super senior risk layer, net notional amount and fair value of derivative liability by underlying collateral type: December 31, 2011 (in millions) Gross Transaction Notional Amount(a) Subordination Below the Super Senior Risk Layer Net Notional Amount Fair Value of Derivative Liability High grade with subprime collateral $ 2,586 $ 1,325 $ 1,261 $ 550 High grade with no subprime collateral 3,158 1,223 1,935 760 Total high grade(b) 5,744 2,548 3,196 1,310 Mezzanine with subprime collateral 2,112 628 1,484 1,131 Mezzanine with no subprime collateral 1,483 687 796 636 Total mezzanine(c) 3,595 1,315 2,280 1,767 Total $ 9,339 $ 3,863 $ 5,476 $ 3,077 (a) Total outstanding principal amount of securities held by a CDO. (b)"High grade" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand alone basis were predominantly AA or higher at origination. (c)"Mezzanine" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand alone basis were predominantly A or lower at origination. Corporate Debt/CLOs The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS. These CDS transactions require cash settlement. This portfolio also includes CDS with a net notional amount of $1.2 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of CLOs, which require physical settlement.  Collateral Most of the AIGFP credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector CDOs. Collateral Calls AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage. From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFPs estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 191 Table of Contents The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions): (in millions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Regulatory capital $ 9 $ 236 Arbitrage multi sector CDO 2,711 3,013 Arbitrage corporate 477 537 Total $ 3,197 $ 3,786 The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIGs credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. AIGFP estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with its super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIGs liquidity planning assumptions.  Valuation Sensitivity Arbitrage Portfolio Multi Sector CDOs AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIGs calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs decreased during 2011. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions. For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $5.5 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi sector CDOs outstanding at December 31, 2011, a BET value is available for $3.6 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.9 billion of CDS written on European multi sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $3.6 billion. The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time. 192 AIG 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at December 31, 2011 corresponding to changes in these key inputs: Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability Average Inputs Used at December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions) Change Entire Portfolio RMBS Prime RMBS Alt A RMBS Subprime CMBS CDOs Other Bond prices 31 points Increase of 5 points $ (238 ) $ (3 ) $ (16 ) $ (99 ) $ (85 ) $ (24 ) $ (11 ) Decrease of 5 points 225 4 16 90 82 19 14 Weighted Increase of 1 year 29 1 22 3 2 1 average life 6.42 years Decrease of 1 year (59 ) (1 ) (1 ) (44 ) (8 ) (4 ) (1 ) Recovery rates 15% Increase of 10% (30 ) (4 ) (10 ) (12 ) (2 ) (2 ) Decrease of 10% 27 1 4 14 4 4 Diversity score(a) 12 Increase of 5 (5 ) Decrease of 5 16 Discount curve(b) N/A Increase of 100bps 19 (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. (b)The discount curve is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. Furthermore, for this input it is not possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points. These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIGFP for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above. Corporate Debt The following table represents the relevant market credit inputs used to estimate the sensitivity for the credit default swap portfolio written on investment grade corporate debt and the estimated increase (decrease) in fair value of derivative liability at December 31, 2011 corresponding to changes in these market credit inputs: Input Used at December 31, 2011 (in millions) Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value of Derivative Liability Credit spreads for all names Effect of an increase by 10 basis points $ 14 Effect of a decrease by 10 basis points $ (14 ) All base correlations Effect of an increase by 1% $ 4 Effect of a decrease by 1% $ (4 ) Assumed recovery rate Effect of an increase by 1% $ (4 ) Effect of a decrease by 1% $ 4 These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIGFP for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above. Other derivatives. Valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs initially are calibrated to the transaction price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by observable market data. AIG 2011 Form 10 K 193  Table of Contents  ITEM 7A.
