ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements in certain circumstances. Certain information included in this Report, the Companys Annual Report to Stockholders and other filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as well as information communicated orally or in writing between the dates of such filings) contains or may contain information that is forward looking, including, without limitation, statements regarding the effect of acquisitions, the Companys future financial performance and the effect of government regulations. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors including, without limitation, national and local economic conditions, the general level of interest rates, terms of governmental regulations that affect the Company and interpretations of those regulations, the competitive environment in which the Company operates, financing risks, including the risk that the Companys cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, real estate risks, including variations of real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for tenants in such markets, acquisition and development risks, including failure of such acquisitions to perform in accordance with projections, and possible environmental liabilities, including costs which may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by the Company. In addition, the Companys continued qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Readers should carefully review the Companys financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in the documents the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion of results of operations is based on net income calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company, however, considers Funds From Operations, less a reserve for capital replacement spending, to be a more meaningful measure of economic performance. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, unless considered impaired. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired, the Company will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate future cash flows, the Company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in the demand for our multifamily properties; competition from other available multifamily property owners and changes in market rental rates. Any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in the Companys assets, including real estate, investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and the retained residual interest in financial assets. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition The Company recognizes interest income earned from its investments in notes receivable based upon whether the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and estimable. The notes receivable were either extended by the Company and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest (par value notes) or were made by predecessors whose positions have been acquired by the Company at a discount and are carried at the acquisition amount using the cost recovery method (discounted notes). 14 Table of Contents Under the cost recovery method, the discounted notes are carried at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable. Based upon closed or pending transactions, market conditions, and improved operations of the obligor, among other things, certain notes and the related discounts are determined to be collectible. Interest income is ultimately collected in cash or through foreclosure of the property securing the note. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying properties could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the notes, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Capitalized Costs The Company capitalizes direct and indirect costs (including interest, real estate taxes and other costs) in connection with the redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, capital enhancement and replacement needs of its owned or controlled properties. Indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of certain redevelopment activities and the costs associated with such activities. As a result, changes in costs and activity may have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations and cash flows. Intangible Assets The Company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. Income Taxes The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, our ability to continue to successfully execute our business plan and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances. Allowance for Loan Losses The Company is required to estimate the collectibility of its notes receivable. Managements judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each borrower. Allowances are based on managements opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio. The allowance for loan loss is established through a provision for loss based on managements evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, managements estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. Significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future due to the changes in the market environment. Legal Contingencies The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The Company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions and the effectiveness of strategies, related to these proceedings. Insurance A portion of the Companys insurance for workers compensation, property casualty, general liability, and vehicle liability is self insured. A third party administrator is used to process all such claims. As a result, the Company accrues for such liabilities based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator each month. The Companys reserves associated with the exposure to these self insured liabilities are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each reporting period. 15 Table of Contents Transfers of Financial Assets Gains and losses from sales of financial assets are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the Company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a replacement of FAS Statement No. 125 and other related pronouncements. The gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained residual interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale. The Company recognizes any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in connection with the sale of financial assets in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Subsequently, changes in the fair value of such interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results. Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2001 to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Effective January 1, 2001, the Company began consolidating its previously unconsolidated subsidiaries (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Prior to this date, the Company had significant influence but did not have control. Accordingly, such investments were accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Companys pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented was included in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated subsidiaries. In order for a meaningful analysis of the financial statements to be made, the revenues and expenses for the unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2000, have been included in the following analysis as though they had been consolidated, and as a result the 2000 amounts are different than the historical information as previously reported. All significant intercompany revenues and expenses have been eliminated. Dollar amounts are in thousands. Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 RENTAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS: Rental and other property revenues $ 1,297,764 $ 1,080,958 Property operating expenses (498,426 ) (441,503 ) Owned property management expense (8,785 ) (14,902 ) Income from property operations 790,553 624,553 INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS: Management fees and other income primarily from affiliates 165,800 166,154 Management and other expenses (119,480 ) (114,840 ) Amortization of intangibles (18,729 ) (12,070 ) Income from investment management business 27,591 39,244 General and administrative expenses (18,530 ) (18,123 ) Consulting fees business process improvement (6,400 ) Provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable (6,646 ) Depreciation of rental property (345,649 ) (301,749 ) Interest expense (315,860 ) (284,008 ) Interest and other income 68,593 70,823 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships (16,662 ) 5,246 Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships (26,889 ) (28,229 ) Operating earnings 150,101 107,757 Distributions to minority interest partners in excess of income (47,701 ) (24,375 ) Gain on disposition of real estate property, net 17,394 26,335 Income before minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership 119,794 109,717 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, common (2,639 ) (3,520 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, preferred (9,803 ) (7,019 ) Net income $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Net income attributable to preferred stockholders $ 90,331 $ 63,183 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 17,021 $ 35,995 16 Table of Contents Net Income The Company recognized net income of $107.3 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net income and net income attributable to common stockholders of $99.2 million and $36.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock. The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail. Consolidated Rental Property Operations Consolidated rental and other property revenues from the Companys owned and controlled properties totaled $1,297.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $1,081.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $216.8 million, or 20.0%. This increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues is a result of the following: The acquisition of properties contributed 61.8% of the increase. These contributing acquisitions include the Oxford properties and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000, and three properties in 2001. The purchase of controlling interests in and the subsequent consolidation of partnerships contributed 29.4% of the increase. These partnerships included 80 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000, and seven properties that were first consolidated in 2001. A 3.6% increase in same store revenues contributed 18.0% of the total increase. See further discussion of same store results under the heading Same Store Property Operating Results. The disposition of 25 consolidated apartment properties in 2001 and 22 consolidated apartment properties occurring after the first quarter of 2000 offset the effect of the above increase by 9.2%. Consolidated property operating expenses from the Companys owned and controlled properties, consisting of on site payroll costs, utilities, contract services, turnover costs, repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance, totaled $498.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $441.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $56.9 million or 12.9%. This increase in consolidated property operating expenses is a result of the following: The acquisition of properties contributed 67.4% of the increase. These contributing acquisitions include the Oxford properties and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000, and three properties in 2001. The purchase of controlling interests in and the subsequent consolidation of partnerships contributed 48.4% of the increase. These contributing partnerships included 80 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000, and seven properties that were first consolidated in 2001. A 4.4% increase in same store expenses contributed 34.1% of the total increase. See further discussion of same store results under the heading Same Store Property Operating Results. The capitalization of $19 million of construction related costs offset the above increase by 33.4%. See further discussion of same store results under the heading Same Store Property Operating Results. The disposition of 25 consolidated apartment properties in 2001 and 22 consolidated apartment properties occurring after the first quarter of 2000 further offset the effect of the above increase by 16.5%. Consolidated owned property management expenses, representing the costs of managing the Companys owned and controlled properties, totaled $8.8 million (net of intercompany eliminations) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $6.1 million or 41.0%. The decrease is the result of increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of property management expenses and the associated income from the investment management business, in accordance with consolidation accounting principles. 17 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated asset and investment management business, which is primarily earned from affiliated unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which the Company is the general partner, was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $11.6 million or 30.0%. This decrease in consolidated investment management business is a result of the following: A decrease of $22 million in management fees and other income due to a reduction in the number of properties managed, including approximately 225 for third parties. A decrease of $6.6 million due to increased amortization of intangibles from additional property and asset management contract intangibles that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Oxford properties. A decrease of $5.6 million due to additional management and other expenses relating to one time, mostly non recurring, losses from health and property casualty insurance claims. A decrease of $2.5 million due to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense. An increase of $10.3 million as the Company earned fees resulting from additional construction supervisory management services in 2001. These fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities. An increase of $9.7 million due to increased capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, capital enhancement and capital replacement activities. An increase of $4.6 million resulting from accounting and other fees earned from the Oxford properties, which were acquired by the Company in September 2000. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 142 eliminates amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires the Company to perform impairment tests at least annually on all goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The requirements of SFAS 142 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002. The Company anticipates that the adoption of the non amortization provision of SFAS 142 will result in an increase in annual net income, net of minority interest, of $6.9 million ($0.09 per diluted share) per year. Consolidated General and Administrative and Other Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses remained consistent, with $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company incurred $6.4 million of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor for the year ended December 31, 2001 in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve its business processes and financial controls. This effort resulted in identifying many initiatives to eliminate work and reduce costs. Three of the main themes were to increase focus on the operation of the conventional properties, strengthen corporate support to field operations and increase focus on the realization of equity values embedded in the Companys portfolio of affordable properties. In 2001, the Company transferred affordable property management to a team separate from conventional property management, and reduced its business of providing property management services to unrelated third parties from 60,669 units at the end of 2000 to 31,520 units by the end of 2001, in order to focus on the operation of conventional properties. The Company has strengthened a number of its corporate functions including purchasing, which has provided for lower costs; marketing, to improve traffic; human resources, to improve the recruitment, training and retention of top performers; financial control, to provide more timely financial information; and information technology systems, which includes the pending installation of an on site property management program. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company provided for an additional allowance of $6.6 million for possible losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable and other contingencies. 18 Table of Contents Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property totaled $345.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $301.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $43.9 million or 14.6%. This increase is a result of the purchase of interests in the Oxford properties, as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 122.7% of the increase; the purchase of controlling interests and the subsequent consolidation of partnerships, which contributed 31.7% of the increase; and depreciable additions to same store properties, contributing 27.3% of the increase. The effect of the foregoing was offset 77.0% by a decrease of $34 million due to a change in estimate of useful lives, as explained in the next paragraph, and 4.7% due to the sale of 25 consolidated apartment properties in 2001 and 22 consolidated apartment properties in 2000. During 2001, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, the Company has changed its estimate of the remaining useful lives for its buildings and improvements. Effective July 1, 2001 for certain assets and October 1, 2001 for the majority of the portfolio, the Company extended useful lives of these assets from a weighted average composite life of 25 years to a weighted average composite life of 30 years. This change increased net income by approximately $31 million, net of minority interest, or $0.42 per diluted share in 2001. The Company believes the change reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice. The Company expects this change in useful lives to increase net income by approximately $65 million in 2002 over 2001. Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, totaled $315.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $284.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $31.9 million or 11.2%. This increase is a result of the purchase of interests in the Oxford properties, as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 128.3% of the increase and the purchase of controlling interests and the subsequent consolidation of real estate partnerships, which contributed 44.7% of the increase. The effect of the foregoing was offset 14.2% by the sale of 25 consolidated apartment properties in 2001 and 22 consolidated apartment properties in 2000. The foregoing was further offset 58.8% by an $11.4 million decrease in the interest expense on the Companys line of credit, as the Company had lower average balances outstanding during the year, and the cost of such borrowing was at a weighted average interest rate of 6.64% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 8.95% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income decreased $2.2 million or 3% from $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $68.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was the result of the following: Accretion of discounted notes decreased $16.5 million from $26.4 million, net of allocated expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $9.9 million, net of allocated expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company holds investments in notes receivable which were either extended by the Company and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest (par value notes) or were made by predecessors whose positions have been acquired by the Company at a discount and are carried at the acquisition amount using the cost recovery method (discounted notes). This decrease in accretion was due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed that resulted in accretion. Interest from money market and interest bearing accounts decreased $7.4 million as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately 200 basis points from the prior year, as well as the Company had lower average cash balances ($87.8 million in 2001, compared to $113.8 million in 2000) due to the paydown of certain obligations and distributions to minority interest partners. The above decreases were offset by the gain of $26.1 million recognized from the sale of certain tax exempt bonds acquired in connection with the OTEF merger. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity losses from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to earnings of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $21.9 million. The acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties in 2000 contributed $2.1 million to the earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. However, this was offset by the purchase of additional partnership interests 19 Table of Contents which resulted in the related properties being consolidated and contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses (seven properties in 2001 and 80 properties in 2000). Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $1.3 million. The decrease is a result of the Companys purchase of additional interests in real estate partnerships, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation. Distributions to Minority Interest Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority interest partners in excess of income increased $23.3 million from $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. When partnerships consolidated in the Companys financial statements make cash distributions in excess of income, generally accepted accounting principles require the Company, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over net income, even though there is no economic impact, cost or risk to the Company. The increase for the year occurred due to increased refinancing and operating activity, resulting in an increased amount of cash distributions to minority interest partners. Gain on Disposition of Real Estate Property Gain on disposition of real estate property totaled $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $8.9 million. The sales in both periods are of properties that are considered by management to be inconsistent with the Companys long term investment strategy. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2000 to the Year Ended December 31, 1999 The following comparisons are based on actual historical results for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the year ended December 31, 1999, as the subsidiaries that were consolidated effective January 1, 2001, were accounted for as unconsolidated subsidiaries in both 2000 and 1999. Net Income The Company recognized net income of $99.2 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $36.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to net income and net income attributable to common stockholders of $77.5 million and $24.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock. The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail. Consolidated Rental Property Operations The increases in consolidated rental property operations resulted from improved same store sales results, acquisitions of properties in 2000 and 1999, and the purchase of limited partnership interests from unaffiliated third parties, which gave the Company a controlling interest in partnerships owning 201 properties in 2000. Consolidated rental and other property revenues from the Companys owned and controlled properties totaled $1,051.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $533.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $517.1 million, or 96.9%. Of the $517.1 million increase, 92.4% was related to the purchase of controlling interests in limited partnerships owning 201 properties, which resulted in these properties being consolidated during 2000, 4.9% was due to improved same store sales and the remaining 2.7% was due to acquisitions of properties in 2000 and 1999. Consolidated property operating expenses totaled $426.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $213.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $212.4 million, or 99.3%. The purchase of controlling interests in limited partnerships owning 201 properties, which resulted in these properties being consolidated during 2000, contributed 89.0% of the increase; 3.6% was due to same store sales increases and the remaining 7.4% was due to acquisitions of properties in 2000 and 1999. Property operating expenses consist of on site payroll costs, utilities (net of reimbursements received from tenants), contract services, turnover costs, 20 Table of Contents repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance. The Company believes that energy costs will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Consolidated owned property management expenses, representing the costs of managing the Companys owned or controlled properties, totaled $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $12.0 million. The increase was due to the purchase of controlling interests in limited partnerships owning 201 properties, which resulted in these properties being consolidated in 2000. Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated investment management business was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $6.6 million or 71.7%. Before the non cash charge for the amortization of intangibles, the income from the consolidated investment management business was comparable to the prior year. The decrease in the amortization of intangibles of $7.6 million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully amortized in 1999. Consolidated General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses totaled $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $2.9 million, or 19.1%. The increase is due to additional professional fees incurred to support information technology enhancements and operational initiatives. Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property totaled $298.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with $131.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $167.1 million. This increase is a result of the purchase of interests in the Oxford properties, as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 18% of the increase; and the purchase of controlling interests and the subsequent consolidation of partnerships, which contributed 82% of the increase. Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred finance costs, totaled $269.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $129.7 million or 92.6%. Of the $129.7 million increase, 46.3% was due to the Company acquiring controlling interests in partnerships owning 201 properties and the subsequent consolidation of these properties. Interest expense incurred in connection with the 2000 and 1999 acquisitions (including the Oxford acquisition) contributed 47.6% of the increase. The remaining 6.1% was due to increased usage of the Companys credit facility. Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income totaled $66.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $10.9 million or 19.7%. The $66.2 million of interest income in 2000 consisted of recurring interest income of $39.8 million and accretion of loan discounts of $26.4 million. In 1999, the $55.3 million of interest income consisted of recurring interest income of $22.9 million and accretion of loan discounts of $32.4 million. Recurring interest income increased $16.9 million as a result of the following: during 2000, (i) the Company increased notes receivable from general partner loans by approximately $81.7 million, (ii) as a result of improved property operations certain of the outstanding notes receivable in the form of general partner loans remitted cash payments on a recurring basis. The combination of these factors resulted in $10.7 million of the increase in recurring interest income. The remaining recurring interest income increase of $6.2 million resulted from higher average cash balances maintained in money market and interest bearing accounts during 2000. The Company holds investments in notes receivable which were either extended by the Company and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest (par value notes) or were made by predecessors whose positions have been acquired by the Company at a discount and are carried at the acquisition amount using the cost recovery method (discounted notes). The decrease in accretion of $6.0 million is due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed that resulted in accretion. 21 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to a loss of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $12.1 million. Of the $12.1 million increase, $2.1 million was due to acquisition of interests in Oxford properties and the remaining was due to the acquisition of equity interests in better performing multi family apartment properties where the Company owns a general partnership interest. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Equity losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries totaled $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, a decrease of $2.7 million or 54.0%. The decrease in the equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries is due to interest income earned on general partner notes acquired in 2000 through the acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $3.0 million. The increase is due to the consolidation of 201 additional properties in 2000, as compared to the consolidation of 125 additional properties in 1999. Distributions to Minority Interest Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority interest partners in excess of income was $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. There were no distributions to minority interest partners in excess of income for the year ended December 31, 1999. When partnerships consolidated in the Companys financial statements make cash distributions in excess of income, generally accepted accounting principles require the Company, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over net income, even though there is no economic impact, cost or risk to the Company. The increase for the year occurred due to increased refinancing and operating activity, resulting in an increased amount of cash distributions to minority interest partners. Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Real Estate Property Gain (loss) on disposition of real estate property totaled $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to a gain (loss) of ($1.8) million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $28.1 million. The sales in both periods are of properties that are considered by management to be inconsistent with the Companys long term investment strategy. Same Store Property Operating Results The Company defines same store properties as conventional apartment communities in which AIMCOs ownership interest exceeded 10% in the comparable periods of 2001 and 2000. Total portfolio includes same store properties plus acquisition and redevelopment properties. The following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations in 2001 and 2000, on a same store and a total portfolio basis (dollars in thousands): Same Store Total Portfolio 2001 2000 2001 2000 Properties 641 641 680 680 Apartment units 175,658 175,658 188,338 188,338 Average physical occupancy 93.6 % 94.3 % 92.0 % 91.5 % Average rent collected/occupied unit/month $ 689 $ 667 $ 692 $ 669 Revenues $ 1,109,564 $ 1,071,395 $ 1,192,043 $ 1,129,758 Expenses 426,211 408,199 465,013 436,037 Net operating income $ 683,353 $ 663,196 $ 727,030 $ 693,721 22 Table of Contents Same store net operating income increased $20 million from the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 2001. The 3.3% increase in average rent per occupied unit, from $667 in 2000, to $689 in 2001 contributed $35 million to this increase. Additionally, other income, primarily utility reimbursement, telephone and cable television commission, and resident fees for late payments and the like, contributed $10 million. These increases were offset by a 0.7% decrease in average occupancy year over year, which resulted in an $8 million decrease in same store net operating income, an increase in bad debt expense of $3 million, and increases in property expenses including utilities, property taxes and insurance costs of $6 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively. Same store expenses above for 2001 and 2000 are presented before capitalization of construction related costs. In 2002, same store occupancy levels are expected to remain consistent with 2001 at approximately 92% to 94%. With a focus on a continued increase of its utility reimbursement programs, the Company expects same store revenue growth of 1% to 2%. Operating expense controls remain in place throughout the Company. The Company anticipates same store expense increases of 1% to 3% for 2002, with rising insurance costs being a primary contributor. Overall, the Company expects same store net operating income growth of 0% to 2.5%. The Company has not factored in any changes in the economy that would either positively or negatively impact same store results. 23 Table of Contents Funds From Operations The Company measures its economic profitability based on Funds From Operations (FFO), less a reserve for capital replacement spending. The Companys management believes that FFO, less such a reserve, provides investors with an understanding of the Companys ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable real estate property, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for minority interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership, plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority interest partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. The Company calculates FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to FFO. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of the Companys performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Companys basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Companys FFO is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Net Income $ 107,352 $ 99,178 $ 77,527 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation, net of minority interests 333,049 277,734 121,689 Real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities 57,506 59,360 104,764 Distribution to minority interest partners in excess of income 47,701 24,375 Amortization of intangibles 18,729 12,068 36,731 Income tax arising from disposition of real estate property 3,202 Gain on disposition of real estate property (17,394 ) (26,335 ) 1,785 Gain on disposition of land 3,843 Other items: Deferred income tax benefit 154 1,763 Interest expenses on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 1,568 8,869 4,858 Preferred stock dividends and distributions (35,747 ) (26,112 ) (33,943 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership 12,442 10,539 6,185 Diluted Funds From Operations available to common shares, common share equivalents and common OP Units $ 532,251 $ 439,830 $ 321,359 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and common OP Units outstanding: Common share and common share equivalents 73,648 69,063 63,446 Preferred stock, preferred OP Units, and other securities convertible into common stock 17,187 14,209 8,914 Common OP Units 11,312 8,234 6,313 102,147 91,506 78,673 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 494,457 $ 400,364 $ 253,257 Cash flow used in investing activities (132,010 ) (546,981 ) (281,106 ) Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities (439,562 ) 202,128 58,148 Contribution to Free Cash Flow The Company looks at its Free Cash Flow as a means of monitoring the operations of the components of the Companys business. In this regard, in addition to the year to year comparative discussion, the Company has provided disclosure (see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements) on the contribution (separated between consolidated and unconsolidated activity) to the Companys Free Cash Flow from several components of the Companys business, and a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to FFO, less a reserve for capital replacements, and to 24 Table of Contents net income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as FFO, less a reserve for capital replacements, plus interest expense and preferred stock dividends. The following table summarizes the contributions to the Companys Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Real estate $ 738,309 90 % $ 598,826 86 % $ 435,724 84 % Investment management business: Property and asset management 36,604 5 % 40,954 6 % 38,727 7 % Activity based fees 9,716 1 % 7,438 1 % 4,485 1 % Interest income: recurring 35,180 4 % 42,274 6 % 24,428 5 % Interest income: transactional 33,413 4 % 26,409 4 % 32,460 6 % General and administrative and other expenses (31,576 ) (4 %) (18,123 ) (3 %) (15,248 ) (3 %) Total Free Cash Flow $ 821,646 100 % $ 697,778 100 % $ 520,576 100 % Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2001 to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $821.6 million and $697.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $123.8 million or 17.7%. The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $738.3 million and $598.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $139.5 million or 23.3%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 90% in 2001 from 86% in 2000. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and limited partnership acquisitions (2%). The property and asset management income within the investment management business contributed $36.6 million (5%) and $41.0 million (6%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decrease is primarily a result of (a) a reduction in management fees and other income earned due to a decrease in the number of properties managed, including third parties, (b) an increase in amortization of intangibles due to additional property and asset management contract intangibles that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Oxford properties, (c) an increase in one time losses from health and property casualty insurance claims and (d) a reduction due to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense. These decreases in Free Cash Flow were partially offset by increases in Free Cash Flow as a result of (a) an increase resulting from additional fees due to the acquisition of the Oxford properties in September 2000, (b) an increase in property and asset management income as the Company earned additional construction supervisory management services in 2001 and (c) an increase in the capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, capital enhancement and capital replacement activities. Activity based fees contributed $9.7 million (1%) and $7.4 million (1%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership refinancing, sales and other transactions. The increase in fee income is due to increased refinancing fees of $6.3 million in 2001, compared to $4.0 million in 2000. Recurring interest income decreased $7.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts. The Company had $80.0 million in cash as of December 31, 2001, compared to $157.1 million at December 31, 2000 due to the paydown of certain obligations such as the term loan and revolving credit facility, and interest rates on deposit accounts having decreased approximately 200 basis points. The transactional related interest income contribution was $33.4 million (4%) and $26.4 million (4%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2001 and 2000, an increase of $7 million. Transactional interest income was comprised of gain on sale of bonds and accretion of discounted notes. The Company holds investments in notes receivable which were either extended by the Company and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest (par value notes) or were made by predecessors whose positions have been acquired by the Company at a discount and are carried at the acquisition amount using the cost recovery method (discounted notes). Accretion decreased $16.5 million from 2000 due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed. However this was offset by the gain recognized from the sale of certain tax exempt bonds. General and administrative and other expenses were $31.6 million and $18.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. As discussed previously, the increase in general and administrative and other expenses primarily results from the $6.4 million of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor and an allowance of $6.6 million for possible losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable and other contingencies. 25 Table of Contents Contributions to conventional real estate Free Cash Flow for 2001, 2000 and 1999 before adjustment for minority interest were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Average monthly rent greater than $1,000 per unit $ 94,313 13 % $ 54,922 9 % $ 27,905 7 % Average monthly rent $900 to $1,000 per unit 78,540 10 % 28,729 5 % 14,300 4 % Average monthly rent $800 to $900 per unit 96,351 13 % 62,613 10 % 39,267 10 % Average monthly rent $700 to $800 per unit 110,018 15 % 72,533 12 % 59,587 15 % Average monthly rent $600 to $700 per unit 186,288 25 % 165,512 27 % 89,293 22 % Average monthly rent $500 to $600 per unit 143,208 19 % 163,196 27 % 114,719 28 % Average monthly rent below $500 per unit 42,567 5 % 61,629 10 % 58,348 14 % Total conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow before adjustment for minority interest $ 751,285 100 % $ 609,134 100 % $ 403,419 100 % The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $751.3 million and $609.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $142.2 million or 23.3%. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and limited partnership acquisitions (2%). The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $900 per unit to 23% from 14% in 2000, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $600 per unit to 24% from 37% in 2000. The changes were due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions, limited partnership acquisitions and dispositions. Note 24 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. The Company believes this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2000 to the Year Ended December 31, 1999 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $697.8 million and $520.6 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $177.2 million or 34.0%. The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $598.8 million and $435.7 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $163.1 million or 37.4%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 86% in 2000 from 84% in 1999. The increase was due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions and limited partnership acquisitions. The property and asset management income within the investment management business remained consistent, with $41.0 million and $38.7 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Activity based fees contributed $7.4 million (1%) and $4.5 million (1%) to Free Cash Flow in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership sales, refinancing and other transactions. The increase in fee income is due to increased disposition fees received from the sale of 79 properties in 2000, compared to the fees received from the sale of 63 properties in 1999. The income received from refinancing fees also increased to $4.0 million in 2000, compared to $0.6 million in 1999. Recurring interest income increased $17.8 million as a result of the following: during 2000, (i) the Company increased notes receivable from general partner loans by approximately $81.7 million, (ii) as a result of improved property operations certain of the outstanding notes receivable in the form of general partner loans remitted cash payments on a recurring basis. The combination of these factors resulted in $10.7 million of the increase in recurring interest income. The remaining consolidated recurring interest income increase of $6.2 million resulted from higher average cash balances maintained in money market and interest bearing accounts during 2000. The decrease in accretion of $6.0 million is due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed. Transactional related interest income was $26.4 million (4%) and $32.5 million (6%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2000 and 1999. The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $609.1 million and $403.4 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $205.7 million or 51.0%. The increase was due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions and limited partnership acquisitions. 26 Table of Contents The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $800 per unit to 24% from 21% in 1999, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $500 per unit to 10% from 14% in 1999. The changes were due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions, limited partnership acquisitions and dispositions. Note 24 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. The Company believes this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources 2001 2000 1999 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 494,457 $ 400,364 $ 253,257 Cash flow used in investing activities (132,010 ) (546,981 ) (281,106 ) Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities (439,562 ) 202,128 58,148 At December 31, 2001, the Company had $80.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $138.2 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and impounds held by lenders for capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The Companys principal demands for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital improvements, acquisitions of and investments in properties, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to limited partners. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet short term liquidity demands. In the event that there is an economic downturn and the cash provided by operating activities is no longer adequate, the Company has additional means, such as short term borrowing availability, to be able to meet its short term liquidity demands. On March 11, 2002, the Company amended and restated its revolving credit facility. The commitment remains $400 million, and the number of lender participants in the facilitys syndicate is ten. The obligations under the amended and restated credit facility are secured by a first priority pledge of certain non real estate assets of the Company and a second priority pledge of the equity ownership of the Company and certain subsidiaries of AIMCO. Borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility are available for general corporate purposes. The amended and restated credit facility matures in July 2004 and can be extended once at AIMCOs option, for a term of one year. The annual interest rate under the credit facility is based either on LIBOR or a base rate which is the higher of Bank of America, N.A.s reference rate of 0.5% over the federal funds rate, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. From March 11, 2002 through the later of July 31, 2002 or the date on which the Casden Loan (described below) is paid in full, the margin ranges between 2.05% and 2.55%, in the case of LIBOR based loans, and between 0.55% and 1.05%, in the case of base rate loans, based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio. Commencing on the later of August 1, 2002 or the day after the date on which the Casden Loan is paid in full through maturity, the margin will range between 1.60% and 2.35%, in the case of LIBOR based loans, and between 0.20% and 0.95%, in the case of base rate loans, based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate at March 15, 2002 was 4.42%, and the balance outstanding was $244 million. The amount available under the amended and restated credit facility at March 15, 2002 was $156 million (less $5.0 million for outstanding letters of credit). In connection with the Casden Merger, the Company borrowed $287 million from Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. and several other lenders, pursuant to a term loan (the Casden Loan) to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs. The primary borrowers under the Casden Loan are the Company and the AIMCO Operating Partnership, and all obligations thereunder are guaranteed by certain of AIMCOs subsidiaries and a second priority pledge of certain non real estate assets of the Company. The annual interest rate under the Casden Loan is based either on LIBOR or a base rate which is the higher of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.s reference rate or 0.5% over the federal funds rate, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. The margin is 3.0% in the case of LIBOR based loans and 2.0% in the case of base rate loans, but the margin may increase to 3.25% in the case of LIBOR based loans and 2.25% in the case of base rate loans if the rating of the Companys or the AIMCO Operating Partnerships senior unsecured debt is down graded, the Companys or the AIMCO Operating Partnerships corporate credit rating is downgraded or the rating, if any, of the Casden Loan is downgraded. The Casden Loan matures in March 2004 and can be extended once at AIMCOs option, for a term of one year. The financial covenants contained in the Casden Loan require the AIMCO Operating Partnership to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than 0.55 to 1.0, and an interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0, and a fixed charge 27 Table of Contents coverage ratio of at least 1.70 to 1.0. In addition, the Casden Loan limits AIMCO from distributing more than 80% of its Funds From Operations (as defined in the Casden Loan terms) (or such amounts as may be necessary for AIMCO to maintain its status as a REIT). The Casden Loan imposes minimum net worth requirements and provides other financial covenants related to certain of AIMCOs assets and obligations. These borrowings are expected to be repaid with internal operating cash flow and proceeds from property sales. In order to pay the cash portion of the purchase price and transaction costs related to the acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties, the Company borrowed $302 million from Bank of America, N.A., Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. and several other lenders, pursuant to a term loan on September 20, 2000. In March 2001, the Company paid off the remaining balance of the term loan and charged to operations approximately $2.2 million for the complete amortization of deferred financing and loan origination costs related to the term loan. The total outstanding under the term loan at December 31, 2000 was $137 million of which $74 million was classified as secured short term financing of the Company and the remainder was a liability of the unconsolidated subsidiaries and, therefore, was included in investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2001, in connection with the REIT Modernization Act, the remaining liability of $63 million held at a subsidiary was consolidated. As of December 31, 2001, substantially all of the Companys owned or controlled properties and 81.7% of its total assets were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had total secured outstanding indebtedness of $4,760.8 million, comprised of $3,454.7 million of secured long term financing, $1,092.6 million of secured tax exempt long term bond financing and $213.5 million in secured short term financing. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 19% of the Companys indebtedness bears interest at variable rates of which $679.6 million, or 14%, is tax exempt bond financing. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had 46 loans, each of which is secured by a property and also cross collateralized with certain other loans. The aggregate principal balances outstanding on 46 loans that were cross collateralized are $371.6 million as of December 31, 2001. Other than these loans, none of the Companys debt is subject to cross collateralization provisions. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys long term secured notes payable and tax exempt bonds was 6.96%, with a weighted average maturity of 15 years as of December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company issued $906 million of primarily long term, fixed rate, fully amortizing non recourse mortgage notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%. Each of the notes is individually secured by one of 91 properties with no cross collateralization. The Companys share of proceeds was $620 million, which was used to pay existing mortgage debt and transaction costs of $454 million, with the net proceeds of $166 million used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes. In 2001, the Company incurred $6.6 million in prepayment costs associated with debt refinancing, which was charged to expense. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company also assumed $61.7 million of primarily long term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 7.2% in connection with the acquisition of properties. Each of the notes is individually secured by one of five properties with no cross collateralization. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company issued $186.8 million of preferred stock in two underwritten public offerings yielding $179.7 million of net proceeds. In addition, the Company issued $100 million of preferred stock in connection with the OTEF merger. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these preferred stocks. In addition, the Company issued $106.3 million of Class A Common Stock in connection with the OTEF merger, and $79.9 million of OP Units in connection with limited partnership and other acquisitions. 28 Table of Contents The Company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements, such as refinancing debt and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units) and cash generated from operations. On November 7, 2001, AIMCO and the AIMCO Operating Partnership filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to an aggregate of $822 million of debt and equity securities of AIMCO and $500 million of debt securities of the AIMCO Operating Partnership, all of which was carried forward from AIMCOs 1998 shelf registration statement. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 9, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $822 million available and the AIMCO Operating Partnership had $500 million available from this registration statement. The Company expects to finance acquisitions of real estate interests with the issuance of equity and debt securities under the shelf registration statement as well as cash from operations or short term borrowings. Capital Expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company spent a total of $320 million for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures include capital replacements (expenditures required to maintain the related asset), initial capital expenditures (ICE, expenditures at a property that have been identified, at the time the property is acquired, as expenditures to be incurred within one year of the acquisition), enhancements (expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property) and redevelopment (expenditures that substantially upgrade the related property). The Companys share of those expenditures are as follows (in millions): Conventional Assets Affordable Assets Total Capital replacements $ 52.9 $ 6.1 $ 59.0 ICE 58.5 58.5 Enhancements 28.2 3.5 31.7 Redevelopment 170.8 170.8 Total $ 310.4 $ 9.6 $ 320.0 Included in these capital expenditures are the capitalization of approximately $42 million of direct and indirect costs related to these activities. These expenditures were funded by net cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under the Companys credit facility. During 2001, the Company commissioned a project to study process improvement ideas to reduce operating costs of the Company. The result of the study led to a re engineering of Company business processes and eventual redeployment of its personnel and related capital spending. The implementation of these plans resulted in a refinement of the Companys process for capitalizing certain direct and indirect project costs, and increased capitalization of such costs by approximately $31 million in 2001 compared to 2000. In addition, the Company had a significant increase in its backlog of planned capital activities, including affordable redevelopment and kitchen and bath enhancement programs. Accordingly, the increased capitalization of these related costs increased net income by approximately $20 million or $0.27 per diluted share for 2001 (after intercompany eliminations and minority interest). Of that total, approximately $17 million resulted from the refinement of the Companys systems and process for identifying and tracking direct and indirect costs related to those activities. The remainder of approximately $3 million relates to a combination of increased construction and redevelopment activities, a greater number of owned properties and higher cost associated with such activities. Capitalized costs are included in redevelopment, ICE, and capital expenditure spending and reflected in the associated returns from these related assets. 29 Table of Contents The Companys accounting treatment of various capital and maintenance costs, which the Company believes is comparable to prevailing industry standards, is detailed in the following table: Depreciable Life Expenditure Accounting Treatment in Years Initial capital expenditures capitalize 5 to 15 Capital enhancements capitalize 5 to 30 Capital replacements: Carpet/vinyl replacement capitalize 5 Carpet cleaning expense N/A Major appliance replacement (refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, washers/dryers) capitalize 5 Cabinet replacement capitalize 5 Major new landscaping capitalize 5 Seasonal plantings and landscape replacements expense N/A Roof replacements capitalize 15 Roof repairs expense N/A Model furniture capitalize 5 Office equipment capitalize 5 Exterior painting, significant capitalize 5 Interior painting expense N/A Parking lot repairs expense N/A Parking lot repaving capitalize 15 Equipment repairs expense N/A General policy for capitalization capitalize amounts Various in excess of $250 Return on Assets and Return on Equity The Companys Return On Assets and Return On Equity for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are as follows: Based on AFFO Based on FFO Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Return on Assets(a) 9.3 % 9.8 % 9.2 % 9.9 % 10.3 % 9.7 % Return on Equity Basic(b) 13.7 % 14.7 % 14.5 % 15.0 % 15.8 % 15.6 % Diluted(c) 12.8 % 13.3 % 12.9 % 13.9 % 14.5 % 13.9 % (a) The Company defines Return on Assets (AFFO) as (i) annualized Free Cash Flow, divided by (ii) Average Assets. Average Assets are computed by averaging the sum of Assets, as defined below, at the beginning and the end of the period. Assets are total assets, plus accumulated depreciation, less accumulated capital replacements of $162.7 million, $103.6 million and $63.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and less all non indebtedness liabilities. The Company defines Return on Assets (FFO) as (i) annualized Free Cash Flow plus capital replacements, divided by (ii) Average Assets plus accumulated capital replacements. Total assets include all of the assets of the Company, including conventional properties, affordable properties and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. (b) The Company defines Return on Equity Basic (AFFO) as (i) annualized AFFO Basic, divided by (ii) Average Equity. Average Equity is computed by averaging the sum of Equity, as defined below, at the beginning and the end of the period. Equity is total stockholders equity, plus accumulated depreciation, less accumulated capital replacements of $162.7 million, $103.6 million and $63.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, less preferred stock, plus minority interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership, net of preferred OP Unit interests ($158.1 million, $132.0 million and $72.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively). The Company defines Return on Equity Basic (FFO) as (i) annualized AFFO Basic plus capital replacements; divided by (ii) Average Equity plus accumulated capital replacements. (c) The Company defines Return on Equity Diluted (AFFO) and Return on Equity Diluted (FFO) assuming conversion of debt and preferred securities whose conversion is dilutive. 30 Table of Contents Return on Assets based on AFFO and FFO in 2001 decreased from 2000 by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, primarily as a result of (i) the consolidation of the taxable REIT subsidiaries, which were previously unconsolidated; and (ii) the consolidation of additional real estate partnerships, resulting in 100% of the partnerships assets being included, but only AIMCOs ownership share of the return is included. Return on Equity based on AFFO and FFO in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to the decline in Return on Assets, as magnified by increased financial leverage. Contingencies Environmental Various federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances present on a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of the hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, hazardous substances may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and our ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by governmental agencies, the presence of hazardous wastes on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of our properties, the Company could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with its properties or properties it acquires or manages in the future. Inflation Substantially all of the leases at the Companys apartment properties are for a period of twelve months or less, allowing, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rental rate and the opportunity to re lease the apartment unit at the prevailing market rate. The short term nature of these leases generally serves to minimize the risk to the Company of the adverse effect of inflation and the Company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on its operations. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. The Company is not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. The Company uses predominantly long term, fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding or repricing risks of short term borrowings. The Company uses short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund acquisitions and generally expects to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds or long term debt financings. The Company had $925.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2001, which represents 19% of the Companys total outstanding debt. Of the total variable debt, $679.6 million was floating tax exempt bond financing, $32.0 million was floating secured notes, and the remaining $213.5 million was the amount outstanding on the credit facility. Variable rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap Index (the "BMA Index"), which had yields ranging from 1.61% to 2.98% in the year ended December 31, 2001. Since 1981, BMA Index has averaged 56.2% of the 10 year Treasury Yield. Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in the Companys income and cash flows being reduced by $9.3 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $3,835.7 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2001, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for the Companys consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds are as follows (dollars in thousands): Amortization Maturities Total Percentage 2002 $ 98,041 $ 134,106 $ 232,147 5.1 % 2003 101,495 220,780 322,275 7.1 % 2004 108,226 49,915 158,141 3.5 % 2005 115,274 130,944 246,218 5.4 % 2006 119,282 199,401 318,683 7.0 % Thereafter 3,269,878 71.9 % $ 4,547,342 100.0 % The estimated aggregate fair value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short term secured debt as of December 31, 2001 approximates their carrying value due to their relatively short term nature. Management further believes that the fair value of the Companys variable rate secured tax exempt bond debt and variable rate secured long term debt approximate their carrying values. The fair value for the Companys fixed rate debt agreements was estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues. The carrying amount of the Companys fixed rate debt at December 31, 2001 was $3.8 billion compared to the computed fair value of $4.3 billion (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
