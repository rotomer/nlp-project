ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The following discussion of results of operations is based on net income calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to net income, we measure our economic profitability based on Funds From Operations, or FFO, less Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending, which we refer to as Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO. See the discussion of FFO and AFFO as supplemental measurements under the heading "Funds From Operations" in this Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, unless considered impaired. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired, we will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; and changes in market rental rates. Any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition We generally recognize interest income earned from our investments in notes receivable when the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and estimable. The notes receivable were either extended by us and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest ("par value notes") or were made by predecessors whose positions we acquired usually at a discount ("discounted notes"). We continue to assess the collectibility or impairment of each note on a periodic basis. Under the cost recovery method, we carry the discounted notes at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable. Based upon closed or pending transactions (which include sales, refinancing, foreclosures and rights offerings), we have determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, we are recognizing accretion income, on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. If we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have decreased by $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on the ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income in future periods could vary and could result in lower accretion income than in prior periods. 21 Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable In estimating the collectibility of notes receivable, managements judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each borrower. Allowances are based on managements opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio. The allowance for losses on notes receivable is established through a provision for loss based on managements evaluation of the risk inherent in the notes receivable portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, specific impaired notes receivable and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, which includes a review of notes receivable on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loss experience, managements estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on notes receivable. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we identified and recorded $9.0 million and no losses on notes receivable, respectively. We will continue to monitor and assess these notes and changes in required reserves may occur in the future due to changes in the market environment. Capitalized Costs We capitalize direct and indirect costs (including salaries, interest, real estate taxes and other costs) incurred in connection with redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities. Indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. The amounts capitalized depend on the volume, timing and costs of such activities. As a result, changes in costs and activities may have a significant effect on our results of operations and cash flows if the costs being capitalized are not proportionately increased or reduced, as the case may be. Based on the level of capital spending during 2002, if capital activities had decreased during the year by 10%, we could have had additional operating expenses of between $2.5 million and $5.9 million. Additionally, if capital activities had increased during the year by 10%, we could have had lower operating expenses of between $2.5 million and $5.9 million. See further discussion under the heading "Capital Expenditures." Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2002 to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net Income We recognized net income of $169.0 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $75.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to net income of $107.4 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock for that period. The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail. Consolidated Rental Property Operations Rental and other property revenues from our consolidated properties totaled $1,405.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $1,224.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $181.0 million, or 14.8%. This increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues was principally a result of the following: $148.7 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of operations of the properties acquired through the Casden Merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002; $70.2 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002; 22 $14.1 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations); and $8.6 million of an offsetting decrease related to a 0.70% decrease in same store revenues. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results." Property operating expenses for our consolidated properties, consisting of on site payroll costs, utilities (net of reimbursements received from residents), contract services, property management fees, turnover costs, repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance, totaled $561.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $465.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $95.7 million or 20.5%. This increase in property operating expenses was principally a result of the following: $58.8 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of operations of properties acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002; $36.4 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002; $4.3 million of the increase related to a 0.90% increase in same store operating expense. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results;" $3.1 million of the increase was related to properties in the redevelopment portfolio becoming ready for their intended use, and as a result certain operating expenses are no longer being capitalized; and $8.8 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations). Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated investment management business, which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships, for which we are the general partner, was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $9.3 million or 33.7%. This decrease in income from the consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following: $13.2 million of the decrease related to reduced fees billed for construction supervisory management services in 2002. These fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities. In addition, lower costs were incurred and therefore lower billings occurred as a result of the ongoing management initiative to contain costs; $7.3 million of the decrease related to an increase in insurance costs in the property hazard program. These increased costs were the result of historical claim losses from prior years; $5.5 million of the decrease related to increased ownership in and number of consolidated real estate partnerships, which results in an additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property operating expense; $4.5 million of the decrease related to a net reduction in fees including: $6.9 million decrease in refinancing and disposition fees, due to decreased refinancing transactions (28 in 2002 compared to 59 in 2001) resulting in lower fees earned; and $7.7 million decrease in fees earned for services provided to third parties due to a planned reduction in third party asset management. This decrease was offset by a $10.1 million increase in asset management and developer fees related to the NAPICO acquisition in 2002; $2.5 million of the decrease related to additional depreciation expense related primarily to the new site solutions hardware and software purchases in late 2001 and early 2002; $14.7 million of an offsetting increase related to the reduced amortization of intangibles, of which $6.8 million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully 23 amortized in 2001, and $7.9 million was attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"); and $9.3 million of an offsetting increase related to lower compensation and health insurance expense resulting from a change in plan administrator and a reduction in work force, in part due to planned reduction in third party property management and management cost reduction initiatives. Consolidated General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased by $1.8 million from the $18.5 million of such expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was principally a result of increased professional fees, primarily incurred in connection with the evaluation of the loan receivable portfolio. Consolidated Other Expenses Consolidated other expenses were $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2002, these expenses included the following: $3.1 million related to payments in settlement of claims asserted against us, including litigation and arbitration; $2.2 million related to the write off of costs related to potential acquisitions that were not completed; $0.9 million was primarily related to severance and hiring costs, and costs associated with the transition of certain accounting functions from Greenville, South Carolina to our headquarters in Denver, Colorado; and $4.0 million related to personnel costs associated with annual compensation. In 2001, we incurred $6.4 million of other expenses comprised of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls. Consolidated Provision for Losses on Accounts, Fees and Notes Receivable Consolidated provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2002, all $9.0 million related to provision for losses on notes receivable, which provision was determined based on our review in 2002 of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio. We will continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis. In 2001, there was no provision for losses on notes receivable as all $6.6 million related to additional allowance for possible losses on accounts, fees and other contingencies. Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property decreased $38.5 million, or 11.8%, to $288.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was principally a result of the following: $69.0 million of the decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets made in 2001, which was consistent with managements expectations. During 2001, we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings. We believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice. This change in useful lives increased net income by approximately $74.3 million, net of minority interest, in 2002 over 2001, of which a portion was recognized as an increase to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. The recognition of this change in useful lives resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.87 and $0.86, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002; 24 $0.8 million of the decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations); $24.0 million of an offsetting increase related to depreciation of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002; and $13.2 million of an offsetting increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002. Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs together with any prepayment penalties incurred, totaled $339.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $297.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $42.2 million, or 14.2%. The increase was principally a result of the following: $34.8 million of the increase related to interest on additional property debt acquired through three direct purchases in 2001, ten months of interest on additional property debt acquired in the Casden Merger and four months of interest on the debt related to the New England Properties Acquisition in 2002; $17.8 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of 2001, one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of 2002, 27 properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of 2002 and 56 properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2002; $2.3 million of the increase related to increased interest expense on our revolving credit facility and term loan. We had an average balance outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2002 of $500.4 million (including the Casden Loan), and an average balance outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $236.1 million (including the term loan we borrowed for the acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties). The cost of such borrowings was at a weighted average interest rate of 4.43% compared to 7.06%, respectively; $10.9 million of an offsetting decrease related to an overall decrease in variable interest rates of approximately 1.5% from the prior year; and $2.4 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 apartment properties in 2001 (results of 2002 dispositions were included in discontinued operations). Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income increased $5.3 million, or 7.7%, to $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was principally a result of the following: $26.9 million of the increase related to accretion income increasing from $9.9 million, net of allocated expenses of $4.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $36.8 million, net of allocated expenses of $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in accretion income was due to more completed transactions resulting in accretion occurring in 2002 than in 2001; $18.4 million of an offsetting decrease related to a decrease in recognized gain on certain tax exempt bonds that were held in 2001 and sold in the second quarter of 2002; and $3.8 million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest on money market and interest bearing accounts, as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately 1.5% from the prior year, while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent. 25  Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with a loss of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a change of $17.4 million. This change was principally due to the change in estimate of useful lives of the underlying real estate assets completed by us in 2001, which resulted in lower depreciation expense of approximately $16.0 million. See the previous discussion on the change in estimate of useful lives of assets under the heading "Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property." Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $22.5 million. This decrease is primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and a reduction in net income, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation. Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate Loss on dispositions of real estate, primarily by unconsolidated entities, totaled $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to a gain of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a change of $45.3 million. Part of this change was a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of ("SFAS 144") effective January 1, 2002, where we now report assets held for sale (as defined by SFAS 144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. Due to this adoption, for the year ended December 31, 2002, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during 2002. For 2001, however, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with the disposal of all properties sold. The properties sold in both periods, as well as the properties held for sale, were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Gain (loss) on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences. Included in gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate, we recorded a loss of approximately $28.0 million. This $28.0 million loss resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold. The recognition of this amount in the current period is considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties. The recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition to the $28.0 million loss discussed above, we recorded approximately $9.0 million of impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, offset by approximately $9.0 million of net casualty gains. Distributions to Minority Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority partners in excess of income decreased $19.4 million to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income, generally accepted accounting principles require us, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distributions over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position, even though we do not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. This decrease was due to a reduced level of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity, and our increased ownership of such partnerships. Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to income of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a change of $10.3 million. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 144, effective January 1, 2002, we now report assets classified as held for sale (as defined by SFAS 144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002 and the associated gain (loss) on the disposition of the properties. For the year ended December 31, 2001, discontinued operations included the 2001 operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in 2002. There were no gains or 26 losses on assets sold in 2001 included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. The change in discontinued operations was primarily related to a net loss on disposals of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We incurred net losses of $21.0 million from the sale of certain senior living facilities, which we deemed non strategic assets. In addition, approximately $3.0 million of impairment losses were recorded on properties that were classified as held for sale. These losses were partially offset by $15.0 million in net gains on the sale of other discontinued operations properties. The properties sold, as well as the properties classified as held for sale, were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details on discontinued operations. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2001 to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Effective January 1, 2001, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated subsidiaries (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Prior to this date, we had significant influence over, but did not have control of, such subsidiaries. Accordingly, such investments were accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented was included in equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In order for a meaningful analysis of the financial statements to be made, the revenues and expenses for the unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2000, have been included in the following analysis as though they had been consolidated, and as a result the 2000 amounts are different than the historical information as previously reported. All significant intercompany revenues and expenses have been eliminated. Dollar amounts are in thousands. Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 RENTAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS: Rental and other property revenues $ 1,224,667 $ 1,028,510 Property operating expenses (465,721 ) (429,642 ) Income from property operations 758,946 598,868 INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS: Management fees and other income primarily from affiliates 158,367 159,888 Management and other expenses (112,047 ) (108,574 ) Amortization of intangibles (18,729 ) (12,070 ) Income from investment management business 27,591 39,244 General and administrative expenses (18,530 ) (18,123 ) Other expenses (6,400 ) Provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable (6,646 ) Depreciation of rental property (327,070 ) (290,612 ) Interest expense (297,507 ) (274,315 ) Interest and other income 68,417 70,545 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships (16,662 ) 5,246 Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships (37,619 ) (27,451 ) Operating earnings 144,520 103,402 Gain on dispositions of real estate 17,394 26,335 Distributions to minority partners in excess of income (46,359 ) (24,375 ) Income before minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership and discontinued operations 115,555 105,362 Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, preferred (9,803 ) (7,020 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership, common (2,639 ) (3,519 ) Income from continuing operations 103,113 94,823 Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations, net 4,239 4,355 Net income $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Net income attributable to preferred stockholders $ 90,331 $ 63,183 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 17,021 $ 35,995 27 Net Income We recognized net income of $107.4 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net income of $99.2 million, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock for that period. The following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail. Consolidated Rental Property Operations Rental and other property revenues from consolidated properties totaled $1,224.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $1,028.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $196.2 million, or 19.1%. This increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues was principally a result of the following: $130.0 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000; $58.5 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000; $38.2 million of the increase related to a 3.6% increase in same store revenues; and $34.9 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000. Property operating expenses from our consolidated properties, consisting of on site payroll costs, utilities (net of reimbursements received from residents), contract services, property management fees, turnover costs, repairs and maintenance, advertising and marketing, property taxes and insurance, totaled $465.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $429.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $36.1 million or 8.4%. This increase in consolidated property operating expenses was principally a result of the following: $37.8 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000; $25.6 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000; $18.0 million of the increase related to a 4.4% increase in same store expenses; $26.9 million of an offsetting decrease related to the capitalization of construction related costs; and $18.2 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000. Consolidated Investment Management Business Income from the consolidated investment management business, which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships, for which we are the general partner, was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $11.6 million or 29.6%. This decrease in consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following: $22.0 million of the decrease related to the reduction in the number of properties managed, including approximately 225 for third parties; 28 $6.6 million of the decrease related to increased amortization of intangibles from additional property and asset management contract intangibles that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Oxford properties; $5.6 million of the decrease related to losses from health and property casualty insurance claims; $2.5 million of the decrease related to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense; $10.3 million of an offsetting increase related to fees resulting from additional construction supervisory management services in 2001. These fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities; $9.7 million of an offsetting increase related to increased capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities; and $4.6 million of an offsetting increase related to additional accounting and other fees earned from the Oxford properties, which were acquired by us in September 2000. Consolidated General and Administrative and Other Expenses Consolidated general and administrative expenses remained consistent, with $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. We incurred $6.4 million of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor for the year ended December 31, 2001 in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls. This effort resulted in identifying many initiatives to eliminate work and reduce costs. Three of the main themes were to increase focus on the operation of the conventional properties, strengthen corporate support to field operations and increase focus on the realization of equity values embedded in our portfolio of affordable properties. In 2001, we transferred affordable property management to a team separate from conventional property management, and reduced our business of providing property management services to unrelated third parties from 60,669 units at the end of 2000 to 31,520 units by the end of 2001, in order to focus on the operation of conventional properties. We have strengthened a number of our corporate functions including: purchasing, which has provided for lower costs; marketing, to improve traffic; human resources, to improve the recruitment, training and retention of top performers; financial control, to provide more timely financial information; and information technology systems, which includes the pending installation of an on site property management program. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2001, we provided for an additional allowance of $6.6 million for possible losses on accounts, fees and other contingencies. Consolidated Depreciation of Rental Property Consolidated depreciation of rental property totaled $327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $290.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $36.5 million or 12.6%. This increase was principally a result of the following: $51.5 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000; $12.9 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000; $12.0 million of the increase related to depreciable additions to same store properties; $34.0 million of an offsetting decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets. During 2001, we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings. Effective July 1, 2001 for certain 29 assets and October 1, 2001 for the majority of the portfolio, we extended useful lives of these assets from a weighted average composite life of 25 years to a weighted average composite life of 30 years. This change increased net income by approximately $31 million, net of minority interest, or $0.42 per diluted share in 2001. We believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice; and $7.8 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties after the first quarter of 2000. Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, totaled $297.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $274.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $23.2 million or 8.5%. This increase was principally a result of the following: $38.4 million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in 2001 and operations of the properties acquired through the Oxford acquisition and 12 other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2000; $13.2 million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in, and the subsequent consolidation of, real estate partnerships. These real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in 2001 and 79 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2000; $14.1 million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest expense on our line of credit. We had lower average balances outstanding during the year, and the cost of such borrowing was at a weighted average interest rate of 6.64% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 8.95% for the year ended December 31, 2000; $7.3 million of an offsetting decrease related to a reduction in interest expense paid on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities, as approximately 2.4 million and 0.2 million of these securities were converted into Common Stock in late 2000 and in 2001, respectively; and $6.3 million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of 25 properties in 2001 and 22 properties occurring after the first quarter of 2000. Consolidated Interest and Other Income Consolidated interest and other income decreased $2.1 million or 3.0% from $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was principally the result of the following: $16.5 million of the decrease related to a reduction in accretion income of discounted notes from $26.4 million, net of allocated expenses of $4.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $9.9 million, net of allocated expenses of $4.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease in accretion income was due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed that resulted in accretion income. $10.0 million of the decrease related to lower interest from money market and interest bearing accounts as interest rates on deposit accounts had decreased approximately 200 basis points from the prior year, as well as we had lower average cash balances ($87.8 million in 2001, compared to $113.8 million in 2000) due to the paydown of certain obligations and distributions to minority interest partners. $26.1 million of an offsetting increase related to the gain recognized from the sale of certain tax exempt bonds. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in losses from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to earnings of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $21.9 million. The acquisition of interests in the Oxford properties in 2000 contributed $2.1 million to the earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. However, this was offset by the purchase of additional partnership interests 30 which resulted in the related properties being consolidated and contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses (seven properties in 2001 and 80 properties in 2000). Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a change of $10.1 million. The change was primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in real estate partnerships, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation. Distributions to Minority Partners in Excess of Income Distributions to minority partners in excess of income increased $22.0 million from $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income, generally accepted accounting principles require us, as the majority partner, to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position, even though we do not suffer any economic effect, cost or risk. The increase for the year occurred due to increased refinancing and operating activity, resulting in an increased amount of cash distributions to minority interest partners. Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate Gain on dispositions of real estate totaled $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $8.9 million. The sales in both periods are of properties that are considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Gains (losses) on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 144, effective January 1, 2002, we now report assets classified as held for sale (as defined by SFAS 144) and assets sold in the current period, as discontinued operations. This change has resulted in certain reclassifications of 2001 and 2000 financial statement amounts, as all results of operations for those properties sold or classified as held for sale in 2002 must be included in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income for all comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold or classified as held for sale in 2002. There are no gains or losses on assets sold in 2001 or 2000 included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on discontinued operations. 31 Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results We define "same store" properties as conventional apartment properties in which our ownership interest exceeds 10% and operations are stabilized for over one year in the comparable periods of 2002 and 2001. "Total portfolio" includes same store properties plus conventional acquisition and redevelopment properties. The following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations on a "same store" and a "total portfolio" basis (dollars in thousands): Conventional Same Store Conventional Total Portfolio 2002 2001 2002 2001 Properties 620 620 665 636 Apartment units 173,397 173,397 188,966 179,876 Average physical occupancy 92.5 % 93.3 % 91.4 % 92.1 % Average rent collected/unit/month $ 693 $ 694 $ 714 $ 679 Revenues $ 1,130,477 $ 1,138,481 $ 1,242,398 $ 1,172,299 Expenses 420,879 417,254 465,997 436,156 Net operating income $ 709,598 $ 721,227 $ 776,401 $ 736,143 Same store net operating income decreased $11.6 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues decreased $8.0 million, or 0.7%, primarily due to lower average rent (down $1 per unit), lower occupancy (down 0.8%), and increased bad debt; all of which were somewhat offset by an increase in ancillary income. Expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in property taxes as well as increased insurance expense of $1.5 million as the cost of property hazard insurance coverage rose in March 2002. These increases were somewhat offset by reductions in other categories. Same store expenses for both periods presented above are net of capitalized costs. The same store net operating results above represent 88.5% and 92.0% of total Free Cash Flow for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 32 Funds From Operations We believe that FFO and AFFO, when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. These supplemental measures capture real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, disposals of depreciable real estate property, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships and joint ventures and discontinued operations. We calculate FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for minority interest in the AIMCO Operating Partnership, plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. We calculate FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to FFO. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, our FFO is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Net Income $ 169,046 $ 107,352 $ 99,178 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation, net of minority interest 260,507 316,101 256,917 Real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities 33,544 57,506 70,188 Loss (gain) on dispositions of real estate 27,902 (17,394 ) (26,335 ) Distributions to minority partners in excess of income 26,979 46,359 24,375 Amortization of intangibles 4,026 18,729 12,068 Income tax arising from disposals 3,202 Gain on disposition of land 3,843 Discontinued operations: Real estate depreciation, net of minority interest 10,403 16,948 9,997 Loss on disposals, net of minority interest 8,958 Distributions to minority partners in excess of income 1,321 1,342 Income tax arising from disposals 2,507 Other items: Deferred income tax benefit 154 Interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 1,161 1,568 8,869 Preferred stock dividends and distributions (60,272 ) (35,747 ) (26,120 ) Minority interest in AIMCO Operating Partnership 23,908 12,442 10,539 Diluted Funds From Operations available to common shares, and equivalents $ 509,990 $ 532,251 $ 439,830 Weighted average number of common shares and equivalents: Common shares and equivalents 86,773 73,648 69,063 Preferred stock, preferred OP Units, and other securities convertible into common shares 10,847 17,187 15,308 Common OP Units and equivalents 12,395 11,312 7,135 110,015 102,147 91,506 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 497,289 $ 494,457 $ 400,364 Cash flow used in investing activities (786,377 ) (132,010 ) (546,981 ) Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities 308,641 (439,562 ) 202,128 33 Contribution to Free Cash Flow We look at our Free Cash Flow as a means of monitoring the operations of the components of our business. In this regard, in addition to the year to year comparative discussion, we have provided disclosure (see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) on the contribution (separated between consolidated and unconsolidated activity) to our Free Cash Flow from several components of our business, and a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to FFO, less Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, and to net income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. We define Free Cash Flow as FFO, less Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, plus interest expense and preferred stock dividends. The following table summarizes the contributions to our Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Real estate $ 745,864 93 % $ 700,702 89 % $ 575,888 85 % Investment management business: Property and asset management 13,388 2 % 32,538 4 % 40,954 6 % Activity based fees 8,900 1 % 13,782 2 % 7,438 1 % Interest income: recurring 29,155 3 % 32,378 4 % 41,996 6 % Interest income: transactional 44,539 6 % 36,039 5 % 26,409 4 % General and administrative and other expenses and provision for losses (39,550 ) (5 %) (31,576 ) (4 %) (18,123 ) (2 %) Total Free Cash Flow $ 802,296 100 % $ 783,863 100 % $ 674,562 100 % Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2002 to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $802.3 million and $783.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $18.4 million or 2.3%. The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $745.9 million and $700.7 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $45.2 million or 6.5%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 93% in 2002 from 89% in 2001. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions ($88.7 million), offset by a decrease due to increased Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending ($31.8 million), and a decrease in same store operating results ($12.6 million). The property and asset management income within the investment management business contributed $13.4 million (2%) and $32.5 million (4%) to Free Cash Flow in 2002 and 2001, respectively. This decrease is primarily a result of (a) a reduction in fees related to construction supervisory management services, (b) a reduction in management fees and other income earned due to a decrease in the number of properties managed, including third parties, (c) an increase in losses from property casualty insurance claims, and (d) a reduction due to the increased ownership in and number of consolidated real estate partnerships, which results in additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property operating expense. These decreases in Free Cash Flow were partially offset by increases in Free Cash Flow as a result of a decrease in compensation and health insurance expense. Activity based fees contributed $8.9 million (1%) and $13.8 million (2%) to Free Cash Flow in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership refinancing, sales and other transactions. This decrease was primarily due to decreased refinancing transactions resulting in fees (28 in 2002 compared to 59 in 2001). Recurring interest income decreased $3.2 million primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts while general partner loan interest remained consistent. Money market and interest bearing accounts decreased as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately 1.5% from the prior year, while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent. The transactional related interest income contribution was $44.5 million (6%) and $36.0 million (5%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $8.5 million. Transactional interest income was comprised of gain on sale of bonds and accretion income on discounted notes. We hold investments in both par value notes receivable and discounted notes receivable. Accretion income on discounted notes increased $26.9 million from 2001 due to more completed transactions in 2002. Offsetting this increase was a decrease of $18.4 million related to the recognized gain on sale of certain tax exempt bonds that were held in 2001 and sold in the second quarter of 2002. 34  Contributions to conventional real estate Free Cash Flow for 2002, 2001 and 2000 before adjustment for minority interest were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Amount Contr.% Average monthly rent greater than $1,200 per unit $ 86,616 12 % $ 47,943 7 % $ 24,917 4 % Average monthly rent $1,000 to $1,200 per unit 56,602 8 % 46,854 6 % 30,005 5 % Average monthly rent $900 to $1,000 per unit 93,763 12 % 78,737 11 % 28,729 5 % Average monthly rent $800 to $900 per unit 82,076 11 % 95,658 13 % 61,832 10 % Average monthly rent $700 to $800 per unit 102,112 14 % 104,704 14 % 70,857 12 % Average monthly rent $600 to $700 per unit 151,339 20 % 184,496 25 % 156,554 27 % Average monthly rent $500 to $600 per unit 131,429 18 % 137,023 19 % 158,461 27 % Average monthly rent less than $500 per unit 37,084 5 % 37,362 5 % 56,271 10 % Total conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow before adjustment for minority interest $ 741,021 100 % $ 732,777 100 % $ 587,626 100 % The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $741.0 million and $732.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, an increase of $8.2 million or 1.1%. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions ($53.7 million), offset by a decrease due to increased Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending ($26.9 million), a decrease in same store operating results ($12.6 million), and a decrease due to 2001 dispositions ($5.3 million). The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $900 per unit to 32% from 24% in 2001, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $600 per unit to 23% from 24% in 2001. The changes were due to acquisitions offset by decreases in property operations and dispositions. Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. We believe this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2001 to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Free Cash Flow contributed was $783.9 million and $674.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $109.3 million or 16.2%. The real estate Free Cash Flow contribution was $700.7 million and $575.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $124.8 million or 21.7%. Real estate contribution to total Free Cash Flow increased to 89% in 2001 from 85% in 2000. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and limited partnership acquisitions (2%). The property and asset management income within the investment management business contributed $32.5 million (4%) and $41.0 million (6%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decrease is primarily a result of (a) a reduction in management fees and other income earned due to a decrease in the number of properties managed, including third parties, (b) an increase in losses from health and property casualty insurance claims and (c) a reduction due to the increased ownership in controlled, consolidated partnerships, which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense. These decreases in Free Cash Flow were partially offset by increases in Free Cash Flow as a result of (a) an increase in property and asset management income resulting from additional fees due to the acquisition of the Oxford properties in September 2000, (b) an increase in property and asset management income as we earned additional construction supervisory management services in 2001 and (c) an increase in the capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction, redevelopment, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities. Activity based fees contributed $13.8 million (2%) and $7.4 million (1%) to Free Cash Flow in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Activity based fees are earned on partnership refinancing, sales and other transactions. The increase in fee income is due to increased refinancing fees of $10.4 million in 2001, compared to $4.0 million in 2000. Recurring interest income decreased $9.6 million primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts. We had $80.0 million in cash as of December 31, 2001, compared to $157.1 million at December 31, 2000 due to the paydown of certain obligations such as the term loan and revolving 35 credit facility, and interest rates on deposit accounts having decreased approximately 200 basis points. The transactional related interest income contribution was $36.0 million (5%) and $26.4 million (4%) of Free Cash Flow contribution in 2001 and 2000, an increase of $9.6 million. Transactional interest income was comprised of gain on sale of bonds and accretion income on discounted notes. We hold investments in both par value notes receivable and discounted notes. Accretion income on discounted notes decreased $16.5 million from 2000 due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed. However, this was offset by a $26.1 million gain recognized from the sale of certain tax exempt bonds. The conventional real estate contribution to Free Cash Flow was $732.8 million and $587.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, an increase of $145.2 million or 24.7%. The increase was due to improvements in property operations (96%), acquisitions (2%) and acquisition of limited partnership interests (2%). The changes in the composition of conventional real estate contribution resulted in an increase in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent greater than $900 per unit to 24% from 14% in 2000, and a decrease in contribution from properties with an average monthly rent below $600 per unit to 24% from 37% in 2000. The changes were due to improvements in property operations, acquisitions, limited partnership acquisitions and dispositions. Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report provides additional detail on each component of Free Cash Flow. We believe this disclosure is complementary to the results of operations discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment properties, as well as cash flow from operations generated by our investment management business. Our principal demands for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, acquisitions of and investments in properties, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to limited partners. We consider our cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet short term liquidity demands. In the event that there continues to be an economic downturn or the national economy continues to deteriorate and the cash provided by operating activities is no longer adequate, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2002, we had $99.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $19.6 million from December 31, 2001. In addition, we had $224.9 million of restricted cash ($70 million of which was acquired in the Casden Merger), primarily consisting of reserves and impounds held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2002, our net cash provided by operating activities was $497.3 million, compared to $494.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decline is due primarily to the economic downturn in the national economy and the related deterioration in our operating activities, as well as an increase in our level of operating assets, partially offset by a decrease in our operating liabilities. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2002, our net cash used in investing activities was $786.4 million compared to $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2002 our investing activities related to investments in acquisitions and our existing real estate assets through capital expenditures and redevelopment, as well as 36 dispositions of apartment properties. See further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading "Capital Expenditures." Our acquisitions included the Casden Merger and the New England Properties Acquisition. In addition, we acquired the Villas at Park La Brea and made various acquisitions of limited partnership interests held by third party investors in certain partnerships for which we act as the general partner. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further discussion on these activities. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment, in both cases as compared to alternative uses for our capital. The table below shows our dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2002: Property Type Number of Properties Gross Proceeds Existing Debt / Transaction Costs Net Proceeds Our Share of Net Proceeds (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) Conventional 53 $ 339.6 $ 204.9 $ 134.7 $ 107.4 Commercial 1 0.7 0.7 0.1 Affordable 26 72.5 42.0 30.5 12.0 Senior Living 7 139.0 120.4 18.6 17.7 Total 87 $ 551.8 $ 367.3 $ 184.5 $ 137.2 We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategies (as determined by management from time to time). Proceeds from 2003 dispositions are expected to be at levels above that of 2002, and are planned to be used to reduce debt and fund capital and other operating needs. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by financing activities was $308.6 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $439.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2002 our financing activities related to mortgage financing, short term debt financing, issuance of common and preferred equity, payment of our dividends and payment of our principal debt amortization. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we refinanced or closed 93 mortgage loans generating $1,031.7 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.26%, of which approximately $937.9 million related to consolidated properties (these mortgages do not include the $308.7 million in mortgage loans related to the New England Properties Acquisition that are discussed below). Each loan is non recourse. Among the 93 loans, 81 are individually secured by one of 81 properties with no cross collateralization, and 12 loans totaling $228.4 million are cross collateralized with certain other mortgage loans. After repayment of existing debt and payment of transaction costs totaling $832.0 million, our share of the total $199.7 million in net proceeds was $165.8 million which was used to repay existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes. Further details on these mortgage loans are shown in the table below: Mortgage Type Loan Amount Term Rate (in millions) Conventional Fixed Rate $ 174.5 Up to 20 yr, 20 yr amortization 6.49 % Conventional Fixed Rate 129.5 Up to 10 yr, 30 yr amortization 7.01 Conventional Variable Rate 241.0 3 yr revolving facility 2.85 Tax Exempt Variable Rate 376.8 5 10 yrs 2.47 Affordable Fixed Rate 109.9 15 30 yrs, fully amortizing 6.67 $ 1,031.7 4.26 % In connection with the Casden Merger, we assumed $684.7 million of primarily long term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 6.85%. Each of the notes is individually secured by one of 116 properties with no cross collateralization. 37 In connection with the New England Properties Acquisition, we closed 11 mortgage loans generating $308.7 million of long term, fixed rate, fully amortizing notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Each loan is non recourse and is individually secured by one of the 11 properties, with no cross collateralization. In connection with our purchase of the Villas at Park La Brea, we closed a $38.0 million, long term, fixed rate, fully amortizing note with an interest rate of 6.01%. This note is non recourse and secured by the property. As of December 31, 2002, substantially all of the Companys owned or controlled properties and 86.5% of our total assets were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had total secured outstanding indebtedness of $6,233.7 million, comprised of $4,582.9 million of secured long term financing, $1,244.8 million of secured tax exempt long term bond financing and $406.0 million in secured short term financing. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 22.6% of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, of which $786.2 million, or 12.6%, is tax exempt bond financing. As of December 31, 2002, we had a total of 49 mortgage loans, with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of $573.4 million, that were cross collateralized with certain other mortgage loans. Other than these loans, none of our debt is subject to cross collateralization provisions. The weighted average interest rate on our long term secured notes payable and tax exempt bonds was 6.49%, with a weighted average maturity of 14 years as of December 31, 2002. In 2002 we issued the following equity: 3.5 million shares of Common Stock, valued at $164.9 million, in connection with the Casden Merger 2.0 million shares of Class R Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in two registered public offerings, with total net proceeds of approximately $50 million used to repay short term indebtedness 8.0 million shares of Common Stock in a registered public offering at a net price of $46.17 per share. The total net proceeds of approximately $369 million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and a portion of the Casden Loan. Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of Common Stock and our preferred stock. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately 1.9 million shares, of which up to 1.9 million shares may be Common Stock and up to 1.7 million shares may be preferred stock. While we have no current plans to repurchase Common Stock or our preferred stock, these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased no shares of Common Stock or preferred stock. It is the present policy of our Board of Directors to increase the dividend annually in an amount equal to one half of the projected increase in AFFO subject to minimum distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status. Our Board of Directors considers the discretionary nature of Capital Enhancement spending in its consideration of AFFO as it relates to our dividend policy. The dividend paid in February 2003 of $0.82 per share, which was the same dividend amount as was paid in each quarter of 2002, represents a distribution of 96% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 78% of FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. We continue to monitor the dividend as a percentage of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements). If the payout were to exceed 100% for a sustained period, our Board of Directors would consider a change in the dividend to match our operating profitability. On November 7, 2001, AIMCO and the AIMCO Operating Partnership filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, with respect to an aggregate of $822 million of debt and equity securities of AIMCO and $500 million of debt securities of the AIMCO Operating Partnership, all of which was carried forward from AIMCOs 1998 shelf registration statement. The SEC declared the registration statement effective on November 9, 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately $400 million of debt and equity available and the AIMCO Operating Partnership had $500 million of debt available from this registration statement. We expect to finance acquisitions of real estate interests with the issuance of equity and debt securities under the shelf registration statement as well as with cash from operations or short term borrowings. 38 Credit Facility and Term Loan On February 14, 2003, we and our lenders amended our revolving credit facility to increase the available commitment, at our option, to $500 million (such commitment in excess of $400 million is not available until it has been syndicated), reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.60:1 to 1.50:1 through the maturity date and extend the maturity date one year to July 31, 2005. Upon the effective date of the amendment, the margin on LIBOR based loans and base rate loans was amended to a range between 2.05% to 2.65% and .55% to 1.15%, respectively, based on the fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, we and our lenders amended the Casden Loan with the same reduction in the fixed charge coverage ratio as stated above for the credit facility, through maturity, and to eliminate mandatory prepayments for the remainder of the term using proceeds from equity, sales or refinancing proceeds (except as such proceeds arise from transactions of the properties acquired in the Casden Merger). The financial covenants contained in the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the Casden Loan require us to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than 0.55 to 1.0, and an interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0. In addition, the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the Casden Loan limit us from distributing more than 80% of our Funds From Operations over any 12 month period (or such amounts as may be necessary for us to maintain our status as a REIT). Finally, the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 through February 13, 2003 (at which time the coverage ratios were further amended as indicated above) was 1.60:1. As of December 31, 2002, we were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements. Future Capital Needs We expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales, short term borrowings and operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2002, we had 10 properties with 3,678 units under redevelopment having an estimated total investment (fair market value prior to redevelopment plus new redevelopment spending) of $601 million, of which approximately $34 million remains to be spent. Our share of the estimated total investment is $501 million of which approximately $21 million remains to be spent. During 2003, we have: $178.9 million of scheduled maturities of property debt that we expect to refinance; $134.6 million of scheduled principal amortization payments on property debt that we expect to pay with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales; and $406.0 million of short term debt ($291.0 million on the credit facility and $115.0 million on the Casden Loan) that we expect to repay a portion of with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales. Capital Expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2002, we spent a total of $82.9 million and $8.0 million on Capital Replacements (expenditures required to maintain the related asset) and on Capital Enhancements (expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property), respectively. Capital Replacements spending has increased for two primary reasons: a general increase in spending to maintain our assets; and an increase in capitalized costs. In addition to Capital Replacements, we monitor Capital Enhancements, which we distinguish from Capital Replacements. Capital Enhancements are costs incurred to add additional rental square footage, a new building or a new revenue producing feature. For example, replacement of existing kitchen appliances is a Capital Replacement, however, if the same replacements are done in connection with an extensive remodeling project then they are characterized as a Capital Enhancement. Because the distinction between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements is not consistently applied across REITs and because there is a risk of partial substitution between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, we monitor and report both Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements and deduct both in our calculation of AFFO. 39 The table below details our actual spending on Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements based on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 173,000 units) for the year ended December 31, 2002 and reconciles it to our 2002 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Useful Life in Yrs Capital Replacements Actual Cost Per Unit Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Per Unit Total CR/CE Annual Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Actual Cost Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Total CR/CE Annual Cost (in thousands) (in thousands) (in thousands) Carpets 5 $ 108 $ $ 108 $ 18,795 $ 11 $ 18,806 Flooring 5 26 26 4,509 77 4,586 Appliances 5 33 3 36 5,731 447 6,178 Blinds/shades 5 6 6 961 4 965 Furnace/air 5 37 1 38 6,423 112 6,535 Hot water heaters 5 10 10 1,646 21 1,667 Kitchen/bath 5 13 1 14 2,207 90 2,297 Exterior painting 5 13 1 14 2,338 186 2,524 Landscaping 5 17 1 18 2,987 243 3,230 Pool/exercise facilities 5 15 1 16 2,519 221 2,740 Computers, miscellaneous 5 17 17 2,865 2,865 Roofs 15 10 10 1,716 1,716 Parking lot 15 10 10 1,775 87 1,862 Building (electrical, elevator, plumbing) 15 74 5 79 12,899 887 13,786 Submetering 15 27 27 4,602 4,602 Capitalized payroll 5 89 6 95 15,511 984 16,495 Total Companys share $ 478 $ 46 $ 524 $ 82,882 $ 7,972 $ 90,854 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 10,667 379 11,046 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (11,168 ) (823 ) (11,991 ) Total spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 82,381 $ 7,528 $ 89,909 In addition, we capitalized approximately $8.8 million of our share of indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, increasing our share of Capital Replacement ($90.4 million) and Capital Enhancement ($9.2 million) spending to $99.6 million. We funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under our credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we spent a total of $170.9 million for initial capital expenditures, or ICE, (expenditures at a property that have been identified, at the time the property is acquired, as expenditures to be incurred within one year of the acquisition, which in this period relates primarily to the properties acquired in the Casden Merger) and redevelopment (expenditures that substantially upgrade the property). The following table reconciles our share of those expenditures to our 2002 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2002 ICE Redevelopment Total Conventional Assets $ 29.5 $ 131.0 $ 160.5 Affordable Assets 6.6 3.8 10.4 Total Companys share 36.1 134.8 170.9 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 1.6 20.5 22.1 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (3.0 ) (9.8 ) (12.8 ) Total ICE and redevelopment spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 34.7 $ 145.5 $ 180.2 In addition, we capitalized approximately $15.4 million of our share of direct and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, increasing our share of ICE and redevelopment spending to $186.3 million. We funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under our credit facility. 40 During 2001 and 2002, we refined our process for identifying and capitalizing certain indirect costs, which include the implementation of a detailed time reporting system to measure such activities more accurately. As a result of the refined process, we capitalized approximately $40.7 million of our share of indirect costs for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, for a reduction of approximately $7.4 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which interests were acquired through acquisitions, direct purchases and separate offers to other limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships range from 1% to 55%. However, based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements, which grant varying degrees of control, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding contractual obligations and commitments (amounts in thousands): 2003 2004 and 2005 2006 and 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 313,514 $ 536,355 $ 906,461 $ 4,071,386 $ 5,827,716 Secured credit facilities 115,000 115,000 Leases 5,549 9,311 7,583 22,443 Development fee payments (1) 10,000 20,000 2,500 32,500 Total $ 329,063 $ 680,666 $ 916,544 $ 4,071,386 $ 5,997,659 (1)The development fee payments above were established in connection with the Casden Merger and our commitment as it relates to the Casden Development Company, LLC. We agreed to pay $2.5 million per quarter for five years up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million to Casden Development Company, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services. Additionally, we have committed to invest up to $50 million for a 20% limited liability company interest in Casden Properties, LLC, a newly formed company controlled by third parties. As of December 31, 2002, we had invested $11.7 million (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information). 41  ITEM 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds or long term debt financings. We had $1,411.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, which represented 22.6% of our total outstanding debt. Of the total variable debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($786.2 million), floating rate secured notes ($219.0 million), the Casden Loan ($115.0 million), and the credit facility ($291.0 million). Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $14.1 million on an annual basis. Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Variable rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Bond Market Association Municipal Swap Index (the "BMA Index"). Since 1981, the BMA Index has averaged 54.2% of the 10 year Treasury Yield. If this relationship continues and based on our level of tax exempt debt, an increase of 1% in taxable interest rates would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by $10.5 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $4,822.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2001, based on our level of variable debt of $925.1 million, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have resulted in our income and cash flows being reduced by $9.3 million on an annual basis. The year ended December 31, 2002 had an increased potential reduction of $4.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 due to our increased variable debt balance in 2002, as a result of our acquisitions and newly consolidated properties. As of December 31, 2002, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds were as follows (dollars in thousands): Amortization Maturities Total Percentage 2003 $ 134,575 $ 178,939 $ 313,514 5.4 % 2004 145,628 69,562 215,190 3.7 % 2005 153,664 167,501 321,165 5.5 % 2006 157,455 384,860 542,315 9.3 % 2007 164,289 199,857 364,146 6.2 % Thereafter 4,071,386 69.9 % $ 5,827,716 100.0 % The estimated aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short term secured debt as of December 31, 2002 approximate their carrying value due to their relatively short term nature. Management further believes that the fair value of our variable rate secured tax exempt bond debt and variable rate secured long term debt approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements were estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues. The carrying amount of our fixed rate debt at December 31, 2002 was $4.8 billion compared to the computed fair value of $5.5 billion (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report).
