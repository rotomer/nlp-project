ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or managed a real estate portfolio of 1,629 apartment properties containing 287,560 units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Funds From Operations, or FFO, less spending for Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements; same store property operating results; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, or Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. These terms are defined and described in the sections captioned "Funds From Operations" and "Capital Expenditures" below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; unemployment rates; single family and multifamily starts; and interest rates. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments substantially influences our results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties can affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms which we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. We have grown rapidly over the past decade, and during the past three years our growth has moderated. In 2003, the apartment industry continued to face a challenging operating environment unemployment, job growth at a pace slower than anticipated, low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing alternatives. In addition, we experienced greater difficulty as compared to our peers because our property operating systems and structure were not as effective as our peers in meeting the challenges presented by the apartment markets. We are adjusting our business strategies to compete successfully in challenging times and to be ready to maximize our opportunities as the economy improves. We are focused on improving our conventional property operations, which are conducted through 15 regional operating centers, or ROCs. This structure provides us with the opportunity to keep decision making close to the customers we serve and the properties we maintain. We are focused on providing our ROCs with more resources and better systems and reducing employee turnover. We are standardizing numerous processes, including such items as price setting and resident selection. Our focus on resident selection is designed to make our communities more desirable places to live and work, which will result in better financial performance due to higher and more stable occupancy levels, increased pricing power and reduced costs. We were highly focused throughout 2003 in addressing property operations and those efforts will continue throughout 2004. In addition, we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through redevelopment and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 22 Results of Operations Overview 2003 compared to 2002 We recognized net income attributable to common stockholders of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 13.5%. This decrease was principally due to: a decline in consolidated same store net operating results of 11.6% in 2003 compared to 2002; higher depreciation and interest expenses due to the acquisition of apartment properties; lower interest income as a result of a decline in accretion income recognized on general partner notes receivable; and a decrease in the operations of our investment management business. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate (including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain relating to unconsolidated entities) due to property sales; an increase in net operating income due to the acquisition of apartment properties; and lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results. 2002 compared to 2001 We recognized net income attributable to common stockholders of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $58.5 million. This increase was principally due to: an increase in net operating income due to the acquisition of apartment properties; lower depreciation expense due to a change in estimate related to the useful lives of real estate assets; higher equity in earnings in our unconsolidated real estate partnerships due to a change in estimate related to the useful lives of real estate assets; lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results; a decrease in deficit distributions to minority partners; and a reduction in amortization of intangibles. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in loss on disposition of real estate (including the loss recognized in discontinued operations and the loss relating to unconsolidated entities) due primarily to a 2002 change in estimate associated with historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of properties and the sale of certain senior living facilities in 2002; a decline in consolidated same store net operating results of 6.5% in 2002 compared to 2001; higher depreciation and interest expenses due to the acquisition of apartment properties; and a decrease in the operations of our investment management business. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting our results of operations in more detail. 23 Rental Property Operations Our net income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties. The principal components within our total consolidated property operations are as follows: Consolidated same store properties consist of all conventional properties that were owned, stabilized and consolidated for all periods presented. Acquisition Properties consist of all consolidated properties that were owned less than three years as of the end of the most recent year. For purposes of this discussion, acquisition properties are principally comprised of: three properties directly purchased in 2003; those properties acquired in the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc. and certain related transactions, which we refer to collectively, as the Casden Merger; those properties acquired in the August 2002 acquisition of New England area properties, which we refer to as the New England Properties Acquisition; two properties directly purchased in 2002 and three properties directly purchased in 2001. Newly Consolidated Properties consist of all properties consolidated for less than three years as of the end of the most recent year. These properties had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method. For purposes of this discussion, newly consolidated properties include 10 properties that were first consolidated in 2003, 78 properties that were first consolidated in 2002 and five properties that were first consolidated in 2001. Affordable properties consist of all affordable properties (which are properties that benefit from governmental programs designed to provide housing for people with low or moderate incomes) that were owned, stabilized and consolidated for all periods presented. Redevelopment properties consist of all consolidated properties where (i) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations and have not been stabilized for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (ii) other significant renovation (such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (on lease expirations)) is underway or has been complete for less than one year as of the earliest period presented. In both cases, the properties have been removed from same store properties. Other properties consist of all consolidated properties that are not included in the above categories and in some cases are not multifamily properties (such as commercial properties and retail space). Partnership expenses consist of expenses incurred at the partnership level either directly or indirectly (such as partnership audit, tax and legal expenses). Property management expenses consist of off site expenses associated with the self management of consolidated properties. The following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Rental and other property revenues $ 1,445,796 $ 1,292,352 $ 1,123,325 Property operating expenses 642,697 515,363 428,400 Net operating income $ 803,099 $ 776,989 $ 694,925 24 The following table shows the components of consolidated property net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Consolidated same store properties $ 565,721 $ 640,066 $ 684,456 Acquisition properties 139,429 94,789 2,171 Newly consolidated properties 95,458 42,837 4,140 Affordable properties 7,777 7,292 8,977 Redevelopment properties 15,733 14,578 20,231 Other properties 4,641 2,983 4,141 Partnership expenses (9,993 ) (9,614 ) (8,147 ) Property management expenses (18,946 ) (15,942 ) (21,044 ) Other 3,279 Total $ 803,099 $ 776,989 $ 694,925 During 2003 as compared to 2002, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $26.1 million, or 3.4%. This increase was principally due to $52.6 million and $44.6 million related to operations of newly consolidated properties and operations of acquisition properties, respectively. This was offset by a $74.3 million, or 11.6%, decrease in consolidated same store net operating income. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results." During 2002 as compared to 2001, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $82.1 million, or 11.8%. This increase was principally due to $92.6 million and $38.7 million related to operations of acquisition properties and operations of newly consolidated properties, respectively. This was offset by a $44.4 million, or 6.5%, decrease in consolidated same store net operating income. See further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results." Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define "same store" properties as conventional properties in which our ownership interest exceeds 10% and the operations of which are stabilized for all periods presented. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. The following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations on a "same store" basis (which is not in accordance with GAAP) and reconciles them to "consolidated same store" operations, a 25 component of consolidated rental property operations (which is in accordance with GAAP) described in the above comparative discussions (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Our share of same store revenues $ 1,038,942 $ 1,075,810 $ 1,098,089 Our share of same store expense 441,179 401,530 384,246 Our share of same store net operating income $ 597,763 $ 674,280 $ 713,843 Minority partners share of same store net operating income 56,610 65,296 71,762 Our share of unconsolidated same store net operating income (25,690 ) (28,022 ) (97,661 ) Newly consolidated properties (62,962 ) (71,488 ) (3,488 ) Consolidated same store component of net operating income $ 565,721 $ 640,066 $ 684,456 Same Store Statistics Properties 553 553 553 Apartment units 154,324 154,324 154,324 Average physical occupancy 91.8 % 92.6 % 93.5 % Average rent collected/unit/month $ 687 $ 703 $ 703 For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, our share of same store net operating income decreased $76.5 million, or 11.3%. Revenues decreased $36.9 million, or 3.4%, primarily due to lower average rent (down $16 per unit), lower occupancy (down 0.8%), and increased bad debt. Expenses increased by $39.6 million, or 9.9%, primarily due to: an increase of $12.5 million in turnover, marketing and administrative costs in 2003 related to focused efforts to improve property appearance and the condition of units ready to be occupied; $8.8 million in contract services and repairs and maintenance primarily driven by seasonal factors such as landscaping and snow removal due to more severe winter conditions in 2003 than in 2002; $6.7 million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas, electric, water and sewer; and $4.0 million in property hazard insurance due to increased casualty losses. For the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, our share of same store net operating income decreased $39.6 million, or 5.5%. Revenues decreased $22.3 million, or 2.0%, primarily due to lower occupancy (down 0.9%), and increased bad debt. Expenses increased by $17.3 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to: an increase of $4.8 million in property taxes; $3.8 million in insurance expense, as the cost of property hazard insurance coverage rose in March 2002; and $5.4 million in contract services and repairs and maintenance. These increases were somewhat offset by reductions in utilities. Investment Management Business We earn income from our consolidated investment management business primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner. The income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property and asset management. Asset management involves the financial management of properties, as opposed to the day to day property operations, and results in fees from a variety of transactions including refinancing fees, developer fees and syndication fees. These transactions occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period. Our revenue from the investment management business decreases as we increase our ownership of properties and the income generated is therefore eliminated in consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by GAAP. Offsetting the revenue earned in the investment management business are the expenses associated with property and asset management, as well as expenses related to our risk management and other insurance programs. 26 The following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated investment management business for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Management fees and other income primarily from affiliates $ 70,487 $ 95,479 $ 149,712 Management and other expenses 50,574 64,031 97,439 Net income from investment management business $ 19,913 $ 31,448 $ 52,273 During 2003 as compared to 2002, income from investment management business decreased by $11.5 million, or 36.7%. This decrease was principally a result of the following: $16.0 million due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships, which required additional elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships; $8.0 million due to increased consulting fees associated with the implementation of site level software and legal fees; and $3.2 million related to insurance, of which $7.5 million was related to an increase in general liability, workers compensation and director and officer insurance premium expenses offset by $4.3 million of a reduction in casualty losses in the property hazard program. These decreases were partially offset by: $4.6 million of increased activity based fees related to syndication, acquisition and deferred asset management fees from transactions closed in 2003; and $15.1 million due to income tax benefits including: $8.0 million of an income tax valuation reserve reversal in first quarter 2003 (see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report); and $7.1 million of an income tax benefit resulting from losses recorded at our taxable REIT subsidiaries. During 2002 as compared to 2001, income from the investment management business decreased by $20.8 million, or 39.8%. This decrease was principally a result of the following: $13.2 million of reduced fees billed for construction management services in 2002. We calculated and billed these fees to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities. In addition, lower costs were incurred and therefore lower billings occurred as a result of the ongoing management initiative to contain costs; $7.3 million due to an increase in insurance costs in the property hazard program. These increased costs were the result of increased reserves due to historical casualty losses from prior years; $5.5 million due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships, which required additional elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such real estate partnerships; $4.5 million due to a net reduction in fees including: $6.9 million decrease in refinancing and disposition fees, due to decreased refinancing transactions (28 in 2002 compared to 59 in 2001) resulting in lower fees earned; and a $7.7 million decrease in fees earned for services provided to third parties due to a planned reduction in third party asset management. These decreases were offset by a $10.1 million increase in asset management and developer fees related to the 2002 acquisition of National Partnership Investments Corp. as part of the Casden Merger. 27 These decreases were partially offset by $9.3 million of lower compensation and health insurance expense resulting from a change in plan administrator and a reduction in work force, in part due to a planned reduction in third party property management and management cost reduction initiatives. Depreciation of Rental Property For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation of rental property increased $62.0 million, or 23.3%. This increase was principally due to $23.4 million and $23.5 million of additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties, respectively, as well as $12.3 million of additional depreciation related to new capital spending on same store properties. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, depreciation of rental property decreased $36.2 million, or 12.0%. This decrease was principally due to a $69.0 million decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets made in 2001. During 2001, we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation. As a result of this review, we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings. We believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice. This change in useful lives increased net income by approximately $74.3 million, net of minority interest, in 2002 over 2001, of which a portion was recognized as an increase to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. The recognition of this change in useful lives resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.87 and $0.86, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties of $24.0 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Amortization of Intangibles For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, amortization of intangibles increased $2.7 million, or 66.5%. This increase was principally a result of additional amortization recognized due to the termination of certain management contracts acquired in the Casden Merger. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, amortization of intangibles decreased $14.7 million, or 78.5%. Of the total decrease, $6.8 million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully amortized in 2001, and $7.9 million was attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Provision for Losses on Accounts, Fees and Notes Receivable For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable decreased $6.8 million, or 75.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable increased $2.4 million, or 35.5%. In 2001, the entire provision of $6.6 million related to additional allowance for possible losses on accounts, fees and other contingencies. In 2002, the entire provision of $9.0 million related to provision for losses on notes receivable, which provision was determined based on our review in 2002 of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio. In 2003, we recorded a $2.2 million provision for losses on notes receivable. We continue to monitor these loans 28 and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis and may record a provision due to changes in the market environment that affect operating cash flows. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $48.3 million, or 14.9%. This increase was principally due to $26.6 million and $21.3 million of additional interest on the debt related to the newly consolidated properties and the acquisition properties, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $44.4 million, or 15.8%. This increase was principally due to $34.8 million and $16.4 million of additional interest on the debt related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a $10.9 million reduction related to an overall decrease in variable interest rates of approximately 1.5% from the prior year. Interest and Other Income A component of interest and other income is our accretion income on general partner notes receivable. Transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, interest and other income decreased $52.3 million, or 67.6%. This decrease was principally a result of: $33.5 million in reduced accretion income; $11.1 million in lower interest due from general partner notes receivable, resulting from the consolidation of real estate partnerships, and therefore the elimination of interest income, as well as the collection of outstanding notes receivable; and $7.7 million related to gain recognized in second quarter 2002 on the sale of certain tax exempt bonds. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, interest and other income increased $3.4 million, or 4.6%. This increase was principally a result of $26.9 million in increased accretion income. This increase was offset by $18.4 million of a decrease related to a lower gain recognized on certain tax exempt bonds that were sold in 2002 as compared to certain tax exempt bonds sold in 2001. In addition there was a $3.8 million decrease related to lower interest on money market and interest bearing accounts, as interest rates on deposit accounts had decreased approximately 1.5% from the prior year, while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $7.1 million. This increase was principally the result of the purchase of equity interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that resulted in these properties becoming consolidated. Such real estate partnerships owned better performing properties that are now contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses. In addition, the remaining properties within unconsolidated real estate partnerships had decreased earnings driven by lower property operating results in 2003 than in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001, equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $17.4 million. This increase was principally due to the change in estimate of useful lives of the underlying real estate assets completed by us in 2001, which resulted in lower depreciation expense of approximately $16.0 million. See the 29 previous discussion on the change in estimate of useful lives of assets under the heading "Depreciation of Rental Property." Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of their minority interest balances, we record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over their minority interest balances, even though there is no economic effect or cost. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $4.3 million, or 16.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $19.4 million. Each of these decreases were due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity, and decreased operating results, as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships. Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, gain on dispositions of real estate increased $25.5 million. In 2002, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate included a loss of approximately $28.0 million that resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold. The recognition of this amount in 2002 was considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties. The recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, gain on dispositions of real estate decreased $39.8 million. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, or SFAS 144. Pursuant to SFAS 144 we now report as discontinued operations assets held for sale (as defined by SFAS 144) and assets sold in the current period (see below discussion). As a result of SFAS 144, for the year ended December 31, 2002, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during 2002. For 2001, however, gain (loss) on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with the disposal of all properties sold. The properties sold in all periods, as well as the properties held for sale, were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Gain (loss) on properties sold was determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased $12.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased $22.3 million. Both of these decreases were principally a result of decreased earnings caused by lower property operating results than in the prior year and our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, thereby reducing the minority interest allocation. 30 Discontinued Operations For properties accounted for under SFAS 144, the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest. In addition, any impairments on assets held for sale, and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale is reported as discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, income from discontinued operations totaled $88.1 million, $9.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively, which includes income from operations of $7.9 million, $23.2 million and $15.5 million, respectively. In 2003, the income from operations included 82 properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during 2003. In 2002, and 2001, the income from operations included 124 properties that were sold or classified as held for sale in 2002 and 2003. Due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales, the income from operations is not comparable year to year. During 2003, we sold 72 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $89.7 million (which is net of $12.1 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $9.0 million in impairment loss on assets sold or held for sale in 2003. During 2002, we sold 42 properties, resulting in a net loss on sale of approximately $8.5 million (including $2.5 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $2.9 million in impairments on assets sold or held for sale in 2002. There were no gains or losses on assets sold in 2001 included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gains (losses) on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable year over year due to individual property differences. We considered the properties sold, as well as the properties classified as held for sale, to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. See Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details on discontinued operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation, unless considered impaired. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired, we make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; 31 local conditions, such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate, goodwill and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition We generally recognize interest income earned from our investments in notes receivable when the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and reasonably estimable. The notes receivable were either extended by us and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes, or were made by predecessors whose positions we acquired usually at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. On a periodic basis we assess the collectibility or impairment of each note. Under the cost recovery method, we carry the discounted notes at the acquisition amount, less subsequent cash collections, until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are reasonably estimable. Based upon closed or pending transactions (which include sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings), we have determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value. Accordingly, we recognize accretion income on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. For the year ended December 31, 2003, if we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have decreased by $3.3 million ($0.03 million per basic and diluted share). Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We estimate the collectibility of notes receivable by assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables. We establish an allowance for losses on notes receivable based on an evaluation of a variety of factors, such as: an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio; an evaluation of the risk inherent in the portfolio, including the current credit worthiness of each borrower; the composition of the portfolio, including specific impaired notes receivable; current economic conditions; full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral; economic conditions; historical loss experience; our estimate of probable credit losses and other factors. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we identified and recorded $2.2 million and $9.0 million in losses on notes receivable, respectively. We will continue to monitor and assess these notes, and we may make changes in required reserves in the future due to changes in the market environment. 32 Capitalized Costs We capitalize direct and indirect costs (including salaries, interest, real estate taxes and other costs) incurred in connection with redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, disposition capital expenditures, Capital Enhancement and Capital Replacement activities. We charge to expense as incurred indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses. The amounts capitalized depend on the volume, timing and costs of such activities. As a result, changes in volume, timing and costs of such activities may have a significant effect on our financial results if the costs being capitalized are not proportionately increased or reduced, as the case may be. Based on the level of capital spending during 2003, if capital activities had increased or decreased during the year by 10%, we could have had additional or lower, respectively, income before minority interest of $6.3 million. See further discussion under the heading "Capital Expenditures." Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, gains on dispositions of depreciable real estate, gains on dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. We calculate FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for amortization of intangibles and deficit distributions to minority partners. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock, adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 33  For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, our FFO is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 Net income attributable to common stockholders(1) $ 65,292 $ 75,488 $ 17,021 Adjustments: Depreciation on rental property, net of minority partners interest(2) 298,255 241,325 295,113 Depreciation on rental property related to unconsolidated entities 25,817 33,549 57,506 (Gain) loss on dispositions of real estate (3,178 ) 22,362 (17,394 ) Deficit distributions to minority partners 22,672 26,979 46,359 Amortization of intangibles 6,702 4,026 18,729 Income tax arising from disposals 3,202 Gain on disposition of land 3,843 Discontinued operations: Depreciation on rental property, net of minority partners interest 14,906 29,580 37,936 (Gain) loss on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest (101,849 ) 6,021 Deficit distributions to minority partners (10,718 ) 1,321 1,342 Income tax arising from disposals 12,134 2,507 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (29,910 ) (44,500 ) (58,883 ) Preferred stock dividends 85,920 93,558 90,331 Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs 7,645 Funds From Operations $ 393,688 $ 492,216 $ 495,105 Preferred stock dividends (85,920 ) (93,558 ) (90,331 ) Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs (7,645 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 11,330 38,091 64,389 Interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 987 1,161 1,568 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 312,440 $ 437,910 $ 470,731 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding: Common shares and equivalents(3) 92,968 86,773 73,648 Dilutive preferred securities 3,639 9,588 16,790 Total 96,607 96,361 90,438 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 430,258 $ 497,289 $ 494,457 Cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities 311,904 (786,377 ) (132,010 ) Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities (727,283 ) 308,641 (439,562 ) Notes: (1)Represents our numerator for earnings per common share calculated in accordance with GAAP (2)"Minority partners interest," as referenced on this line item and others in this presentation means minority interest in Aimcos consolidated real estate partnerships (3)Represents our denominator for earnings per common share diluted calculated in accordance with GAAP Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that the cash provided by operating activities no longer covers our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability, proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term 34 liquidity demands. We use the Revolver (described below) for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2003, we had $114.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $16.3 million of cash and cash equivalents that is included within Assets Held for Sale), an increase of $14.9 million from December 31, 2002, which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance on the Revolver. At December 31, 2003, we had $254.6 million of restricted cash (including $8.8 million of restricted cash that is included within Assets Held for Sale), primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2003, our net cash provided by operating activities of $430.3 million was primarily due to operating income from our consolidated properties, which is determined by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. This was a decrease of $67 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, driven by lower property operating results. We intend for our net cash from operating activities to fund dividends paid to stockholders. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2003, our net cash provided by investing activities of $311.9 million was primarily from proceeds received from sales of properties, offset by investments in our existing real estate assets through capital expenditures and redevelopment (see further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading "Capital Expenditures"). Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment, in both cases, as compared to alternative uses for our capital. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold 72 consolidated properties, one consolidated land parcel, and 37 unconsolidated properties. These were sold for an aggregate sales price of $939.0 million, of which $697.6 million related to the consolidated properties and land parcel. Our share of the total net proceeds, after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $309.6 million, of which $9.6 million related to the unconsolidated properties, which proceeds were included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness, redeem preferred securities, and for other corporate purposes. We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Proceeds from 2004 dispositions are expected to be slightly below the levels of 2003, and we plan to use such proceeds to reduce debt, redeem preferred securities, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. 35 Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2003, net cash used in financing activities of $727.3 million related primarily to payments on our secured notes payable, payment of our dividends and redemptions of preferred stock. These were offset by contributions from minority interest related to our equity financing transaction with GE Real Estate in the form of a joint venture, proceeds from the issuance of Class S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the Class S Preferred Stock, and Class T Cumulative Preferred Stock, which we refer to as the Class T Preferred Stock, proceeds from mortgage refinancings and borrowings under a newly established Term Loan (see notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on these activities). Mortgage Debt During the year ended December 31, 2003, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 60 consolidated properties generating $440.3 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 4.13%. Our net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $132.5 million. In addition, we closed mortgage loans on 32 unconsolidated properties, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, for net proceeds of $13.0 million, which proceeds are included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, within investing activities. Our total net proceeds from these loans of $145.5 million was used to repay existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes. In 2004 we intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans We have an outstanding revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the Revolver, with a syndicate of financial institutions having aggregate lending commitments of $500 million, of which $445 million has been syndicated. At December 31, 2003, the Revolver had an outstanding principal balance of $81.0 million and an interest rate of 4.00% based on weighted average LIBOR contracts outstanding with various maturities plus 2.85%. The Revolver matures in July 2005. The amount available under the Revolver at December 31, 2003 was $348 million (less $22.4 million outstanding for letters for credit). The maximum amount available for borrowing under the Revolver fluctuates based on established criteria defined therein and is typically the $445 million that has been syndicated. In May 2003, we borrowed $250 million through a syndicated term loan, which we refer to as the Term Loan. We used proceeds of this borrowing to pay down the Revolver. The Term Loan matures in May 2008 and is repayable at our option at any time without penalty. At December 31, 2003, the Term Loan had an outstanding principal balance of $250 million and an interest rate of 3.89% (based on a designated LIBOR rate plus 2.85%). All financial covenant requirements of the Term Loan are the same as the Revolver and the term loan we entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions in connection with the Casden Merger in March 2002, which we refer to as the Casden Loan. At December 31, 2003, the Casden Loan had an outstanding principal balance of $104.4 million and an interest rate of 3.98% (based on a designated LIBOR rate plus 2.85%). The Casden Loan matures in March 2004, however, subsequent to December 31, 2003, we extended the maturity of the Casden Loan to March 2005. (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on the Revolver, Term Loan and Casden Loan). Equity Transactions In April 2003, we issued $100 million of newly created variable rate Class S Preferred Stock. The initial dividend rate on the Class S Preferred Stock is based on three month LIBOR plus 2.75% and 36 then from April 30, 2004 through October 31, 2004 increases to the three month LIBOR plus 6.0%, with additional increases thereafter. In July 2003, we issued $150 million of newly created 8.00% Class T Preferred Stock. With proceeds from these issuances we redeemed $240 million of outstanding preferred securities in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $250 million of debt and equity available and the Aimco Operating Partnership had $500 million of debt available on our shelf registration statement declared effective in 2001. (See Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on the shelf registration statement and preferred securities.) We intend to continue to issue preferred securities in both public and private offerings to generate proceeds that we will use to redeem higher cost preferred securities, to finance acquisitions of real estate interests and for other corporate purposes. In December 2003 we entered into an equity financing with GE Real Estate in the form of a joint venture, which we refer to the as the GE JV. At closing, we contributed to the GE JV 33 of our apartment properties with a total of 9,534 units and GE Real Estate contributed cash of which we received approximately $107 million before transaction costs and funding of reserves. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on the GE JV.) Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of Common Stock and our preferred stock. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately 1.9 million shares, of which up to 1.9 million shares may be Common Stock and up to 1.7 million shares may be preferred stock. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we repurchased no shares of our Common Stock or our preferred stock. See Note 22 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on Common Stock repurchased subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2003. In November 2003, our Board of Directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend to align the amount of the dividend with our current level of operating profitability. The dividend paid in February 2004 of $0.60 per share represents a distribution of 103% of diluted Adjusted Funds From Operations, which we refer to as AFFO, (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 83% of diluted FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. (See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the definition of AFFO). Capital Expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2003, we spent a total of $86.7 million on Capital Replacements (expenditures required to maintain the related asset) and $2.6 million on Capital Enhancements (expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property). These amounts represent our share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships. Capital Replacements spending increased slightly over prior periods due to a general increase in spending to maintain our assets. In addition to Capital Replacements, we account for Capital Enhancements, which we distinguish from Capital Replacements. Capital Enhancements are costs incurred to add additional rental square footage or a new revenue producing feature. For example, replacement of existing kitchen appliances is a Capital Replacement, however, if the same replacements are done in connection with an extensive remodeling project that is expected to generate higher rents, then they are characterized as a Capital Enhancement. Because the distinction between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements is not consistently applied across REITs and because there is a risk of partial substitution between Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements, we account for and report both Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements and deduct both in our calculation of 37 AFFO (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the definition of AFFO). The table below details our actual spending on Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements based on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 154,000 ownership equivalent units) for the year ended December 31, 2003 and reconciles it to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the same period (in thousands, except per unit data). Capital Replacements Actual Cost Per Unit Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Per Unit Total Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Actual Cost Capital Enhancements Actual Cost Total Cost Carpets $ 117 $ $ 117 $ 17,994 $ 17 $ 18,011 Flooring 32 32 4,952 4,952 Appliances 34 2 36 5,296 236 5,532 Blinds/shades 5 5 785 785 Furnace/air 35 35 5,409 13 5,422 Hot water heaters 9 9 1,386 21 1,407 Kitchen/bath 13 13 1,932 8 1,940 Exterior painting 25 25 3,853 23 3,876 Landscaping 19 1 20 2,925 149 3,074 Pool/exercise facilities 18 18 2,679 65 2,744 Computers, miscellaneous 26 3 29 4,007 383 4,390 Roofs 17 17 2,674 2 2,676 Parking lot 12 12 1,802 10 1,812 Building (electrical, elevator, plumbing) 72 72 11,017 28 11,045 Submetering 7 7 1,088 1,088 Capitalized payroll and other indirect costs 129 4 133 19,969 566 20,535 Total our share $ 563 $ 17 $ 580 $ 86,680 $ 2,609 $ 89,289 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 10,117 437 10,554 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (6,195 ) (40 ) (6,235 ) Total spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 90,602 $ 3,006 $ 93,608 For the year ended December 31, 2003, we spent a total of $24.8 million for initial capital expenditures, or ICE, which are expenditures at a property that have been identified, at the time the property is acquired, as expenditures to be incurred within a specified period of time following the acquisition, typically one year. In this period, ICE relates primarily to the properties acquired in the Casden Merger and the New England Properties Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we spent a total of $86.5 million for redevelopment, which are expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. The following table reconciles our share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2003 (in millions): ICE Redevelopment Total Conventional Assets $ 15.9 $ 79.1 $ 95.0 Affordable Assets 8.9 7.4 16.3 Total our share 24.8 86.5 111.3 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 0.4 24.9 25.3 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (0.4 ) (8.2 ) (8.6 ) Total spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 24.8 $ 103.2 $ 128.0 38  In 2003, we began to account for a category of capital expenditures known as Disposition Capital Expenditures, which are those capital expenditures made on conventional and affordable properties sold, held for sale or identified as to be sold within one year and capital expenditures on certain of our affordable properties that are expected to be sold upon completion of regulatory requirements. We will review this allocation each quarter and will re allocate to Capital Replacements any items for those properties not sold or no longer identified as to be sold. In 2003 no amounts were reallocated to Capital Replacements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we spent a total of $25.5 million for Disposition Capital Expenditures of this total, $4.3 million related to properties sold in 2003. The following table reconciles our share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2003 (in millions): Disposition Capital Expenditures Conventional Assets $ 15.1 Affordable Assets 10.4 Total our share 25.5 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 2.7 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (4.3 ) Total spending per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 23.9 Included in above spending for ICE, redevelopment and disposition capital expenditures, is approximately $17.5 million of our share of indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2003. We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves, and borrowings under the Revolver. Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 (amounts in thousands): Total Less than one Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 5,648,901 $ 207,245 $ 836,203 $ 753,900 $ 3,851,553 Secured credit facility and term loans 435,387 11,387 174,000 250,000 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 113,619 113,619 Leases for space occupied 24,425 5,484 9,615 9,326 Development fee payments(1) 32,500 10,000 20,000 2,500 Total $ 6,254,832 $ 234,116 $ 1,039,818 $ 1,015,726 $ 3,965,172 (1)The development fee payments above were established in connection with the Casden Merger and our commitment as it relates to the Casden Development Company, LLC. We agreed to pay $2.5 million per quarter for five years (up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million) to Casden Development Company, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services on our assets. Additionally, in connection with the Casden Merger, we agreed to purchase two properties for minimum consideration of approximately $563 million (of which $163 million related to The Palazzo at Park La Brea, which closed subsequent to December 31, 2003 see Note 22 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report), provide a stand by facility of $70 million in debt financing associated with development (which was reduced to $64.5 million subsequent to 39 December 31, 2003 in connection with the purchase of The Palazzo at Park La Brea) and invest up to $50 million for a 20% limited liability company interest in Casden Properties, LLC. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for detailed information on these commitments. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in "Contractual Obligations" above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including 1031 exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financings and operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2003, we had under redevelopment eight conventional properties with 5,187 units (which includes three properties for which redevelopment activities were complete but the operations of which had not yet stabilized) and two affordable properties with 467 units. Redevelopment expenditures for five conventional properties with ongoing redevelopment activities will require an estimated total investment (redevelopment spending) of $323 million, of which approximately $48 million remains to be spent. Our share of the estimated total spending on those five properties is $243 million of which approximately $31 million remains to be spent. Additionally, in 2004 we plan to commence as many as 40 redevelopments with average spending per project in the $2 million to $10 million range. During 2004 we also intend to redeem the remainder of the Class S Preferred Stock, which anytime after April 30, 2004 has a redemption price of $25 per share (see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information). Subsequent to December 31, 2003, we redeemed $25 million of the outstanding Class S Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $24.63 (see Note 22 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which interests were acquired through portfolio acquisitions, direct purchases and separate offers to other limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships ranges from 1% to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements, which grant varying degrees of control, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes. In 2003, Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," or FIN 46, which changes the criteria for consolidating entities. We are currently evaluating our treatment of these unconsolidated real estate partnerships under FIN 46, which we will adopt in first quarter 2004 (see Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees (see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt 40 financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds or long term debt financings. We had $1,599.0 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2003. Of the total floating debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($817.5 million), floating rate secured notes ($247.6 million), the revolving credit facility ($81.0 million), term loans ($354.4 million), and the Class S Preferred Stock ($98.5 million). Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $16.0 million on an annual basis. Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the BMA Index, which since 1981 has averaged 54.0% of the 10 year Treasury Yield. If this relationship continues, an increase in interest rates of 1% (0.54% in tax exempt interest rates) would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $11.2 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2003, we had $4,598.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2002, based on our level of floating rate debt of $1,411.2 million, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have resulted in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $14.1 million on an annual basis. The potential reduction of income before minority interests and cash flows due to an increase in interest rates increased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the additional debt related to our acquisitions and newly consolidated properties and the issuance of the Class S Preferred Stock.
