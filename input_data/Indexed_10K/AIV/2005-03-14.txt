Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or managed 1,499 apartment properties containing 263,734 units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Funds From Operations, or FFO; FFO less spending for Capital Replacements, or AFFO; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. These terms are defined and described in the sections captioned Funds From Operations and Capital Expenditures below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; unemployment rates; single family and multifamily housing starts; and interest rates. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments substantially influences our results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties can affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. We have grown rapidly over the past decade, and during the past three years our growth has moderated. During 2004, the apartment industry continued to face a challenging operating environment job growth at a pace slower than anticipated, low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing alternatives. In addition, we experienced greater difficulty as compared to our peers because our property operating systems and structure were not as effective in meeting the challenges presented by the apartment markets. The effect of these operational challenges was mitigated by a favorable investment climate in which we were able to sell properties at attractive prices, generally higher than the cost of replacement. In response to this challenging operating environment and our specific operational issues, during late 2003 and throughout 2004 we adjusted our business strategies to compete successfully in challenging times and to be ready to maximize our opportunities as the economy improves. We focused on a number of areas related to improving operations, including those related to customer service, resident selection and retention, marketing, pricing, and operating cost management. Our resident selection initiatives designed to make our communities more desirable places to live and work, which drives better financial performance from higher and more stable occupancy levels, increased pricing power and reduced costs. In combination, our initiatives are resulting in improved customer service, better pricing decisions, increased resident quality, a focus on sales and marketing and higher employee satisfaction. Our revenue building initiatives are largely completed with processes in place for continued improvement in resident quality, pricing, sales and marketing. Our focus in 2005 will be to continue to increase revenue and work on cost management and productivity initiatives including centralizing purchasing, restructuring business processes, using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending. We believe that our improvement efforts are working and have resulted in a positive trend in certain operating results and are the foundation for long term benefits that we began to realize in the second half of 2004 and expect to continue throughout 2005 and beyond. These initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality, and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview 2004 compared to 2003 We recognized net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to net income of $158.9 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, increases of $104.6 million and $109.4 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate (including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain related to unconsolidated entities and other); and an increase in activity fees and asset management revenues. These increases were partially offset by: an overall decline in net operating income, which included increases related to acquisitions and newly consolidated properties, offset by a decline in same store net operating results; an increase in general and administrative expenses; an increase in interest expense; and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting our results of operations in more detail. 2003 compared to 2002 We recognized net income of $158.9 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to net income of $169.0 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, decreases of $10.1 million and $10.2 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: an overall decline in net operating income, which included increases related to acquisitions and newly consolidated properties, offset by a decline in same store net operating results; an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses; an increase in interest expense; a decrease in interest income; and a decrease in property management revenues. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate (including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain relating to unconsolidated entities); and lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results. Rental Property Operations Our operating income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties. The principal components within our total consolidated property operations are: consolidated same store properties, which consist of all conventional properties that were owned, stabilized and consolidated for all comparable periods presented; and other consolidated entities, which include acquisition, newly consolidated, affordable and redevelopment properties. 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Rental and other property revenues $ 1,401,653 $ 1,336,515 $ 1,188,747 Property operating expenses 668,807 585,185 465,318 Net operating income $ 732,846 $ 751,330 $ 723,429 For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income for our consolidated property operations decreased by $18.5 million, or 2.5%. This decrease was principally due to a $40.3 million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results). Additionally, there was a $6.6 million decrease related to net casualty losses and other costs primarily resulting from hurricanes and tropical storms in the third quarter of 2004, which damaged over 100 of our properties and $4.0 million in higher property management costs. These decreases were offset by an $18.2 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties, which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method (42 properties first consolidated in 2004, which includes 24 properties that were consolidated due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or FIN 46, and 12 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2003) and a $16.0 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004, and three properties purchased in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $27.9 million, or 3.9%. This increase was principally due to $62.2 million related to operations of newly consolidated properties (19 properties first consolidated in 2003 and 78 properties first consolidated in 2002) and $34.6 million related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of three properties purchased in 2003, 115 properties acquired in the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., 11 properties acquired in the August 2002 acquisition of New England area properties, and two properties purchased in 2002. This was partially offset by a $71.1 million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results). Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define same store properties as conventional properties in which our ownership interest exceeds 10% and the operations of which are stabilized for all periods presented. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. The following table summarizes the conventional rental property operations on a same store basis (which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) 24 Table of Contents and reconciles them to consolidated rental property operations (which is in accordance with GAAP) described in the above comparative discussions (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Our share of same store revenues $ 890,441 $ 897,271 $ 931,966 Our share of same store expenses 402,152 381,052 342,792 Our share of same store net operating income 488,289 516,219 589,174 Adjustments to reconcile same store net operating income to real estate segment net operating income(1) 244,557 235,111 134,255 Real estate segment net operating income $ 732,846 $ 751,330 $ 723,429 Same store statistics for three year period: Properties 499 499 499 Apartment units 139,102 139,102 139,102 Average physical occupancy 90.1 % 91.7 % 92.6 % Average rent /unit/month $ 685 $ 686 $ 705 (1) Includes: (i) minority partners share of consolidated, less our share of unconsolidated, property revenues and property operating expenses (at current period ownership); (ii) property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition and redevelopment properties); and (iii) eliminations and other adjustments made in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, our share of same store net operating income decreased $27.9 million, or 5.4%. Revenues decreased $6.8 million, or 0.8%, primarily due to lower occupancy (down 1.6%), and slightly lower average rent (down $1 per unit), offset by higher utility reimbursements from residents and lower bad debt expense. Expenses increased by $21.1 million, or 5.5%, primarily due to: an increase of $18.9 million in compensation and benefit expense related to a new employee health plan, merit increases and increased staffing levels; an increase of $3.7 million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas; and an increase of $3.9 million in marketing and administrative expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property taxes related to successful appeals and changes in estimates related to assessments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, our share of same store net operating income decreased $73.0 million, or 12.4%. Revenues decreased $34.7 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to lower average rent (down $19 per unit), lower occupancy (down 0.9%), and increased bad debt. Expenses increased by $38.3 million, or 11.2%, primarily due to: an increase of $10.1 million in turnover, marketing and administrative costs in 2003 related to focused efforts to improve property appearance and the condition of units ready to be occupied; $9.6 million in contract services and repairs and maintenance primarily driven by seasonal factors such as landscaping and snow removal due to more severe winter conditions in 2003 than in 2002; $6.0 million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas, electric, water and sewer; and $4.8 million in property hazard insurance due to increased casualty losses. Property Management We earn income from property management primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner. The income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities. Our revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships and the income generated is therefore eliminated in consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by GAAP. Additionally, our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold. Offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management. 25 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Property management revenues, primarily from affiliates $ 32,461 $ 37,992 $ 56,550 Property management expenses 9,199 8,106 7,340 Net operating income from property management $ 23,262 $ 29,886 $ 49,210 For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from property management decreased by $6.6 million, or 22.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, net operating income from property management decreased by $19.3 million, or 39.3%. In both periods the decreases were principally due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships, which required elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships, and the sales of properties within our unconsolidated partnerships (53 properties in 2004 and 37 properties in 2003) that had previously generated property management revenues. Activity Fees and Asset Management Activity fees are generated from transactional activity including dispositions, syndications, tax credit redevelopments and refinancings. These transactions occur on varying timetables, thus the income generated may vary from period to period. The majority of these fees are generated by transactions related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. Asset management revenue is from the financial management of properties, rather than management of day to day property operations. Asset management revenue includes deferred asset management fees that are recognized once a transaction or improvement in operations has occurred to generate available cash. Offsetting the revenue earned in activity fees and asset management are the direct expenses associated with these activities. The following table summarizes the overall performance of our activity fees and asset management for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates $ 34,801 $ 20,198 $ 21,622 Activity and asset management expenses 11,802 8,367 9,747 Net operating income from activity fees and asset management $ 22,999 $ 11,831 $ 11,875 Included in the activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were $30.3 million, $18.9 million and $19.7 million, respectively, of fees related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by $11.2 million, or 94.4%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to disposition, refinancing and developer activities of $7.3 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, due to a greater number of transactions in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.9 million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from closed transactions and improved operations. These increases were offset by a $2.1 million decrease related to syndication fees and $3.4 million in higher expenses associated with these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, net operating income from activity fees and asset management decreased by $0.04 million. This overall decrease was principally a result of decreased activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities of $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, due to a fewer number of transactions in 2003 than in 2002. Additionally, there was a decrease of $3.5 million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from fewer closed 26 Table of Contents transactions in 2003. These decreases were offset by a $6.6 million increase related to syndication fees and lower expenses of $1.4 million associated with these activities. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased $37.2 million, or 11.2%. This increase was principally due to $11.3 million and $7.2 million of additional depreciation related to the newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively, as well as $10.5 million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties. Additionally, $7.1 million of the increase resulted from additional depreciation on certain assets where, based on a periodic review, the estimated useful lives were reduced. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization increased $63.5 million, or 23.7%. This increase was principally due to $23.4 million and $23.5 million of additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties, respectively, as well as $12.3 million of additional depreciation related to new capital spending on same store properties. Additionally, amortization of intangibles increased $2.7 million as a result of additional amortization recognized due to the termination of certain management contracts acquired in the Casden Transactions. General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, general and administrative expenses increased $29.4 million, or 60.5%. This increase was principally due to: $15.5 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, merit increases and variable compensation; $7.7 million related to increased health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in 2003 related to our accrual for insurance claims incurred but not reported (IBNR); $3.2 million in increased amortization of restricted stock and stock option compensation; and $3.1 million in legal costs and compliance costs primarily related to the internal control reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat decreasing $0.4 million, or 0.8%. This decrease was principally due to: $6.0 million related to lower health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in our IBNR accrual in 2003; and $2.9 million in lower salaries, primarily related to lower variable compensation. These decreases were offset by an $8.7 million increase in consulting fees associated with the implementation of site level software and legal fees. Other Expenses (Income), Net Other expenses (income), net includes tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, other expenses (income), net changed $9.7 million from income of $6.3 million in 2003 to expense of $3.4 million in 2004. This change was principally due to a $10.8 million lower tax benefit recognized in 2004 as compared to 2003, due primarily to an $8.0 million benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance (see further discussion in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). In the year ended December 31, 2004, there was a tax benefit of $7.2 million recorded, as compared to $18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, other expenses (income), net changed $8.3 million from expense of $2.0 million in 2002 to income of $6.3 million in 2003. This change was principally due to a $15.1 million higher tax benefit recognized in 2003 as compared to 2002, partially offset by $2.4 million in higher franchise taxes and $1.3 million in decreased risk operations due to increased legal expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2003, there was a tax benefit of $18.0 million recorded, as compared to $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. See discussion above on the 2003 tax activity. 27 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest and accretion on general partner notes receivable from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income increased $7.6 million, or 30.8%. This increase was principally a result of $5.0 million in higher interest due from general partner notes receivable, and $3.0 million in higher accretion income. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased $51.6 million, or 67.5%. This decrease was principally a result of: $33.5 million in reduced accretion income; $11.1 million in lower interest due from general partner notes receivable resulting from the consolidation of real estate partnerships, and therefore the elimination of interest income, as well as the collection of outstanding notes receivable; and $7.7 million related to gain recognized in second quarter 2002 on the sale of certain tax exempt bonds. Recovery of (Provision for) Losses on Notes Receivable For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, recovery of (provision for) losses on notes receivable changed $3.9 million from a provision of $2.2 million in 2003 to a recovery of $1.8 million in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, provision for losses on notes receivable decreased $6.8 million. The provision or recovery in each period was determined based on our periodic review of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio as well as actual cash collections. We continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis and record provisions as necessary based on the projected operating cash flows of the underlying real estate assets. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $24.8 million, or 7.3%. This increase was principally due to: $9.9 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to the newly consolidated properties; $9.6 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition properties; and a $4.7 million decrease in capitalized interest due to redevelopment properties being placed in service. Additionally, an $8.8 million increase related to the credit facility and term loan (of which $1.8 million was associated with the write off of deferred loan costs related to the November 2004 modification of the credit facility and term loan and $0.8 million related to the payoff of the indebtedness incurred to complete the Casden Transactions) due to higher average principal balances along with a higher weighted average interest rate. The November 2004 modification reduced the spread over LIBOR by an average of 1.25%, which will favorably impact interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and $300 million term loan. These increases were partially offset by lower weighted average effective interest rates on mortgage debt due to refinancings that occurred in 2003 and 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense increased $47.0 million, or 16.0%. This increase was principally due to $26.6 million and $21.3 million of additional interest on the debt related to the newly consolidated properties and the acquisition properties, respectively. Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the amount of such distribution, even though there is no economic effect or cost. 28 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $4.6 million, or 20.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $4.9 million, or 17.8%. Each of these decreases were due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity and decreased operating results, as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships decreased $4.7 million, or 72.5%. This decrease in loss was principally the result of increased ownership in certain unconsolidated partnerships and better property operating results at certain properties. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships changed $7.1 million from equity in earnings of $0.7 million in 2002 to equity in losses of $6.4 million in 2003. This increase was principally the result of the purchase of equity interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that resulted in these properties becoming consolidated. Such real estate partnerships owned better performing properties that are now contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses. In addition, the remaining properties within unconsolidated real estate partnerships had decreased earnings driven by lower property operating results in 2003 than in 2002. Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate Related to Unconsolidated Entities and Other Gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of gain related to dispositions of real estate within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities. Gains (losses) on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased $65.5 million. This increase was principally due to a $34.6 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in Florida, and $17.4 million gain from the sale of one of our unconsolidated core properties. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased $25.5 million. Included in 2002 was a loss of approximately $28.0 million that resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold. The recognition of this amount in 2002 was considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties. The recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed $17.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed $13.5 million. The changes in both periods were principally a result of decreased earnings caused by lower property operating results than in the prior year. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net For properties accounted for as held for sale, the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property 29 Table of Contents related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale, and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported as discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $211.8 million, $94.7 million and $20.4 million, respectively, which includes income from operations of $6.6 million, $15.4 million and $35.6 million, respectively. In 2004, the income from operations included 68 properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during 2004. In 2003 and 2002, the income from operations included 140 properties and 182 properties, respectively, that were sold or classified as held for sale in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales, the income from operations is not comparable year to year. During 2004, we sold 54 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $233.9 million (which is net of $16.0 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $7.3 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2004. During 2003, we sold 72 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $89.7 million (which is net of $12.1 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $9.0 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2003. During 2002, we sold 42 properties, resulting in a net loss on sale of approximately $8.5 million (including $2.5 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $2.9 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2002. Gains (losses) on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable period to period. See Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more details on discontinued operations. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle On March 31, 2004, we recorded a $4.0 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 46. This charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; 30 Table of Contents increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate, goodwill and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, we have determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used is recoverable and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of subordinated notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes, and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. For the year ended December 31, 2004, if we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have decreased by $6.3 million ($0.06 per basic and diluted share). Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $1.8 million in net recovery of impairment losses on notes receivable. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we identified and recorded 31 Table of Contents $2.2 million, and $9.0 million in impairment losses on notes receivable (net of recoveries), respectively. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we may adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize direct and allocable indirect costs (including salaries, interest, real estate taxes and other costs) incurred in connection with redevelopment, Capital Improvement and Capital Replacement activities. We charge to expense as incurred indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities, including general and administrative expenses. The amounts capitalized depend on the volume and costs of such activities. Based on the level of capital spending during the year ended December 31, 2004, if capital activities had increased or decreased during the period by 10%, our income before minority interest would have increased or decreased, respectively, by approximately $5.1 million. See further discussion under the heading Capital Expenditures. Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002 White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock, adding back dividends/ distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 32 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our FFO is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Net income attributable to common stockholders(1) $ 174,693 $ 65,292 $ 75,488 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization(2) 368,844 331,609 268,085 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (18,349 ) (20,370 ) (19,070 ) Depreciation on rental property related to minority partners interest(3) (43,387 ) (28,714 ) (22,542 ) Depreciation on rental property related to unconsolidated entities 22,360 25,817 33,549 (Gain) loss on disposition of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other (68,634 ) (3,178 ) 22,362 Gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets 38,977 Deficit distributions to minority partners, net(4) 18,007 22,629 27,535 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 3,957 Discontinued operations: Depreciation on rental property, net of minority partners interest(3) 12,404 37,349 48,458 (Gain) loss on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest(3) (249,944 ) (101,849 ) 6,021 (Recovery of deficit distributions) deficit distributions to minority partners(4) (3,863 ) (10,686 ) 765 Income tax arising from disposals 16,015 12,134 2,507 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (10,289 ) (29,910 ) (44,500 ) Preferred stock dividends 85,315 85,920 93,558 Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs 3,489 7,645 Funds From Operations $ 349,595 $ 393,688 $ 492,216 Preferred stock dividends (85,315 ) (85,920 ) (93,558 ) Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs (3,489 ) (7,645 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 2,798 11,330 38,091 Interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 987 1,161 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 263,589 $ 312,440 $ 437,910 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding: Common shares and equivalents(5) 93,252 92,968 86,773 Dilutive preferred securities 1,106 3,639 9,588 Total 94,358 96,607 96,361 Notes: (1) Represents our numerator for earnings per common share calculated in accordance with GAAP. (2) Includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts 33 Table of Contents depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, we believe it is consistent with the White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry. (3) Minority partners interest, means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (4) In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners capital account, which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet. We record these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or (b) a cost related to the non controlling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. (5) Represents our denominator for earnings per common share diluted calculated in accordance with GAAP plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that the cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2004, we had $105.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $9.1 million from December 31, 2003, which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). At December 31, 2004, we had $282.0 million of restricted cash (including $12.6 million of restricted cash that is included within Assets Held for Sale), primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net cash provided by operating activities of $365.5 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is determined by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. This decreased $98.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2003, driven primarily by lower property operating results. 34 Table of Contents Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net cash provided by investing activities of $336.9 million primarily resulted from proceeds received from sales of properties, offset by the acquisition of The Palazzo at Park La Brea and several other properties (see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on acquisitions), as well as investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending (see further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading Capital Expenditures). Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold 54 consolidated properties, three consolidated land parcels, and 53 unconsolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $1.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion related to the consolidated properties and land parcels. The sale of the consolidated properties generated proceeds totaling $971.6 million, after the payment of transaction costs. Our share of the total net proceeds from the sale of the 107 properties and three land parcels, after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $530.3 million, of which $60.9 million related to the unconsolidated properties. Of the $60.9 million, $39.0 million was received as of December 31, 2004, and was included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness, redeem preferred securities, and for other corporate purposes. We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long term investment strategy but offer attractive returns, such as sales to buyers who intend to convert the properties to condominiums. Gross sales proceeds from 2005 dispositions are expected to be $500 million to $550 million, and we plan to use such proceeds to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used in financing activities of $711.5 million primarily related to payments on our secured notes payable, the repayment in full of the term loan we entered into in connection with the Casden Transactions, payment of our dividends, and the full or partial redemptions of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, the Class P Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock and the Class N Cumulative Preferred Stock. These were offset by proceeds from the issuance of Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class V Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock and mortgage loans (see notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details on these activities). Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2004, we had $5.6 billion in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding as compared to $5.2 billion outstanding at December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 38 consolidated properties generating $444.3 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 4.03%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $120.2 million. In addition, we closed mortgage loans on 22 unconsolidated properties, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%. Our share of the net proceeds from these 22 mortgage loans totaled $26.2 million and are included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships within investing activities. We used our total net proceeds from all loans closed of $146.4 million to repay existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes. In 2005, we intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we closed five mortgage loans totaling $126.8 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.40%, to finance our acquisitions. 35 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans On November 2, 2004, we entered into an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement, with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Credit Agreement replaced our previous two separate credit agreements. The original aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement is $750 million, comprised of $450 million of revolving loan commitments and a $300 million term loan tranche. Proceeds from the term loan made on the closing date were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our previous loan facilities and for other corporate purposes. Proceeds from the revolving loans made on the closing date were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the previous loan facilities. The term loan matures on November 2, 2009 and the revolving loans mature on November 2, 2007. See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for detailed information on the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal balance of the term loan was $300.0 million at an interest rate of 4.18% (based on LIBOR plus 2.00%). The proceeds of future term loans are generally permitted to be used to fund general working capital and other corporate purposes. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans was $68.7 million at an interest rate of 4.64% (based on various weighted average LIBOR and base rate borrowings outstanding with various maturities). The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004 was $358.2 million (after giving effect to $23.1 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of future revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. Additionally, during 2004, we repaid $104.4 million of indebtedness that was incurred in connection with the Casden Transactions. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2004, we issued $522.5 million of new preferred securities with rates ranging from 7.75% to 8.5%. With proceeds from these issuances, we redeemed or exchanged $336.2 million of outstanding preferred securities with rates ranging from 8.75% to 9.00%. Additionally, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Class S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $98.9 million (see Notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Under our shelf registration, which was declared effective in April 2004, we had approximately $877 million of debt and equity securities available and the Aimco Operating Partnership had $500 million of debt available as of December 31, 2004 (see Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details on the shelf registration statement and preferred securities). We intend to continue to issue preferred securities in both public offerings and private placements to generate proceeds that we will use to redeem higher cost preferred securities, to finance acquisitions of real estate interests and for other corporate purposes. Our Board of Directors has, from time to time and most recently in 2001, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately 1.5 million shares of either our Common Stock or preferred stock. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. On February 18, 19 and 24, 2004, we purchased in the open market 30,000, 60,000 and 20,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at an average price per share of approximately $32.03, $32.17 and $31.26, respectively. Additionally, on February 24, 2004, we completed the purchase of 287,272 shares of Common Stock at a price of $31.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. The dividend paid in February 2005 of $0.60 per share represents a distribution of 120% of diluted Adjusted Funds From Operations, which we refer to as AFFO, and 83% of diluted FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. 36 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Effective January 1, 2004, we classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI) or redevelopment. We believe the new classifications are simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding our capital spending. Non redevelopment capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents CI). For the year ended December 31, 2004, we spent a total of $77.2 million on CR. These are expenditures that represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we spent a total of $82.4 million and $88.8 million, respectively, on CI and redevelopment. CI expenditures represent all non redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition, and redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. 37 Table of Contents The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2004 on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 160,000 ownership equivalent units), and reconciles it to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Actual Cost Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Detail: Building interiors $ 14,839 $ 93 Includes: hot water heaters, kitchen/bath Building exteriors 12,011 75 Includes: roofs, exterior painting, electrical, plumbing Landscaping and grounds 7,928 50 Includes: parking lot improvements, pool improvements Turnover related 29,311 183 Includes: carpet, vinyl, tile, appliance, and fixture replacements Capitalized payroll and other indirect costs 13,152 82 Total our share of Capital Replacements $ 77,241 $ 483 Capital Replacements: Conventional $ 67,491 Affordable 9,750 Total our share of Capital Replacements 77,241 Capital Improvements: Conventional 62,339 Affordable 20,030 Total our share of Capital Improvements 82,369 Redevelopment: Conventional 75,259 Affordable 13,550 Total our share of redevelopment 88,809 Total our share of capital expenditures 248,419 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 68,027 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (14,509 ) Total capital expenditures per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 301,937 Included in the above spending for CI and redevelopment, is approximately $26.6 million of our share of capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2004. We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital, and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands): Less than More than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 5,604,653 $ 254,840 $ 1,006,250 $ 600,811 $ 3,742,752 Secured credit facility and term loans 368,700 68,700 300,000 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities(1) 15,019 15,019 Redevelopment and other construction commitments 72,706 69,943 2,254 509 Commitments to purchase real estate(2) 485,500 485,500 Leases for space occupied 46,926 7,262 14,292 11,337 14,035 Development fee payments(3) 22,500 10,000 12,500 Total $ 6,616,004 $ 827,545 $ 1,103,996 $ 912,657 $ 3,771,806 (1) Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were fully redeemed on January 11, 2005 (see Note 22 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information). (2) Of the $485.5 million total: $201 million was associated with our commitment to purchase Westwood (a commitment entered into in connection with the Casden Transactions), which commitment was extinguished on January 3, 2005; and $199 million was associated with our commitment to acquire the Palazzo East at Park La Brea (a commitment entered into in connection with the Casden Transactions), which transaction was completed on February 28, 2005. As a result, as of February 28, 2005 the total remaining commitment to purchase real estate is $85.5 million. See Notes 9 and 22 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. (3) The development fee payments above were established in connection with the Casden Transactions and our commitment as it relates to the Casden Development Company, LLC. We agreed to pay $2.5 million per quarter for five years (up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million) to Casden Development Company, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services on our assets. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financings and operating cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which interests were acquired through portfolio acquisitions, individual property purchases and separate offers to other limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships ranges typically from less than 1% to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements, which grant varying degrees of control, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes. The requirement or ability to consolidate a real estate partnership is determined by FIN 46 (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees (see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 39 Table of Contents of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We had $1,533.2 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. Of the total floating rate debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($741.8 million), floating rate secured notes ($422.7 million), revolving loans ($68.7 million), and the term loan ($300.0 million). Based on this level of debt, an increase in interest rates of 1% would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $15.3 million on an annual basis. Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the BMA Index, which since 1981 has averaged 52.1% of the 10 year Treasury Yield. If this relationship continues, an increase in the 10 year Treasury Yield, of 1% (0.52% in tax exempt interest rates) would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $11.8 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2004, we had $4,455.2 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, based on our level of floating rate debt of $1,599.0 million, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have resulted in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $16.0 million on an annual basis. The potential reduction of income before minority interests and cash flows due to an increase in interest rates decreased $0.7 million for 2004 compared to 2003 due to lower floating rate balances resulting from the redemption of Class S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and repayment of a portion of the term loan. We believe that the fair value of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of December 31, 2004 approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements were estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues. The combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at December 31, 2004 was $4.4 billion compared to the computed fair value of $4.8 billion (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). As of December 31, 2004, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds were as follows (dollars in thousands): Amortization Maturities Total Percentage 2005 $ 128,720 $ 126,120 $ 254,840 4.5 % 2006 133,238 495,054 628,292 11.2 2007 140,490 237,468 377,958 6.7 2008 145,163 178,215 323,378 5.8 2009 152,794 124,639 277,433 5.0 Thereafter 3,742,752 66.8 $ 5,604,653 100.0 %
