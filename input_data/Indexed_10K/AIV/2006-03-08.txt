Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or managed 1,370 apartment properties containing 240,484 units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Funds From Operations, or FFO; FFO less spending for Capital Replacements, or AFFO; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements, or Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. These terms are defined and described in the sections captioned Funds From Operations and Capital Expenditures below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; and interest rates. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties, the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties, and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. Our focus in 2005 has been to increase revenue and implement cost management and productivity initiatives, which includes centralizing purchasing, restructuring business processes, using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending. We believe that our efforts are having their intended effect, are resulting in a positive trend in certain operating results and are the foundation for improved long term operating results. These initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality, and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions. For 2006, our focus will include the following: continue to improve operations so that customer satisfaction and occupancy increase to bring improved profitability; upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management and redevelopment; increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation; improve balance sheet flexibility; minimize our cost of capital in the face of rising interest rates; and monetize a portion of the value inherent in our properties with increased entitlements. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements. Results of Operations Overview 2005 compared to 2004 We reported net income of $71.0 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreases of $192.5 million and $191.7 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to lower net gains on dispositions of real estate; a decrease in net gain on disposition of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other, primarily related to a 2004 gain on sale of land; 20 Table of Contents an increase in depreciation and amortization expense; an increase in interest expense; and an increase in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, which included increases related to acquisition, newly consolidated and same store properties. 2004 compared to 2003 We reported net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to net income of $158.9 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, increases of $104.6 million and $109.4 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate (including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain related to unconsolidated entities and other); and an increase in activity fees and asset management revenues. These increases were partially offset by: an overall decline in net operating income, which included a decline in same store net operating results, partially offset by increases related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties; an increase in general and administrative expenses; an increase in interest expense; and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Rental Property Operations Our operating income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties. The principal components within our total consolidated property operations are: consolidated same store properties, which consist of all conventional properties that were owned (and not classified as held for sale) and managed by us, stabilized and consolidated for all comparable periods presented; and other consolidated entities, which primarily include acquisition, newly consolidated, affordable and redevelopment properties. The following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Rental and other property revenues $ 1,459,646 $ 1,308,815 $ 1,249,716 Property operating expenses 705,505 632,512 553,482 Net operating income $ 754,141 $ 676,303 $ 696,234 For the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $77.8 million, or 11.5%. This increase was principally due to a $39.3 million increase in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results); a $21.3 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of Palazzo East at Park La Brea and five other properties purchased in 2005 and The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004; an $18.0 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties, which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method 21 Table of Contents (21 properties first consolidated in 2005 and 42 properties first consolidated in 2004, which includes 24 properties that were consolidated due to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or FIN 46,); a $3.9 million increase related to operations of our affordable properties; and a $2.7 million increase related to the completion of certain redevelopment properties. These increases were offset by $6.4 million of increased property management expenses and $3.3 million of higher net casualty losses in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily relating to greater hurricane and tropical storm damage that occurred in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income for our consolidated property operations decreased by $19.9 million, or 2.9%. This decrease was principally due to a $40.3 million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results). Additionally, there was a $6.6 million decrease related to net casualty losses and other costs primarily resulting from hurricanes and tropical storms in the third quarter of 2004, which damaged over 100 of our properties and $4.0 million in higher property management expenses. These decreases were offset by an $18.2 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties, which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method (42 properties first consolidated in 2004 and 12 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2003) and a $16.0 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004, and three properties purchased in 2003. Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define same store properties as conventional properties (i) that we manage, (ii) in which our ownership interest exceeds 10%, (iii) the operations of which have been stabilized for all periods presented and (iv) that have not been classified as held for sale. Our share reflects Aimcos ownership share before minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on our ownership in the most current period presented in each table. The following tables summarize the conventional rental property operations on a same store basis (which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) and reconcile them to consolidated rental property operations (which is in accordance with GAAP) described in the above comparative discussions (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change Our share of same store revenues $ 999,383 $ 941,731 6.1 % Less: Our share of same store expenses 443,112 418,221 6.0 % Our share of same store net operating income 556,271 523,510 6.3 % Adjustments to reconcile same store net operating income to real estate segment net operating income(1) 197,870 152,793 29.5 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 754,141 $ 676,303 11.5 % Same store statistics: Properties 458 458 Apartment units 131,491 131,491 Average physical occupancy 92.2 % 89.3 % 2.9 % Average rent/unit/month $ 762 $ 746 2.1 % (1) Includes: (i) minority partners share of consolidated, less our share of unconsolidated, property revenues and property operating expenses (at 2005 ownership); (ii) property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition and 22 Table of Contents redevelopment properties); and (iii) eliminations and other adjustments and reclassifications made in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, our share of same store net operating income increased $32.8 million, or 6.3%. Revenues increased $57.7 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to higher occupancy (up 2.9%), higher average rent (up $16 per unit) and lower bad debt. Expenses increased by $24.9 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to: an increase of $9.1 million in compensation expense related to increased staffing levels to support our initiatives to improve customer service; a $7.2 million increase in utilities due primarily to higher natural gas rates; a $5.5 million increase in real estate taxes; and $2.4 million of increases primarily related to turnover expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Change Our share of same store revenues $ 1,005,095 $ 1,011,323 (0.6 )% Less: Our share of same store expenses 441,413 417,281 5.8 % Our share of same store net operating income 563,682 594,042 (5.1 )% Adjustments to reconcile same store net operating income to real estate segment net operating income(1) 112,621 102,192 10.2 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 676,303 $ 696,234 (2.9 )% Same store statistics: Properties 524 524 Apartment units 147,070 147,070 Average physical occupancy 90.3 % 91.9 % (1.6 )% Average rent/unit/month $ 721 $ 721 (1) Includes: (i) minority partners share of consolidated, less our share of unconsolidated, property revenues and property operating expenses (at 2004 ownership); (ii) property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition and redevelopment properties); and (iii) eliminations and other adjustments and reclassifications made in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, our share of same store net operating income decreased $30.4 million, or 5.1%. Revenues decreased $6.2 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to lower occupancy (down 1.6%), offset by higher utility reimbursements from residents and lower bad debt expense. Expenses increased by $24.1 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to: an increase of $20.0 million in compensation and benefit expense related to a new employee health plan, merit increases and increased staffing levels; an increase of $4.3 million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas; and an increase of $3.9 million in marketing and administrative expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property taxes related to successful appeals and changes in estimates related to assessments. Property Management We earn income from property management primarily from certain unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner. The income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities. Reported revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships because it is eliminated in consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by GAAP. Additionally, our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold. Offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management. 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Property management revenues, primarily from affiliates $ 24,528 $ 32,461 $ 37,992 Property management expenses 7,292 9,789 8,419 Net operating income from property management $ 17,236 $ 22,672 $ 29,573 For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from property management decreased by $5.4 million, or 24.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from property management decreased by $6.9 million, or 23.3%. In both periods the decreases were principally due to an increase in the number of consolidated real estate partnerships (resulting from increased ownership and GAAP consolidation requirements), which required elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships and the sales of properties within our unconsolidated partnerships (35 properties in 2005, 53 properties in 2004 and 37 properties in 2003) that had previously generated property management revenues. Activity Fees and Asset Management Activity fees are generated from transactional activity including tax credit syndications and redevelopments, dispositions, and refinancings. These transactions occur on varying timetables, thus the income varies from period to period. The majority of these fees are earned in connection with transactions related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. We have a large number of affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities. As a result, we view activity fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy. Asset management revenue is from the financial management of partnerships, rather than management of day to day property operations. Asset management revenue includes deferred asset management fees that are recognized once a transaction or improvement in operations has occurred thereby generating available cash. Activity and asset management expenses are the direct expenses associated with transactional activities and asset management. The following table summarizes the operating results of our transactional and asset management activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates $ 37,349 $ 34,801 $ 20,198 Activity and asset management expenses 10,606 11,802 8,367 Net operating income from activity fees and asset management $ 26,743 $ 22,999 $ 11,831 Included in the activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were $33.3 million, $30.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively, of fees related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased $3.7 million, or 16.3%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to syndication and developer activities of $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as well as a $1.2 million decrease in expenses associated with these activities. Additionally, we received $3.1 million in promote distributions from an unconsolidated partnership, as a result of us, as general partner, achieving financial returns to the limited partners in excess of established targets. These increases were offset by a $5.2 million decrease in asset management fees and decreases of $3.3 million and $1.9 million in activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities, respectively. 24 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by $11.2 million, or 94.4%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to disposition, refinancing and developer activities of $7.3 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, due to a greater number of transactions in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.9 million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from closed transactions and improved operations. These increases were offset by a $2.1 million decrease in syndication fees and $3.4 million in higher expenses associated with these activities. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $71.5 million, or 21.0%. This increase was principally due to: $34.6 million of additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively (see Impairment of Long Lived Assets in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8); $13.8 million and $8.3 million of additional depreciation related to newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively; and $11.0 million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties. Additionally, $4.3 million of the increase was due to a change in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased $32.5 million, or 10.5%. This increase was principally due to $8.5 million and $7.2 million of additional depreciation related to the newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively, as well as $9.9 million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties. Additionally, $5.9 million of the increase resulted from additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively (see Impairment of Long Lived Assets in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, general and administrative expenses increased $15.4 million, or 19.9%. This increase was principally due to $14.1 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, increased health care costs, and transition costs associated with the chief financial and chief accounting officer positions. Additionally, at the end of 2005 there was $0.6 million in severance costs related to the restructuring of regional operating centers as a result of property dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, general and administrative expenses increased $29.1 million, or 60.3%. This increase was principally due to: $15.5 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, merit increases and variable compensation; $7.7 million related to increased health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in 2003 related to our accrual for insurance claims incurred but not reported (IBNR); $3.2 million in increased amortization of restricted stock and stock option compensation; and $3.1 million in legal costs and compliance costs primarily related to the internal control reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Other Expenses (Income), Net Other expenses (income), net includes income tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, other expenses (income), net changed $8.2 million from expense of $1.9 million in 2004 to income of $6.3 million in 2005. This change was principally due to an $11.4 million higher income tax benefit recognized in 2005 as compared to 2004, reflecting increased losses of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (see further discussion in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). In the year ended December 31, 2005, there was a tax benefit of $18.6 million recorded, as compared to $7.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, we had higher income associated with our risk management activities, primarily due to better workers compensation 25 Table of Contents claim experience as a result of more focused loss prevention measures. These increases in other income were partially offset by $3.8 million of higher partnership expenses primarily related to increases in professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, other expenses (income), net changed $8.9 million from income of $7.0 million in 2003 to expense of $1.9 million in 2004. This change was principally due to a $10.8 million lower income tax benefit recognized in 2004 as compared to 2003, due primarily to an $8.0 million benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in 2003 (see further discussion in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). In the year ended December 31, 2004, there was a tax benefit of $7.2 million recorded, as compared to $18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest and accretion on general partner notes receivable from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest income decreased $0.9 million, or 2.7%. This decrease was principally a result of $3.8 million in lower accretion income, partially offset by higher interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts due to increased interest rates and higher cash balances. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income increased $7.6 million, or 30.9%. This increase was principally a result of $5.0 million in higher interest due from general partner notes receivable, and $3.0 million in higher accretion income. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $25.8 million, or 7.5%. This increase was principally due to: $16.0 million and $5.0 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties, respectively; $17.7 million due to increased borrowings and increased interest rates on corporate and variable rate property debt and other items. These increases were partially offset by: $4.8 million in lower amortization of loan costs, primarily due to corporate debt restructuring in 2004; $8.5 million in higher capitalized interest due to increased redevelopment activity; and a $2.1 million decrease related to the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 2004 and early 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense increased $24.8 million, or 7.8%. This increase was principally due to: $9.9 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to the newly consolidated properties; $9.6 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition properties; and a $4.7 million decrease in capitalized interest due to redevelopment properties being placed in service. Additionally, an $8.8 million increase related to the credit facility and term loan (of which $1.8 million was associated with the write off of deferred loan costs related to the November 2004 modification of the credit facility and term loan and $0.8 million related to the payoff of the indebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc) due to higher average principal balances along with a higher weighted average interest rate. The November 2004 modification reduced the spread over LIBOR by an average of 1.25%, which has favorably impacted interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and $300 million term loan. These increases were partially offset by lower weighted average effective interest rates on mortgage debt due to refinancings that occurred in 2003 and 2004. Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the amount of such distribution, even though there is no economic effect or cost. 26 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $5.9 million, or 33.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $2.4 million, or 11.6%. The decrease in both periods was due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity and decreased operating results, as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships. Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate Related to Unconsolidated Entities and Other Gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of gain related to dispositions of real estate within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gain on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other decreased $52.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased $66.1 million. The change in both periods was principally due to a $34.6 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in Florida and a $17.4 million gain from the sale of one of our unconsolidated core properties, both of which occurred in 2004. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This includes the minority partners share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, such minority interests had a favorable effect on our consolidated operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased $10.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships increased $16.6 million. The change in both periods was driven by property operating results. During 2005 as compared to 2004 our property operating results improved, thereby reducing the benefit from minority interest. When comparing 2004 to 2003 our property operating results declined, thereby increasing the benefit from minority interest. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net For properties accounted for as held for sale, the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further policy information). The property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale, and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported as discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $98.9 million, $213.5 million and $97.2 million, respectively, which includes a loss from operations of $2.0 million in 2005 and income from operations of $9.2 million and $21.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the income from operations included the operating results of 91 properties and one 27 Table of Contents partnership that were sold or classified as held for sale during 2005. In 2004 and 2003, the income from operations included the operating results of 145 properties and one partnership and 217 properties and one partnership, respectively, that were sold or classified as held for sale in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales, the income from operations is not comparable year to year. During 2005, we sold 83 properties and one partnership, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $100.9 million (which is net of $4.5 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $3.8 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2005 and $14.9 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2004, we sold 54 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $233.4 million (which is net of $16.0 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $7.3 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2004 and $3.7 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2003, we sold 72 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $89.7 million (which is net of $12.1 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $9.0 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2003 and $8.3 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. See Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more details on discontinued operations. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle On March 31, 2004, we recorded a $4.0 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 46. This charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; 28 Table of Contents changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded impairment losses of $3.4 million related to properties to be held and used. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used was recoverable and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes, and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. For the year ended December 31, 2005, if we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have been lower by $2.5 million. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $1.4 million and $1.8 million in net recovery of impairment losses on notes receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we identified and recorded $2.2 million in net impairment losses on notes receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility 29 Table of Contents of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. Costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed $250. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses. See Note 2 Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further policy information. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $18.1 million, $9.5 million and $14.5 million of interest costs, respectively, and $53.3 million, $46.7 million and $45.4 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002 White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 30 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders(1) $ (16,966 ) $ 174,693 $ 65,292 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization(2) 412,075 340,536 308,080 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (17,700 ) (18,349 ) (20,370 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners interest(3) (37,389 ) (40,581 ) (23,626 ) Depreciation of rental property related to unconsolidated entities 20,661 22,360 25,817 Gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other (16,489 ) (69,241 ) (3,178 ) Gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets 2,481 38,977 Deficit distributions to minority partners(4) 11,952 17,865 20,216 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 3,957 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest(3) (105,417 ) (249,376 ) (101,849 ) Depreciation of rental property, net of minority partners interest(3) 20,280 37,946 55,790 Recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners, net(4) (14,941 ) (3,722 ) (8,273 ) Income tax arising from disposals 4,481 16,015 12,134 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (28,381 ) (10,289 ) (29,910 ) Preferred stock dividends 86,825 85,315 85,920 Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs 1,123 3,489 7,645 Funds From Operations $ 322,595 $ 349,595 $ 393,688 Preferred stock dividends (86,825 ) (85,315 ) (85,920 ) Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs (1,123 ) (3,489 ) (7,645 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 168 2,798 11,330 Interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 987 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 234,815 $ 263,589 $ 312,440 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding: Common shares and equivalents(5) 94,465 93,252 92,968 Dilutive preferred securities 74 1,106 3,639 Total 94,539 94,358 96,607 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for earnings per common share, calculated in accordance with GAAP. (2) Includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, we believe it is 31 Table of Contents consistent with the White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry. (3) Minority partners interest, means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (4) In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners capital account, which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet. We record these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or (b) a payment related to the non controlling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. (5) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that the cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2005, we had $161.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $56.4 million from December 31, 2004, which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). At December 31, 2005, we had $284.8 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net cash provided by operating activities of $355.5 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.0 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, driven by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to cash used to 32 Table of Contents reduce current liabilities related to interest and real estate tax accruals, offset by decreases in accounts receivable related to improved collections, and decreases in prepaid expense and restricted cash balances. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net cash used in investing activities of $50.0 million primarily resulted from investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending as well as the acquisition of Palazzo East at Park La Brea and five other properties (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on acquisitions), partially offset by proceeds received from sales of properties. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold 83 consolidated properties and 35 unconsolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $960.0 million, of which $764.0 million related to the consolidated properties. The sale of the consolidated properties generated proceeds totaling $718.4 million, after the payment of transaction costs. Our share of the total net proceeds from the sale of the 118 properties, after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $331.8 million, of which $36.4 million related to the unconsolidated properties and was included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Sales proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes. We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long term investment strategy but offer attractive returns, such as sales to buyers who intend to convert the properties to condominiums. Gross sales proceeds from 2006 dispositions are expected to be $750 million to $950 million, and we plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, redeem preferred securities and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. Capital Expenditures We classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties or redevelopment. Non redevelopment and non casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents CI). For the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent a total of $89.7 million on CR. These are expenditures that represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent a total of $112.0 million, $23.9 million and $140.3 million, respectively, on CI, casualties and redevelopment. CI expenditures represent all non redevelopment and non casualty capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. Casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. 33 Table of Contents The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2005 on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 150,200 ownership equivalent units (excluding non managed units) weighted for the portion of the period that we owned the property), and reconciles it to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Actual Cost Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Detail: Building interiors $ 14,453 $ 96 Includes: hot water heaters, kitchen/bath Building exteriors 13,932 93 Includes: roofs, exterior painting, electrical, plumbing Landscaping and grounds 7,509 50 Includes: parking lot improvements, pool improvements Turnover related 38,047 253 Includes: carpet, vinyl, tile, appliance, and fixture replacements Capitalized site payroll and indirect costs 15,719 105 Our share of Capital Replacements $ 89,660 $ 597 Capital Replacements: Conventional $ 83,197 Affordable 6,463 Our share of Capital Replacements 89,660 Capital Improvements: Conventional 91,228 Affordable 20,736 Our share of Capital Improvements 111,964 Casualties: Conventional 22,537 Affordable 1,380 Our share of casualties 23,917 Redevelopment: Conventional 137,311 Affordable 3,021 Our share of redevelopment 140,332 Our share of capital expenditures 365,873 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 90,113 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (12,104 ) Total capital expenditures per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 443,882 Included in the above spending for CI, casualties and redevelopment, was approximately $33.2 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2005. We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital, property sales and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 34 Table of Contents Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in financing activities of $249.2 million primarily related to payments on our secured notes payable, payment of our dividends, and redemptions of the Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock and Trust Based Convertible Preferred Securities, which we refer to as TOPRS, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $5.7 billion in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding, which included $33.7 million and $419.8 million, respectively, of mortgage debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 68 consolidated properties generating $591.1 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.02%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $254.1 million. In addition, we closed mortgage loans on 15 unconsolidated properties, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%. Our share of the net proceeds from these 15 mortgage loans totaled $26.4 million. We used our total net proceeds from all loans closed of $280.5 million for corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we closed five mortgage loans totaling $130.3 million, with an initial weighted average interest rate of 3.27%, to finance our consolidated acquisitions. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. On June 16, 2005, we amended our Credit Agreement, to provide for $100.0 million in additional term loan borrowings. The additional term loan matures on November 2, 2009 and bears interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus 1.75% or a base rate (determined by reference to the federal funds rate or Bank of Americas prime rate) plus 0.25%. The proceeds from the additional term loan were used to repay outstanding revolving loans. The aggregate amount of commitments and loans under the Credit Agreement is $850.0 million, comprised of $450.0 million of revolving loan commitments and $400.0 million in term loans. The term loans mature on November 2, 2009 and the revolving loans mature on November 2, 2007. At December 31, 2005, the term loans had an outstanding principal balance of $400.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.18% (based on LIBOR plus 2.00% for the original $300.0 million and LIBOR plus 1.75% for the additional $100.0 million). At December 31, 2005, the revolving loans had an outstanding principal balance of $217.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.26% (based on various weighted average LIBOR and base rate borrowings outstanding with various maturities). The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005 was $208.3 million (after giving effect to $24.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. For more information, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock for $31.3 million in cash. As of December 31, 2005, under our shelf registration statement, which was declared effective in April 2004, we had available for issuance approximately $877 million of debt and equity securities and the Aimco Operating Partnership had available for issuance $500 million of debt securities. From time to time we may issue preferred securities in both public offerings and private placements to generate proceeds to be used to redeem higher cost preferred securities, to finance acquisitions of real estate interests and for other corporate purposes. 35 Table of Contents Our Board of Directors has, from time to time authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. In April 2005, our Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to a total of eight million shares of our Common Stock. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During 2005, we did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock. Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (amounts in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total One Year Years Years 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 5,667,243 $ 541,445 $ 933,325 $ 599,105 $ 3,593,368 Secured credit facility and term loans 617,000 217,000 400,000 Long term liabilities related to assets held for sale 33,676 1,261 2,816 3,271 26,328 Redevelopment and other construction commitments 99,591 96,704 2,887 Leases for space occupied 43,743 7,784 14,663 9,925 11,371 Development fee payments(1) 12,500 10,000 2,500 Total $ 6,473,753 $ 657,194 $ 1,173,191 $ 1,012,301 $ 3,631,067 (1) The development fee payments above were established in connection with the acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc. and our commitment as it relates to the Casden Development Company, LLC. We agreed to pay $2.5 million per quarter for five years (up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million) to Casden Development Company, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services on our assets. In addition, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financings and operating cash flows. In 2006, we plan to invest between $150 and $200 million in conventional redevelopment projects that will impact approximately 70 properties with nearly 30,000 units. Additionally, in 2006 redevelopment expenditures on affordable properties will be approximately $80 million, predominantly funded by third party tax credit equity, impacting 20 to 25 properties with more than 3,000 units. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than 1% up to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes 36 Table of Contents receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We had $2,010.6 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 including debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. Of the total floating rate debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($726.1 million), floating rate secured notes ($667.5 million), revolving loans ($217.0 million), and term loans ($400.0 million). Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the BMA Index, which since 1981 has averaged 68.0% of 30 day LIBOR. If this relationship continues, an increase in the 30 day LIBOR, of 1% (0.68% in tax exempt interest rates) would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $17.8 million on an annual basis. This would be offset by variable rate interest income earned on certain assets, including cash and cash equivalents and notes receivable, as well as interest that is capitalized on a portion of this variable rate debt incurred in connection with our redevelopment activities. Considering these offsets, the same increase in the 30 day LIBOR would result in our income before minority interests being reduced by $8.9 million on an annual basis. Comparatively, if the 30 day LIBOR had increased by 1% in 2004, our income before minority interests would have been reduced by $6.0 million on an annual basis. The potential reduction of income before minority interests was greater in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to higher floating rate balances resulting from additional borrowings, primarily related to the additional $100 million term loan, revolving loans and secured notes. We believe that the fair value of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of December 31, 2005 approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements was estimated based on the market rate for debt with the same or similar terms. The combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at December 31, 2005 was $4.3 billion compared to the estimated fair value of $4.4 billion (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 1%, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased from $4.4 billion to $4.1 billion. If market rates for our fixed rate debt were lower by 1%, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion.
