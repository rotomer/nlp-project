Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2006, we owned or managed 1,256 apartment properties containing 216,413 units located in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Funds From Operations, or FFO; FFO less spending for Capital Replacements, or AFFO; net asset value; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements, or Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. These terms are defined and described in the sections captioned Funds From Operations and Capital Expenditures below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; and interest rates. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties, the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties, and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. Our focus in 2006 has been to increase revenue and implement cost management and productivity initiatives, which includes centralizing purchasing, restructuring business processes, using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending. We believe that our efforts are having their intended effect, and have resulted in positive operating results and built the foundation for improved long term operating results. These initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality, and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions. For 2007, our focus will continue to include the following: enhance operations to improve and sustain customer satisfaction; obtain rate and occupancy increases to bring improved profitability; upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management, capital replacement, capital improvement and redevelopment; increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation; improve balance sheet flexibility; expand the use of tax credit equity to finance redevelopment of affordable properties; minimize our cost of capital; and monetize a portion of the value inherent in our properties with increased entitlements. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements. Results of Operations Overview 2006 compared to 2005 We reported net income of $176.8 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net income of $71.0 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, increases of $105.8 million and $112.7 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, reflecting improved operations of our same store properties and other properties, and a large number of newly consolidated properties; 23 Table of Contents an increase in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to higher net gains on dispositions of real estate; and an increase in gain on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other, including higher gains on sale of land parcels. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in depreciation and amortization expense; an increase in interest expense; and unfavorable changes in the effects of minority interests in our consolidated real estate partnerships. Our reported operating results for 2006 were affected significantly by our adoption of EITF 04 5, as discussed in Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. In accordance with the requirements of EITF 04 5, we consolidated 156 previously unconsolidated entities as of January 1, 2006. The consolidation of these entities contributed to increases in the reported amounts of certain revenue and expenses. 2005 compared to 2004 We reported net income of $71.0 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreases of $192.5 million and $191.7 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to lower net gains on dispositions of real estate; a decrease in gain on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other, primarily related to a 2004 gain on sale of land; an increase in depreciation and amortization expense; an increase in interest expense; and an increase in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, which included increases related to acquisition, newly consolidated and same store properties. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Rental Property Operations Our operating income is generated primarily from the operations of our consolidated apartment properties. The following table summarizes the overall performance of our properties for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Rental and other property revenues $ 1,629,988 $ 1,346,587 $ 1,211,865 Property operating expenses 758,128 633,984 567,937 Net operating income $ 871,860 $ 712,603 $ 643,928 For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $159.3 million, or 22.3%. The majority of this increase is attributable to newly consolidated properties (143 properties first consolidated in 2006 and 15 properties first consolidated in 2005), which contributed net operating income of $89.2 million in 2006. Newly consolidated properties are properties that: (i) were consolidated for all or part of the current year, (ii) were unconsolidated and 24 Table of Contents accounted for by the equity method for all or part of the corresponding prior year, and (iii) were not sold or classified as held for sale during the current year. The consolidation of properties upon adoption of EITF 04 5 resulted in an unusually large number of newly consolidated properties in 2006 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The increase in rental property net operating income also reflects: a $44.6 million increase for consolidated same store properties (see Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results below); a $9.5 million increase related to operations of the acquisition properties, consisting of nine properties purchased in 2006 and six properties (including the Palazzo East at Park La Brea) purchased in 2005; a $6.2 million improvement in our affordable property operations; and a $5.4 million increase related to properties undergoing redevelopment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $68.7 million, or 10.7%. This increase was principally due to a $40.3 million increase in consolidated same store net operating income (see Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results below); a $21.3 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of Palazzo East at Park La Brea and five other properties purchased in 2005 and The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004; a $10.6 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties (15 properties first consolidated in 2005 and 36 properties first consolidated in 2004); a $3.9 million increase related to operations of our affordable properties; and a $2.7 million increase related to the completion of certain redevelopment properties. These increases were offset by $6.4 million of increased property management expenses and $3.3 million of higher net casualty losses in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily relating to greater hurricane and tropical storm damage that occurred in 2005. Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define consolidated same store properties as conventional properties (i) that we manage, (ii) in which our ownership interest exceeds 10%, (iii) the operations of which have been stabilized for all periods presented, and (iv) that have not been classified as held for sale. The following tables summarize the operations of our consolidated conventional rental property operations: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change Consolidated same store revenues $ 1,075,434 $ 1,007,789 6.7% Consolidated same store expenses 458,449 435,370 5.3% Same store net operating income 616,985 572,419 7.8% Reconciling items(1) 254,875 140,184 81.8% Real estate segment net operating income $ 871,860 $ 712,603 22.3% Same store operating statistics: Properties 365 365 Apartment units 107,430 107,430 Average physical occupancy 94.4 % 92.4 % 2.0% Average rent/unit/month $ 811 $ 782 3.7% (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties, including those properties consolidated as a result of the adoption of EITF 04 5) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated same store net operating income increased $44.6 million, or 7.8%. Revenues increased $67.6 million, or 6.7%, primarily due to higher occupancy (up 2.0%), higher average rent (up $29 per unit) and a $7.5 million increase in utility reimbursements. Expenses increased by $23.1 million, or 5.3%, primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in real 25 Table of Contents estate taxes, a $6.2 million increase in utilities, a $4.8 million increase in insurance, and a $3.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change Consolidated same store revenues $ 988,952 $ 925,806 6.8% Consolidated same store expenses 428,218 405,370 5.6% Same store net operating income 560,734 520,436 7.7% Reconciling items(1) 151,869 123,502 23.0% Real estate segment net operating income $ 712,603 $ 643,938 10.7% Same store operating statistics: Properties 357 357 Apartment units 105,472 105,472 Average physical occupancy 92.4 % 90.1 % 2.3% Average rent/unit/month $ 782 $ 753 3.9% (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated same store net operating income increased $40.3 million, or 7.7%. Revenues increased $63.1 million, or 6.8%, primarily due to higher occupancy (up 2.3%), higher average rent (up $29 per unit), and a $9.4 million decrease in bad debt expense. Expenses increased by $22.8 million, or 5.6%, primarily due to a $7.7 million increase in real estate taxes, a $6.6 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses, and a $6.0 million increase in utilities. Property Management We earn income from property management primarily from certain unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner. The income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities. Reported revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships because it is eliminated in consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by GAAP. Additionally, our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold. Offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management. The following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Property management revenues, primarily from affiliates $ 12,312 $ 24,528 $ 32,461 Property management expenses 4,912 7,361 9,789 Net operating income from property management $ 7,400 $ 17,167 $ 22,672 For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, net operating income from property management decreased by $9.8 million, or 56.9%. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from property management decreased by $5.5 million, or 24.3%. In both comparisons the decreases were principally due to reductions in the numbers of unaffiliated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships that we managed. Most of these decreases resulted from the consolidation of partnerships due to increased ownership and GAAP requirements (including the adoption of EITF 04 5 in 2006 as discussed in Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), which required 26 Table of Contents elimination of fee income and reclassification of related property management expenses. Sales of properties by unconsolidated partnerships also contributed to the decreases in income from property management. Activity Fees and Asset Management Activity fees are generated from transactions, including dispositions, refinancings, sales promotes and tax credit syndications and redevelopments. These transactions occur on varying timetables, thus the income varies from period to period. The majority of these fees are realized in connection with transactions related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. We have a large number of affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities. As a result, we view activity fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy. Asset management revenue is from the financial management of partnerships, rather than management of day to day property operations. Asset management revenue includes certain fees that were earned in a prior period, but not recognized at that time because collectibility was not reasonably assured. Those fees may be recognized in a subsequent period upon occurrence of a transaction or improvement in operations that generates sufficient cash to pay the fees. Activity and asset management expenses are the direct expenses associated with transactional activities and asset management. These activities are conducted primarily by our taxable subsidiaries and the related operating income is generally subject to income taxes. As discussed in Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, in 2006 we revised our treatment of income from certain tax credit arrangements. The following table summarizes the operating results of our transactional and asset management activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, excluding related income tax effects (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Activity fees and asset management revenues $ 48,694 $ 37,349 $ 34,879 Activity and asset management expenses 9,521 10,628 11,879 Net operating income from activity fees and asset management $ 39,173 $ 26,721 $ 23,000 Included in the activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, were $41.4 million, $33.3 million and $30.3 million, respectively, of fees related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased $12.5 million, or 46.6%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including a $4.3 million increase in syndication fees and a $4.6 million increase in other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. The increase also reflects a $2.4 million increase in promote distributions from partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by $3.7 million, or 16.2%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to syndication and developer activities of $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as well as a $1.3 million decrease in expenses associated with these activities. Additionally, we received $3.1 million in promote distributions from an unconsolidated partnership, as a result of us, as general partner, achieving financial returns to the limited partners in excess of established targets. These increases were offset by a $5.2 million decrease in asset management fees and decreases of $3.3 million and $1.9 million in activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $94.4 million, or 25.1%. This increase was principally due to $39.7 million of depreciation for newly consolidated properties, particularly properties that were consolidated in 2006 in connection with the adoption of EITF 04 5 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and $46.2 million of depreciation related to assets recently placed in service, including acquired properties, redevelopment projects and other capital expenditures. Additionally, a $4.8 million increase resulted from a change 27 Table of Contents effective July 1, 2005 in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $60.8 million, or 19.3%. This increase was principally due to $31.9 million of additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively (see Impairment of Long Lived Assets in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8); $13.8 million and $8.3 million of additional depreciation related to newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively; and $11.0 million from the completion of certain redevelopment projects. Additionally, $4.3 million of the increase was due to a change in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, general and administrative expenses increased $8.9 million, or 9.6%. This increase reflects a $9.6 million increase in employee compensation and related costs, including higher stock based compensation and variable compensation based on achievement of established performance targets. The increase was partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in legal, audit and consulting expenses. In addition, in 2006 we recorded a $2.9 million adjustment based on an alternative method and revised assumptions for the valuation of High Performance Units (see High Performance Units in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, general and administrative expenses increased $15.4 million, or 19.9%. This increase was principally due to $14.1 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, increased health care costs, and transition costs associated with the chief financial and chief accounting officer positions. Additionally, in 2005 we accrued $0.6 million in severance costs related to the restructuring of regional operating centers as a result of property dispositions. Other Expenses (Income), Net Other expenses (income), net includes income tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships, partnership administration expenses and various other items. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, other expenses (income), net increased by $0.9 million, or 11.6%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million decrease in the income tax benefit for our continuing operations, reflecting smaller losses of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The decrease was partially offset by net favorable legal settlements and adjustments to accruals for loss contingencies. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, other expenses (income), net decreased by $4.4 million, or 35.6%. This decrease was principally due to a $9.5 million higher income tax benefit for our continuing operations, reflecting increased losses of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The decrease in other expenses was partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in partnership expenses, which was largely the result of higher professional fees, and other expenses increases and reclassifications. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, interest income increased $1.3 million, or 4.2%. This increase reflects $8.0 million in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances of newly consolidated properties, particularly properties consolidated as a result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The increase also 28 Table of Contents reflects a $4.6 million increase in interest income related to increased balances of notes receivable from non affiliates (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and $4.2 million of accretion income in connection with two property sales in 2006. These increases were largely offset by the elimination of $14.0 million in interest income on notes receivable from real estate partnerships that were consolidated in 2006 in connection with the adoption of EITF 04 5. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 3.4%. This decrease was principally the result of a $3.8 million reduction in accretion income, partially offset by higher interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts due to increased interest rates and higher cash balances. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $64.7 million, or 18.9%. This increase reflects $35.4 million in interest expense of newly consolidated properties, particularly those consolidated as a result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Additionally, interest expense on property debt increased by $33.9 million due to higher interest rates on variable rate loans, higher average balances related to refinancings and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a $6.9 million increase in capitalized interest, reflecting an increase in properties undergoing redevelopment and construction. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense increased $25.3 million, or 8.0%. This increase was principally due to interest on the additional debt related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties $16.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and a $17.7 million increase due to higher borrowings and interest rates on variable rate debt. These increases were partially offset by $4.8 million in lower amortization of loan costs, primarily due to corporate debt restructuring in 2005, $8.6 million in higher capitalized interest due to increased redevelopment activity, and a $2.1 million decrease related to the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 2004 and early 2005. Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the excess amount, even though there is no economic effect or cost. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, deficit distributions to minority partners increased $9.4 million, or 80.8%. This increase reflects higher levels of distributions to minority interests in 2006, including several large distributions in connection with debt refinancing transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $5.8 million, or 33.1%. This decrease was due to reduced levels of distributions being made by our consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity, decreased operating results, and our increased ownership of certain partnerships. Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes our share of gains related to dispositions of real estate by unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets, and costs related to asset disposal activities. The amounts of reported gains reflect the changing level of our disposition activity and may vary from period to period. Losses incurred in connection with these transactions are reported separately as impairments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $15.6 million. This increase is primarily attributable to an $11.0 million gain on the disposition of our interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated several student housing properties and a $9.0 million increase in gains on disposition of land and other non 29 Table of Contents depreciable assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our share of gains on sales of real estate by unconsolidated partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $50.3 million. This decrease reflects a $34.6 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in Florida and $17.4 million representing our share of a gain from the sale of an unconsolidated core property, both of which occurred in 2004. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This generally includes the minority partners share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. However, we generally do not recognize a benefit for the minority interest share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficits in partners equity. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed unfavorably by $24.7 million. This change is primarily attributable to our recognition of $25.0 million for minority partners share of losses of partnerships with deficits in equity as a result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The change also reflects differences related to our revised accounting treatment for tax credit arrangements (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), including (i) the reversal in 2006 of a previously recognized benefit of $9.0 million for losses of tax credit partnerships that were allocated to minority interests in prior years, but which are absorbed by us under our revised accounting treatment and (ii) a $6.7 million benefit recognized in 2005 for losses allocated to minority interests in tax credit partnerships, while no comparable amount was recognized in 2006 under our revised accounting treatment. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a $16.0 million net increase in the minority interest share of other real estate partnership losses. For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased $9.6 million. This decrease was driven by general improvement in property operating results during 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted in minority interests absorbing a lower amount of partnership losses. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net For properties accounted for as held for sale, the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property, and any related minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale, and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $219.5 million, $94.1 million and $209.7 million, respectively, which includes losses from operations of $0.8 million and $4.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and income from operations of $5.4 million in 2004. For 2006, the income from operations included the operating results of 77 properties and one tower of the Flamingo South Beach property (the South Tower) that were sold during 2006. For 2005 and 2004, the income from operations included the operating results of 160 properties and 214 properties, respectively, that were sold or classified as held for sale in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales, the income from operations is not comparable year to year. During 2006, we sold 77 properties and the South Tower, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $227.3 million (which is net of $32.9 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $0.4 million in impairment recoveries on assets sold in 2006 and $15.9 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority 30 Table of Contents partners. During 2005, we sold 83 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $98.5 million (which is net of $4.5 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $3.8 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2005 and $14.6 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2004, we sold 54 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $233.3 million (which is net of $16.0 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $7.3 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2004 and $3.2 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. See Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle On March 31, 2004, we recorded a $4.0 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 46. This charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded impairment losses of $3.4 million related to 31 Table of Contents properties to be held and used. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, we determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used was recoverable and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes, and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we identified and recorded an impairment loss on notes receivable of $2.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded net recoveries of $1.4 million and $1.8 million of previously recorded impairment losses on notes receivable, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects 32 Table of Contents are in progress. Costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed $250. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses. See Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $24.7 million, $18.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of interest costs and $66.2 million, $53.3 million and $46.7 million, respectively of site payroll and indirect costs. Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 33 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders(1) $ 95,655 $ (16,966 ) $ 174,693 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization(2) 470,597 376,231 315,451 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (19,620 ) (17,700 ) (18,349 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners and unconsolidated entities(3) (4,409 ) (12,474 ) (14,457 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners interest adjustment(4) 7,377 Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other (34,567 ) (18,958 ) (69,294 ) Gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets 11,525 2,480 38,977 Deficit distributions to minority partners(5) 21,004 11,615 17,374 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 3,957 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest(3) (260,206 ) (102,972 ) (249,353 ) Depreciation of rental property, net of minority partners interest(3) 16,910 51,897 59,297 Recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners, net(5) (15,927 ) (14,604 ) (3,231 ) Income tax arising from disposals 32,918 4,481 16,015 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (21,721 ) (28,382 ) (10,289 ) Preferred stock dividends 74,284 86,825 85,315 Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs 6,848 1,123 3,489 Funds From Operations $ 380,668 $ 322,596 $ 349,595 Preferred stock dividends (74,284 ) (86,825 ) (85,315 ) Redemption related preferred stock issuance costs (6,848 ) (1,123 ) (3,489 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 202 168 2,798 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 299,738 $ 234,816 $ 263,589 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding: Common shares and equivalents(6) 98,451 94,465 93,252 Dilutive preferred securities 71 74 1,106 Total 98,522 94,539 94,358 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for earnings per common share, calculated in accordance with GAAP. Based on circumstances and analysis that occurred after the date of our Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Release, we recorded a $2.9 million cumulative adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2006, which adjustment was based on an alternative valuation methodology and revised assumptions for certain High Performance Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership. As a result of this adjustment and the related impact on minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership, our net income attributable to common stockholders and Funds From Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, is approximately $2.6 million lower than the corresponding amounts previously reported in our Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Release. See High Performance Units in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 34 Table of Contents (2) Includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, we believe it is consistent with the White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry. (3) Minority partners interest, means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (4) Represents prior period depreciation of certain tax credit redevelopment properties that Aimco included in an adjustment to minority interest in real estate partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2006 (See Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). This prior period depreciation is added back to determine FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper. (5) In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners capital account, which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet. We record these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or (b) a payment related to the non controlling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. (6) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2006, we had $229.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $68.1 million from December 31, 2005. This increase reflects cash balances of newly consolidated properties and proceeds from sales and refinancing transactions that had not been distributed or applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). At December 31, 2006, we had $347.5 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in 35 Table of Contents cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, our net cash provided by operating activities of $532.3 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. Cash provided by operating activities increased $176.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005, driven by an increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash, net of an increase in restricted cash from newly consolidated properties, and an increase in deferred revenues. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, our net cash provided by investing activities of $233.0 million primarily resulted from proceeds received from the sales of properties, partially offset by originations of notes receivable relating to the West Harlem transaction, investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending as well as the acquisition of nine properties (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on acquisitions). Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold 77 consolidated properties and the South Tower of the Flamingo South Beach property. These properties and the South Tower were sold for an aggregate sales price of $1,110.7 million and generated proceeds totaling $958.6 million, after the payment of transaction costs and the assumption of debt. Sales proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes. We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long term investment strategy but offer attractive returns, such as sales to buyers who intend to convert the properties to condominiums. Gross sales proceeds from 2007 dispositions are expected to be $400 million to $600 million, and we plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, potentially repurchase Common Stock and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. Capital Expenditures We classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties or redevelopment. Non redevelopment and non casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents CI). For the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent a total of $76.6 million on CR. These are expenditures that represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent a total of $99.2 million, $35.8 million and $230.8 million, respectively, on CI, casualties and redevelopment. CI expenditures represent all non redevelopment and non casualty capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. Casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. 36 Table of Contents The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2006 on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 143,054 ownership equivalent units (excluding non managed units) weighted for the portion of the period that we owned the property), and reconciles it to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Actual Cost Cost Per Unit Capital Replacements Detail: Building and grounds $ 24,997 $ 175 Turnover related 40,002 279 Includes: carpet, vinyl, tile, appliance, and fixture replacements Capitalized site payroll and indirect costs 11,600 81 Our share of Capital Replacements $ 76,599 $ 535 Capital Replacements: Conventional $ 69,202 Affordable 7,397 Our share of Capital Replacements 76,599 Capital Improvements: Conventional 83,138 Affordable 16,108 Our share of Capital Improvements 99,246 Casualties: Conventional 29,756 Affordable 6,088 Our share of casualties 35,844 Redevelopment: Conventional 177,902 Affordable 52,944 Our share of redevelopment 230,846 Our share of capital expenditures 442,535 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 73,027 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (2,998 ) Total capital expenditures per consolidated statement of cash flows $ 512,564 Included in the above spending for CI, casualties and redevelopment, was approximately $54.8 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2006. We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital, property sales and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities of $697.2 million primarily related to repayments of property loans, redemptions of Class Q Cumulative Preferred Stock, Class R Cumulative Preferred Stock and Class X Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock and preferred stock dividends, distributions to minority interests, and repurchases of Common Stock. Proceeds from property loans, issuance of preferred stock and stock option exercises partially offset the cash outflow. 37 Table of Contents Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $6.3 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding, which included zero and $384.3 million, respectively, of mortgage debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 66 consolidated properties generating $1,224.6 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.66%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $589.4 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. On March 22, 2006, we amended various terms in our Credit Agreement, including the ability to request an increase in the aggregate commitments (which may be revolving or term loan commitments) by an amount not to exceed $150 million; a reduction in the interest rate spread applicable to revolving loans to LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 1.125% to 1.75%; a reduction in the interest rate spread applicable to letters of credit; a reduction in the spread applicable to term loans to LIBOR plus 1.5%; and an extension of the maturity dates from November 2, 2007, to May 1, 2009, for the revolver and from November 2, 2009, to March 22, 2011, for the term loans. The aggregate amount of commitments and loans under the Credit Agreement is $850.0 million, comprised of $400.0 million in term loans and $450.0 million of revolving loan commitments. At December 31, 2006, the term loans had an outstanding principal balance of $400.0 million and an interest rate of 6.91%. At December 31, 2006, the revolving loans had an outstanding principal balance of $140.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.725% (based on various weighted average LIBOR borrowings outstanding with various maturities). The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006, was $277.3 million (after giving effect to $32.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. For more information, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2006, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our 10.0% Class R Cumulative Preferred Stock for $173.5 million, all outstanding shares of our 10.1% Class Q Cumulative Preferred Stock for $63.3 million, and all outstanding shares of our 8.5% Class X Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock for $50.0 million. On June 29, 2006, we sold 200 shares of Series A Community Reinvestment Act Perpetual Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, which we refer to as the CRA Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $500,000 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $97.5 million. See Preferred Stock in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our preferred stock transactions during 2006. Under our shelf registration statement, as of December 31, 2006 we had available for issuance approximately $877 million of debt and equity securities and the Aimco Operating Partnership had available for issuance $500 million of debt securities. Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of Common Stock for cash totaling approximately $120.3 million. Currently, we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 5.7 million shares of our Common Stock under an authorization that has no expiration date. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total One Year Years Years 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 6,332,753 $ 449,848 $ 1,077,408 $ 847,195 $ 3,958,302 Secured credit facility and term loans 540,000 140,000 400,000 Redevelopment and other construction commitments 146,655 106,319 40,336 Leases for space occupied 39,804 8,270 13,763 9,126 8,645 Other obligations(1) 16,900 16,900 Total $ 7,076,112 $ 581,337 $ 1,271,507 $ 1,256,321 $ 3,966,947 (1) Includes a commitment to fund $14.4 million in second mortgage loans on certain properties in West Harlem, New York City and the final $2.5 million development fee payment to Casden Properties, LLC as a retainer on account for redevelopment services. In addition, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financings and operating cash flows. In 2007, we plan to invest between $275 and $325 million in conventional redevelopment projects that will impact approximately 79 properties with over 30,000 units. Additionally, in 2007 redevelopment expenditures on affordable properties will be approximately $36 million, predominantly funded by third party tax credit equity, impacting more than 15 properties with more than 1,800 units. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than 1% up to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses 39 Table of Contents and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We had $1,663.4 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. Of the total floating rate debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($640.6 million), floating rate secured notes ($482.8 million), revolving loans ($140.0 million), and term loans ($400.0 million). Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the BMA Index, which since 1981 has averaged 68% of the 30 day LIBOR rate. If this relationship continues, an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 1.0% (0.68% in tax exempt interest rates) would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $14.6 million on an annual basis. This would be offset by variable rate interest income earned on certain assets, including cash and cash equivalents and notes receivable, as well as interest that is capitalized on a portion of this variable rate debt incurred in connection with our redevelopment activities. Considering these offsets, the same increase in 30 day LIBOR would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $4.4 million on an annual basis. Comparatively, if 30 day LIBOR had increased by 1% in 2005, our income before minority interests and cash flows, after considering such offsets, would have been reduced by $8.5 million on an annual basis. The potential reduction of income before minority interests was lower in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to lower floating rate balances resulting from the sale of several properties that were encumbered by variable rate mortgages and the refinancing of existing variable rate mortgages. We believe that the fair value of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of December 31, 2006, approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements was estimated based on the market rate for debt with the same or similar terms. The combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at December 31, 2006 was $5.1 billion compared to the estimated fair value of $5.3 billion (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 1%, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased from $5.3 billion to $5.0 billion. If market rates for our fixed rate debt were lower by 1%, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion.
