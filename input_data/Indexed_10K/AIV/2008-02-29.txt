Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or managed 1,169 apartment properties containing 203,040 units located in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: NAV; Funds From Operations, or FFO; FFO less spending for Capital Replacements, or AFFO; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements, or Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. FFO and Capital Replacement are defined and further described in the sections captioned Funds From Operations and Capital Expenditures below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; and interest rates. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties, the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties, and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. Our focus in 2007 has been to enhance operations to improve and sustain resident satisfaction; obtain rate and occupancy increases to improve profitability; upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management, capital replacement, capital improvement and redevelopment; increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation; improve liquidity through balance sheet management; expand our asset management business and transactions activity; and minimize our cost of capital. We believe that our efforts are having their intended effect, and have resulted in positive operating results and built the foundation for improved long term operating results. These initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality, and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions. For 2008, our focus will continue to include the following: enhance operations to improve and sustain resident satisfaction; obtain rate and occupancy increases to improve profitability; upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management, capital replacement, capital improvement and redevelopment; increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation; improve balance sheet flexibility; expand the use of tax credit equity to generate fees and finance redevelopment of affordable properties; and minimize our cost of capital. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements in Item 8. Results of Operations Overview 2007 compared to 2006 We reported net income of $29.9 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to net income of $176.8 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreases of $146.9 million and $131.8 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, due primarily to decreases in net gains on dispositions of real estate; 22 Table of Contents an increase in interest expense, reflecting higher loan principal balances resulting from refinancings, share repurchases and acquisitions; and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, reflecting improved operations of our same store properties and other properties. 2006 compared to 2005 We reported net income of $176.8 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to net income of $71.0 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, increases of $105.8 million and $112.7 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section: an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, reflecting improved operations of our same store properties and other properties, and a large number of newly consolidated properties; an increase in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to higher net gains on dispositions of real estate; and an increase in gain on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other, including higher gains on sale of land parcels. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in depreciation and amortization expense; an increase in interest expense; and unfavorable changes in the effects of minority interests in our consolidated real estate partnerships. Our reported operating results for 2006 were affected significantly by our adoption of EITF 04 5, as discussed in Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. In accordance with the requirements of EITF 04 5, we consolidated 156 previously unconsolidated entities as of January 1, 2006. The consolidation of these entities contributed to increases in the reported amounts of certain revenue and expenses. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Business Segment Operating Results We have two reportable segments: real estate (owning, operating and redeveloping apartments) and asset management (providing asset management and investment services). Our reportable segments changed in 2007 as a result of the reorganization of certain departments and functions. These changes include a realignment of certain of our property management services from the asset management segment to the real estate segment. In addition, the asset management segment was expanded to include certain departments involved in asset acquisitions, dispositions, and other transactional activities. Prior to the reorganization, those departments were considered to be general and administrative functions and were not associated with any operating segment. Our chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of our executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business, including NAV, Free Cash Flow, net operating income, FFO, and AFFO. The chief operating decision maker emphasizes net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Segment net operating income is generally defined as segment revenues less direct segment operating expenses. Real Estate Segment Our real estate segment involves the ownership and operation of properties that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment units. Our real estate segments net operating income also 23 Table of Contents includes income from property management services performed for unconsolidated partnerships and unrelated parties. The following table summarizes our real estate segments net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Real estate segment revenues: Rental and other property revenues $ 1,640,506 $ 1,540,500 $ 1,283,815 Property management revenues, primarily from affiliates 6,923 12,312 24,528 1,647,429 1,552,812 1,308,343 Real estate segment expenses: Property operating expenses 768,457 709,694 599,208 Property management expenses 5,506 5,111 7,499 773,963 714,805 606,707 Real estate segment net operating income $ 873,466 $ 838,007 $ 701,636 Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define consolidated same store properties as our conventional properties (i) that we manage, (ii) in which our ownership interest exceeds 10%, (iii) the operations of which have been stabilized, and (iv) that have not been sold or classified as held for sale, in each case, throughout all periods presented. The following tables summarize the operations of our consolidated conventional rental property operations: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Consolidated same store revenues $ 1,110,079 $ 1,060,897 4.6 % Consolidated same store expenses 467,373 447,803 4.4 % Same store net operating income 642,706 613,094 4.8 % Reconciling items(1) 230,760 224,913 2.6 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 873,466 $ 838,007 4.2 % Same store operating statistics: Properties 347 347 Apartment units 103,629 103,629 Average physical occupancy 94.7 % 94.5 % 0.2 % Average rent/unit/month $ 863 $ 833 3.6 % (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated same store net operating income increased $29.6 million, or 4.8%. Revenues increased $49.2 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to higher average rent (up $30 per unit) and a $9.0 million increase in utility reimbursements. Expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to an $8.5 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses, $3.0 million increases in each of marketing expense and contract service expense, a $2.5 million increase in utilities and a $2.4 million increase in property insurance expense. 24 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change Consolidated same store revenues $ 960,887 $ 901,121 6.6 % Consolidated same store expenses 407,248 387,635 5.1 % Same store net operating income 553,639 513,486 7.8 % Reconciling items(1) 284,368 188,150 51.1 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 838,007 $ 701,636 19.4 % Same store operating statistics: Properties 315 315 Apartment units 95,227 95,227 Average physical occupancy 94.5 % 92.5 % 2.0 % Average rent/unit/month $ 820 $ 790 3.8 % (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties, including those properties consolidated as a result of the adoption of EITF 04 5) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated same store net operating income increased $40.2 million, or 7.8%. Revenues increased $59.8 million, or 6.6%, primarily due to higher occupancy (up 2.0%), higher average rent (up $30 per unit), and a $6.9 million increase in utility reimbursements. Expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 5.1%, primarily due to a $5.9 million increase in administrative expenses, a $5.8 million increase in real estate taxes, a $5.4 million increase in utilities and a $3.8 million increase in insurance. Asset Management Segment Our asset management segment includes activities related to our owned portfolio of properties as well as services provided to affiliated partnerships. Within our owned portfolio, these activities include strategic capital allocation decisions and portfolio management activities. We provide similar services to affiliated partnerships, together with such other services as property management, asset management, financial management, accounting, investor reporting, property debt financings, tax credit syndication, redevelopment and construction management. The expenses of this segment consist primarily of the costs of departments that perform transactional activities and asset management services. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes. Transactions occur on varying timetables; thus, the income varies from period to period. We have affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities. As a result, we view activity fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy. Asset management revenue is from the financial management of partnerships, rather than management of day to day property operations. Asset management revenue includes certain fees that were earned in a prior period, but not recognized at that time because collectibility was not reasonably assured. Those fees may be recognized in a subsequent period upon occurrence of a transaction or a high level of the probability of occurrence of a transaction within twelve months, or improvement in operations that generates sufficient cash to pay the fees. The following table summarizes the net operating income from our asset management segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Activity fees and asset management revenues $ 73,755 $ 48,893 $ 37,349 Activity and asset management expenses 23,102 17,342 19,316 Asset management segment net operating income $ 50,653 $ 31,551 $ 18,033 25 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased $19.1 million, or 60.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to a $9.6 million increase in promote income, an $8.6 million increase in asset management fees and an increase of $9.1 million in revenues associated with our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses and a decrease in other transaction fees. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased $13.5 million, or 75.0%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including a $4.3 million increase in syndication fees and a $4.6 million increase in other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. The increase also reflects a $2.4 million increase in promote distributions from partnerships. Other Operating Expenses (Income) Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization increased $35.1 million, or 7.7%. This increase reflects depreciation of $23.7 million for newly acquired properties, completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. Depreciation also increased by approximately $8.6 million as a result of depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements to their estimated disposition value or to zero in connection with a planned demolition (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $80.2 million, or 21.5%. This increase was principally due to $31.0 million of depreciation for newly consolidated properties, particularly properties that were consolidated in 2006 in connection with the adoption of EITF 04 5 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and $44.4 million of depreciation related to assets recently placed in service, including acquired properties, redevelopment projects and other capital expenditures. Additionally, a $4.8 million increase resulted from a change effective July 1, 2005 in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 1.0%. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits (net of capitalization) related to additional redevelopment personnel and an increase in director compensation resulting from the addition of two new board members. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, general and administrative expenses increased $7.1 million, or 8.6%. This increase reflects a $9.6 million increase in employee compensation and related costs, including higher stock based compensation and variable compensation based on achievement of established performance targets. The increase was partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in legal, audit and consulting expenses. Other Expenses (Income), Net Other expenses (income), net includes the income tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, other expenses (income), net changed favorably by $7.6 million. The net favorable change reflects an $8.7 million increase in income tax benefits related to losses of our taxable subsidiaries, a $2.9 million charge recorded in 2006 related to the valuation of the High Performance Units (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and a 26 Table of Contents $1.7 million charge for one time benefits to certain employees terminated in 2006 that did not recur in 2007. Other expenses (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2007, also includes $3.6 million related to the transfer of certain property rights to an unrelated party. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes related our self insurance activities, including a $7.9 million increase in claims on our consolidated properties in excess of reimbursements from third parties, and the settlement of certain litigation matters which resulted in a $2.5 million unfavorable change during the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, other expenses (income), net changed unfavorably by $10.4 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $4.2 million decrease in the income tax benefit for our continuing operations, reflecting smaller losses of our taxable subsidiaries, an increase of $3.3 million in partnership expenses resulting from properties newly consolidated in 2006, and a $2.9 million charge recorded in 2006 related to the valuation of the High Performance Units (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, interest income increased $8.5 million, or 25.0%. This increase is primarily due to $5.9 million of interest income earned during 2007 on loans collateralized by properties in West Harlem in New York City, which were funded in November 2006, and an increase in interest income earned on escrowed funds related to a tax exempt bond financing transaction and certain property sales during 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, interest income increased $2.6 million, or 8.1%. This increase reflects $8.0 million in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances of newly consolidated properties, particularly properties consolidated as a result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The increase also reflects a $4.6 million increase in interest income related to increased balances of notes receivable from non affiliates (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and $4.2 million of accretion income in connection with two property sales in 2006. These increases were largely offset by the elimination of $14.0 million in interest income on notes receivable from real estate partnerships that were consolidated in 2006 in connection with the adoption of EITF 04 5. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $30.7 million, or 7.8%. Interest on property debt increased $33.8 million primarily due to higher balances resulting from refinancing activities and mortgage loans on newly acquired properties, offset by lower weighted average rates. Corporate interest increased by $3.1 million as a result of higher weighted average rates and a higher average balance during the year ended December 31, 2007. These increases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in capitalized interest related to increased levels of redevelopment and entitlement activities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $60.7 million, or 18.4%. This increase reflects $28.4 million in interest expense of newly consolidated properties, particularly those consolidated as a result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Additionally, interest expense on property debt increased by $33.9 million due to higher interest rates on variable rate loans, higher average balances related to refinancings and acquisitions. Corporate interest increased by $1.8 million as a result of higher weighted average rates and a higher average balance during the year ended December 31, 2006. These increases were partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in capitalized interest, related to increased levels of redevelopment and entitlement activities. 27 Table of Contents Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships that are consolidated in our financial statements disburse cash to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the excess amount, even though there is no economic effect or cost. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, deficit distributions to minority partners increased $18.3 million, or 88.2%. This increase reflects higher levels of distributions to minority interests in 2007, including several large distributions in connection with debt refinancing transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, deficit distributions to minority partners increased $9.3 million, or 80.8%. This increase reflects higher levels of distributions to minority interests in 2006, including several large distributions in connection with debt refinancing transactions. Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes our share of gains related to dispositions of real estate by unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other also includes a gain on extinguishment of debt. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $4.9 million, or 18.4%. This increase is primarily related to a $19.4 million gain on debt extinguishment related to seven properties in the VMS partnership (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and the recognition of $7.2 million of non refundable fees and deposits related to certain property transactions (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) in 2007 relative to net gains of $26.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, on the sale of parcels of land, interests in unconsolidated real estate properties and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated several student housing properties. For the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $9.7 million. This increase is primarily attributable to an $11.0 million gain on the disposition of our interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated several student housing properties. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This generally includes the minority partners share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. However, we generally do not recognize a benefit for the minority interest share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficits in partners equity. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed favorably by $10.3 million. This change is primarily attributable to our revised accounting treatment for tax credit arrangements (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) which resulted in the reversal in 2006 of a previously recognized benefit of $9.0 million for losses of tax credit partnerships that were allocated to minority interests in prior years, but which are absorbed by us under our revised accounting treatment. This favorable change was in addition to a net decrease in the minority interest share of other real estate partnership losses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed unfavorably by $17.2 million. This change is primarily attributable to our recognition of $24.6 million for minority partners share of losses of partnerships with deficits in equity as a 28 Table of Contents result of adopting EITF 04 5 in 2006 (see Adoption of EITF 04 5 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The change also reflects differences related to our revised accounting treatment for tax credit arrangements (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), including (i) the reversal in 2006 of a previously recognized benefit of $9.0 million for losses of tax credit partnerships that were allocated to minority interests in prior years, but which are absorbed by us under our revised accounting treatment and (ii) a $6.7 million benefit recognized in 2005 for losses allocated to minority interests in tax credit partnerships, while no comparable amount was recognized in 2006 under our revised accounting treatment. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a $23.1 million net increase in the minority interest share of other real estate partnership losses. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property, and any related minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $78.0 million, $219.3 million and $95.1 million, respectively. The $141.3 million decrease in income from discontinued operations from 2006 to 2007 was principally due to a $194.5 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interests and a $19.5 million decrease in operating income, offset by a $22.9 million decrease in interest expense, a $30.8 million favorable change in income tax arising from disposals and a $22.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to mortgage loans secured by the eight VMS properties sold to third parties during 2007 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The $124.2 million increase in income from discontinued operations from 2005 to 2006 was principally due to a $155.0 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interests, a $26.4 million decrease in interest expense and an impairment recovery of $0.4 million in 2006 versus an impairment charge of $3.8 million in 2005, offset by a $23.7 million decrease in operating income, a $28.4 million increase in income tax arising from disposals and a $12.6 million increase in minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership. During 2007, we sold 73 consolidated properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $63.2 million (which is net of $2.1 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $0.1 million in impairment recoveries on assets sold in 2007 and $0.4 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2006, we sold 77 consolidated properties and the South Tower of the Flamingo South Beach property, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $226.9 million (which is net of $32.9 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $0.4 million in impairment recoveries on assets sold in 2006 and $15.7 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2005, we sold 83 consolidated properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $100.3 million (which is net of $4.5 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $3.8 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2005 and $14.5 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold during these years as well the operating results of three properties classified as held for sale at December 31, 2007. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the 29 Table of Contents following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. From time to time, we have non revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. At December 31, 2007, we evaluated our Lincoln Place property in Venice, CA and determined that the carrying amount of $189.3 million was recoverable based on our probability weighted assessment of undiscounted cash flows. Plans to develop Lincoln Place have been the subject of controversy and litigation, which reduces its market value and may result in a future impairment. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, we recorded net impairment losses of $6.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, related to properties to be held and used. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded net recoveries of previously recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. Notes receivable from non affiliates consists of notes receivable from unrelated third parties. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes, and loans extended by predecessors, some of whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. 30 Table of Contents We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recorded net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $4.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded net recoveries of previously recorded provisions for losses on notes receivable of $1.4 million. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. Costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed $250. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $30.8 million, $24.7 million and $18.1 million, respectively, of interest costs, and $78.1 million, $66.2 million and $53.3 million, respectively, of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Funds From Operations FFO is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders(1) $ (36,105 ) $ 95,655 $ (16,966 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization(2) 487,822 452,741 372,526 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (21,258 ) (25,511 ) (29,496 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners and unconsolidated entities(3)(4) (32,150 ) (7,314 ) (8,131 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners interest adjustment(5) 7,377 Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other (31,777 ) (26,845 ) (17,152 ) Gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets and debt extinguishment gain 26,702 11,526 2,480 Deficit distributions to minority partners(6) 39,150 20,802 11,505 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest(3) (65,378 ) (259,855 ) (104,807 ) Depreciation of rental property, net of minority partners interest(3)(4) (8,385 ) 35,487 63,083 Recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners, net(6) (390 ) (15,724 ) (14,493 ) Income tax arising from disposals 2,135 32,918 4,481 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (36,830 ) (21,721 ) (28,382 ) Preferred stock dividends 63,381 74,284 86,825 Preferred stock redemption related costs 2,635 6,848 1,123 Funds From Operations $ 389,552 $ 380,668 $ 322,596 Preferred stock dividends (63,381 ) (74,284 ) (86,825 ) Preferred stock redemption related costs (2,635 ) (6,848 ) (1,123 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 1,875 202 168 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 325,411 $ 299,738 $ 234,816 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding(8): Common shares and equivalents(7) 102,017 103,161 98,996 Dilutive preferred securities 609 75 78 Total 102,626 103,236 99,074 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for earnings per common share, calculated in accordance with GAAP. (2) Includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, we believe it is consistent with the White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry. 32 Table of Contents (3) Minority partners interest, means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (4) Adjustments related to minority partners share of depreciation of rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007, include the subtraction of $15.1 million and $17.8 million for continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, related to the VMS debt extinguishment gains (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). These subtractions are required because we added back the minority partners share of depreciation related to rental property in determining FFO in prior periods. Accordingly, the net effect of the VMS debt extinguishment gains on our FFO for the year ended December 31, 2007, was an increase of $9.3 million ($8.4 million after Minority Interest in Aimco Operating Partnership). (5) Represents prior period depreciation of certain tax credit redevelopment properties that Aimco included in an adjustment to minority interest in real estate partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2006 (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). This prior period depreciation is added back to determine FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper. (6) In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners capital account, which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet. We record these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or (b) a payment related to the non controlling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. (7) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO. (8) Weighted average common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities amounts for the periods presented have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of 4,573,735 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the special dividend discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2007, we had $210.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $19.4 million from December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, we had $319.0 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated 33 Table of Contents basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net cash provided by operating activities of $465.5 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $53.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006, driven by cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $12.6 million in 2007 compared to $65.7 million in 2006. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, our net cash used in investing activities of $271.6 million primarily resulted from investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending as well as the acquisition of 16 properties and purchases of interests in real estate partnerships (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on acquisitions), partially offset by proceeds received from the sales of properties and the sales of partnership interests. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold 73 consolidated properties for an aggregate sales price of $493.5 million, generating proceeds totaling $431.9 million after the payment of transaction costs and the buyers assumption of debt. Sales proceeds were used to repay property level debt, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repurchase shares of our Common Stock and for other corporate purposes. We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long term investment strategy but offer attractive returns. We plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, repurchase shares of our Common Stock, and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. Capital Expenditures We classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties, redevelopment or entitlement. Expenditures other than casualty, redevelopment and entitlement capital expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property. CR represents the share of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the portion of acquired capital assets that was consumed during the period we have owned the asset. CI represents the share of expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset as compared to its original purchase condition. CR and CI excludes capital expenditures for casualties, redevelopment and entitlements. Casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. Entitlement expenditures represent costs incurred in connection with obtaining local governmental approvals to increase density and add residential units to a site. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent a total of $102.6 million, $123.7 million, $12.7 million, $352.8 million and $26.3 million on CR, CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement, respectively. The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlements for the year ended December 31, 2007, on a total dollar basis. Per unit numbers for CR and CI are based on approximately 132,862 average units for the year including 115,046 conventional units and 17,817 affordable units. Average units are weighted for the portion of the period that we owned an interest in the property, represent ownership adjusted effective units, and exclude non 34 Table of Contents managed units. Total capital expenditures are reconciled to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Aimcos Share of Expenditures Per Effective Unit Capital Replacements Detail: Building and grounds $ 43,579 $ 328 Turnover related 45,635 343 Capitalized site payroll and indirect costs 13,398 101 Our share of Capital Replacements $ 102,612 $ 772 Capital Replacements: Conventional $ 95,329 $ 829 Affordable 7,283 $ 409 Our share of Capital Replacements 102,612 $ 772 Capital Improvements: Conventional 113,977 $ 991 Affordable 9,684 $ 544 Our share of Capital Improvements 123,661 $ 931 Casualties: Conventional 11,404 Affordable 1,313 Our share of casualties 12,717 Redevelopment: Conventional projects 290,898 Tax credit projects 61,919 Our share of redevelopment 352,817 Entitlement 26,304 Our share of capital expenditures 618,111 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 72,358 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (750 ) Total capital expenditures per consolidated statement of cash flows $ 689,719 Included in the above spending for CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement, was approximately $68.1 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital, property sales and borrowings under our Credit Facility, as discussed below. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in financing activities of $213.3 million primarily related to repayments of property loans, distributions to minority interests, payment of common and preferred dividends, repurchases of Common Stock and redemption of the Class W Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. Proceeds from property loans and stock option exercises partially offset the cash outflow. Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $7.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding, which included $11.6 million and $239.2 million, respectively, of mortgage debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 144 consolidated properties generating $1,795.5 million of proceeds from borrowings with a 35 Table of Contents weighted average interest rate of 6.09%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $864.2 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities, generally not to increase loan to value, but as a means to monetize asset appreciation. Credit Facility We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we amended various terms in our Credit Agreement which included (i) an increase in aggregate commitments; (ii) a modification of the capitalization rate used in the calculation of certain financial covenants; (iii) a modification to permit proceeds of loans under the Credit Agreement to be used to repurchase equity interests of the borrowers, including our Common Stock, and provide that the purchase of such equity interests is not restricted as long as no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement exists; and (iv) elimination of the limitation on incurrence of indebtedness that is pari passu with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement was expanded from total commitments of $850.0 million to $1.125 billion. Prior to the amendments, the Credit Agreement was comprised of $400.0 million in term loans and $450.0 million of revolving loan commitments. In connection with the amendments, we obtained an additional term loan of $75.0 million with a one year term and pricing equal to LIBOR plus 1.375%, or a base rate at our option, and additional revolving loan commitments totaling $200.0 million with the same maturity and pricing as the existing revolving loan commitments. We may extend the $75.0 million term loan for one year, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of a 12.5 basis point fee on the amount of the term loan then outstanding. We are also permitted to increase the aggregate commitments (which may be revolving or term loan commitments) by an amount not to exceed $175.0 million, subject to receipt of commitments from lenders and other customary conditions. At December 31, 2007, the term loans had an outstanding principal balance of $475.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.38%. At December 31, 2007, the revolving loan commitments were $650.0 million and had no outstanding principal balance. The amount available under the revolving loan commitments at December 31, 2007, was $606.5 million (after giving effect to $43.5 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving loan commitments). Equity Transactions On December 21, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $2.51 per share payable on January 30, 2008 to holders of record of our Common Stock on December 31, 2007. Stockholders had the option to elect to receive payment of the special dividend in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, except that the aggregate amount of cash payable to all stockholders in the special dividend was limited to $55.0 million plus cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The special dividend, totaling $232.9 million, was paid on 92,795,891 shares issued and outstanding on the record date, which included 416,140 shares held by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. Approximately $177.9 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 4,594,074 shares of Common Stock (including 20,339 shares issued to consolidated subsidiaries holding our shares), which was determined based on the average closing price of our Common Stock on January 23 24, 2008, or $38.71 per share. After elimination of the effect of shares held by consolidated subsidiaries, the special dividend totaled $231.9 million. Approximately $177.1 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 4,573,735 shares of Common Stock (excluding 20,339 shares issued to our consolidated subsidiaries) to holders of 92,379,751 shares of our Common Stock on the record date (excluding 416,140 shares held by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries), representing an increase of approximately 4.95% to the then outstanding shares. The effect of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to the special dividend has been retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods presented as if those shares were issued and outstanding at the beginning of 36 Table of Contents the earliest period presented; accordingly all activity including share issuances, repurchases and forfeitures have been adjusted to reflect the 4.95% increase in the number of shares, except in limited instances where noted. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our privately held 8.1% Class W Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $102.0 million, excluding accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption (see Preferred Stock in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our preferred stock transactions during 2007). Under our shelf registration statement, as of December 31, 2007, we had available for issuance approximately $877.0 million of debt and equity securities and the Aimco Operating Partnership had available for issuance $500.0 million of debt securities. At January 30, 2008, following the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to the special dividend discussed above, we had available for issuance approximately $699.1 million of debt and equity securities. Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares of Common Stock (7.8 million shares after the effect of the special dividend) for approximately $325.8 million. As of December 31, 2007, we were authorized to repurchase approximately 8.2 million additional shares of our Common Stock under an authorization that has no expiration date. On January 29, 2008, our Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase by 25.0 million shares. Between January 1, 2008 and February 15, 2008, we repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares of Common Stock for approximately $170.6 million, or $33.67 per share. Future repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total One Year Years Years 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 7,056,782 $ 455,776 $ 1,170,581 $ 983,860 $ 4,446,565 Term loans 475,000 75,000 400,000 Redevelopment and other construction commitments 151,953 145,552 6,401 Leases for space occupied 39,668 9,001 13,766 10,214 6,687 Other obligations(1) 6,200 6,200 Total $ 7,729,603 $ 616,529 $ 1,265,748 $ 1,394,074 $ 4,453,252 (1) Represents a commitment to fund $6.2 million in second mortgage loans on certain properties in West Harlem, New York City. In addition, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows. 37 Table of Contents In 2008, we expect to invest between $250.0 and $300.0 million in conventional redevelopment projects and we expect to invest approximately $72.0 million in affordable redevelopment projects, predominantly funded by third party tax credit equity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than 1% up to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary or to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We had $1,754.4 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. Of the total floating rate debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($698.4 million), floating rate secured notes ($572.5 million), and term loans ($475.0 million). Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the SIFMA rate (previously the Bond Market Association index), which since 1981 has averaged 68% of the 30 day LIBOR rate. If this relationship continues, an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 1.0% (0.68% in tax exempt interest rates) would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $15.3 million on an annual basis. This would be offset by variable rate interest income earned on certain assets, including cash and cash equivalents and notes receivable, as well as interest that is capitalized on a portion of this variable rate debt incurred in connection with our redevelopment activities. Considering these offsets, the same increase in 30 day LIBOR would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by $6.5 million on an annual basis. Comparatively, if 30 day LIBOR had increased by 1% in 2006, our income before minority interests and cash flows, after considering such offsets would have been reduced by $8.5 million on an annual basis. The potential reduction of income before minority interests was higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher floating rate balances resulting from refinancing of certain fixed rate mortgages and increases in our use of total rate of return swaps to effectively convert higher fixed rate debt to lower variable rates benchmarked against the BMA index (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of total rate of return swaps). We believe that the fair values of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of December 31, 2007, approximate their carrying values. The fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements was estimated based on the market rate for debt with the same or similar terms. The combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at December 31, 2007 was $5.7 billion compared to the estimated fair value of $5.8 billion (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 1%, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased from $5.8 billion to $5.5 billion.
