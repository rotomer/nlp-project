Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2008, we owned or managed 992 apartment properties containing 162,807 units located in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: NAV; Funds From Operations, or FFO; Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, which is FFO less spending for Capital Replacements; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements, or Free Cash Flow; Economic Income; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. FFO and Capital Replacements are defined and further described in the sections captioned Funds From Operations and Capital Expenditures below. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; interest rates; and availability and cost of financing. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties, the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties, and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. As the financial and economic environment became more challenging during 2008, we focused on: serving and retaining residents; controlling costs and increasing efficiency through improved business processes and automation; controlling capital spending; minimizing our cost of capital, building cash and reducing leverage; and upgrading the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management. Additionally, in connection with 2008 property sales and expected reductions in redevelopment and transactional activities, we initiated an organizational restructuring during the fourth quarter of 2008. We expect 2009 to continue to be very difficult and will continue to evaluate our activities and organizational structure, and intend to adjust as necessary. Our portfolio management strategy includes property dispositions and acquisitions aimed at concentrating our portfolio in our target markets. Over the next two years and subject to market conditions and various REIT requirements, we expect to sell approximately $2.0 billion of conventional and affordable assets located primarily outside these target markets. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview 2008 compared to 2007 We reported net income of $415.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $361.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to net income of $29.9 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, increases of $385.6 million and $397.9 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below: an increase in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to higher net gains on sales of real estate; an increase in gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other, primarily related to our disposition in 2008 of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships; and an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, reflecting improved operations of our same store properties and other properties. The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by: a provision for impairment losses on real estate development assets; an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to completed redevelopments; and a restructuring provision recognized during the fourth quarter of 2008. 2007 compared to 2006 We reported net income of $29.9 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to net income of $176.8 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, decreases of $146.9 million and $131.8 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily due to decreases in net gains on dispositions of real estate; an increase in interest expense, reflecting higher loan principal balances resulting from refinancings, share repurchases and acquisitions; and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to completed redevelopments and newly consolidated properties. The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by: an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, reflecting improved operations of our same store properties and other properties; and the recognition in 2007 of deferred debt extinguishment gains in connection with the refinancing of certain mortgage loans that had been restructured in a 1997 bankruptcy settlement. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Business Segment Operating Results We have two reportable segments: real estate (owning, operating and redeveloping apartments) and investment management (portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities). Several members of our executive management team comprise our chief operating decision maker, as defined in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About 24 Table of Contents Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and use various generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance and financial condition of the business, including: NAV; FFO; AFFO; same store property operating results; net operating income; Free Cash Flow; Economic Income; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. The chief operating decision maker emphasizes net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Segment net operating income is generally defined as segment revenues less direct segment operating expenses. Real Estate Segment Our real estate segment involves the ownership and operation of properties that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment units. Our real estate segments net operating income also includes income from property management services performed for unconsolidated partnerships and unrelated parties. The following table summarizes our real estate segments net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Real estate segment revenues: Rental and other property revenues $ 1,350,950 $ 1,296,142 $ 1,212,958 Property management revenues, primarily from affiliates 6,345 6,923 12,312 1,357,295 1,303,065 1,225,270 Real estate segment expenses: Property operating expenses 626,001 596,902 549,716 Property management expenses 5,385 6,678 6,289 631,386 603,580 556,005 Real estate segment net operating income $ 725,909 $ 699,485 $ 669,265 Consolidated Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define consolidated same store properties as our conventional properties (i) that we manage, (ii) in which our ownership interest exceeds 10%, (iii) the operations of which have been stabilized, and (iv) that have not been sold or classified as held for sale, in each case, throughout all periods presented. The following tables summarize the operations of our consolidated conventional rental property operations: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change Consolidated same store revenues. $ 837,748 $ 821,287 2.0 % Consolidated same store expenses 325,514 329,122 (1.1 )% Same store net operating income 512,234 492,165 4.1 % Reconciling items(1) 213,675 207,320 3.1 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 725,909 $ 699,485 3.8 % Same store operating statistics: Properties 219 219 Apartment units 69,565 69,565 Average physical occupancy 94.9 % 94.7 % 0.2 % Average rent/unit/month $ 970 $ 954 1.7 % 25 Table of Contents (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated same store net operating income increased $20.1 million, or 4.1%. Revenues increased $16.5 million, or 2.0%, primarily due to higher average rent (up $16 per unit) and an increase in average physical occupancy. Expenses decreased by $3.6 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to decreases of $2.2 million in repair and maintenance expense, $1.4 million in turnover expense and $1.9 million in employee compensation and related expenses, offset by an increase of $2.0 million in utilities expense. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated real estate segment net operating income related to consolidated properties other than same store properties increased by $6.4 million, or 3.1%. Increases in net operating income attributable to affordable, acquisition and redevelopment properties contributed to the increase, and were partially offset by increases in casualty losses of $6.5 million, including $2.7 million related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike during the year ended December 31, 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change Consolidated same store revenues $ 821,287 $ 780,052 5.3 % Consolidated same store expenses 329,122 315,461 4.3 % Same store net operating income 492,165 464,591 5.9 % Reconciling items(1) 207,320 204,674 1.3 % Real estate segment net operating income $ 699,485 $ 669,265 4.5 % Same store operating statistics: Properties 219 219 Apartment units 69,565 69,565 Average physical occupancy 94.7 % 94.7 % Average rent/unit/month $ 954 $ 914 4.4 % (1) Reflects property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties (e.g., affordable, acquisition, redevelopment and newly consolidated properties) and casualty gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated same store net operating income increased $27.6 million, or 5.9%. Revenues increased $41.2 million, or 5.3%, primarily due to higher average rent (up $40 per unit) and a $6.4 million increase in utility reimbursements. Expenses increased by $13.7 million, or 4.3%, primarily due to increases of $5.1 million in employee compensation and related expenses, $2.5 million in contract services expense, $2.3 million in marketing expense, $2.1 million in taxes and $2.0 million in insurance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated real estate segment net operating income related to consolidated properties other than same store properties increased by $2.6 million, or 1.3%. Increases in net operating income attributable to affordable, acquisition and redevelopment properties contributed to the increase, and were partially offset by an unfavorable change in casualty losses, resulting from casualty gains recognized in 2006. Investment Management Segment Our investment management segment includes activities and services related to our owned portfolio of properties as well as services provided to affiliated partnerships. Activities and services that fall within investment management include portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. Within our owned portfolio, we refer to these activities as Portfolio 26 Table of Contents Management, and their benefit is seen in property operating results and in investment gains. For affiliated partnerships, we refer to these activities as Asset Management, for which we are separately compensated through fees paid by third party investors. The expenses of this segment consist primarily of the costs of departments that perform these activities. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes. Transactions occur on varying timetables; thus, the income varies from period to period. We have affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities. As a result, we view asset management fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy. Asset management revenue includes certain fees that were earned in a prior period, but not recognized at that time because collectibility was not reasonably assured. Those fees may be recognized in a subsequent period upon occurrence of a transaction or a high level of the probability of occurrence of a transaction within twelve months, or improvement in operations that generates sufficient cash to pay the fees. The following table summarizes the net operating income from our investment management segment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Asset management and tax credit revenues $ 100,623 $ 73,755 $ 48,893 Investment management expenses 21,389 20,514 14,742 Investment segment net operating income(1) $ 79,234 $ 53,241 $ 34,151 (1) Excludes certain items of income and expense, which are included in our consolidated statements of income in: other expenses, net; interest expense; interest income; (loss) gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other; and minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, net operating income from investment management increased $26.0 million, or 48.8%. This increase is attributable to a $30.7 million increase in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures, and a $9.2 million increase in other general partner transactional fees, partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in asset management fees, a $0.9 million increase in investment management expenses and a $5.0 million decrease in revenues associated with our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, net operating income from investment management increased $19.1 million, or 55.9%. This increase is primarily attributable to a $9.6 million increase in promote income, an $8.6 million increase in asset management fees and an increase of $9.1 million in revenues associated with our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses and a decrease in other general partner transactional fees. Other Operating Expenses (Income) Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, depreciation and amortization increased $54.8 million, or 13.6%. This increase reflects depreciation of $74.8 million for newly acquired properties, completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $25.7 million in depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements to their estimated disposition value, or zero in the case of a planned demolition (see Impairment of Long Lived Assets in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization increased $35.0 million, or 9.5%. This increase reflects depreciation of $23.7 million for newly acquired properties, completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. Depreciation 27 Table of Contents also increased by approximately $8.6 million as a result of depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements to their estimated disposition value, or to zero in connection with a planned demolition (see Impairment of Long Lived Assets in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, general and administrative expenses increased $8.4 million, or 9.2%. This increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel and related expenses of $6.1 million and an increase of $1.5 million in information technology communications costs. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 1.0%. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits (net of capitalization) related to additional redevelopment personnel and an increase in director compensation resulting from the addition of two new board members. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, other expenses, net changed unfavorably by $3.4 million. The net unfavorable change includes a $5.4 million write off of certain communications hardware and capitalized costs during 2008 (see Capitalized Software Costs in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and a $1.2 million write off of redevelopment costs associated with a change in the planned use of a property during 2008. The net unfavorable change also reflects $3.6 million of income recognized in 2007 related to the transfer of certain property rights to an unrelated party. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in expenses of our self insurance activities (net of $2.8 million of costs in 2008 related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike) and a net decrease of $2.0 million in costs related to certain litigation matters. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, other expenses, net changed unfavorably by $3.6 million. The net unfavorable change is primarily attributable to our self insurance activities, including a $7.9 million increase in claims on our consolidated properties in excess of reimbursements from third parties, and the settlement of certain litigation matters which resulted in a $2.5 million unfavorable change during the year ended December 31, 2007. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes related to a $2.9 million charge recorded in 2006 related to the valuation of the High Performance Units (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and a $1.7 million charge for one time benefits to certain employees terminated in 2006 that did not recur in 2007. Other expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2007, also includes $3.6 million of income related to the transfer of certain property rights to an unrelated party. Restructuring Costs In connection with 2008 property sales and an expected reduction in redevelopment and transactional activities, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we initiated an organizational restructuring program that included reductions in workforce and related costs, reductions in leased corporate facilities and abandonment of certain redevelopment projects and business pursuits. As a result, we recognized a restructuring charge of $22.8 million ($20.5 million net of tax), which consists of: severance costs of $12.9 million; unrecoverable lease obligations and related costs of $6.4 million related to space that we will no longer use; and the write off of deferred transaction costs totaling $3.5 million associated with certain acquisitions and redevelopment opportunities that we will no longer pursue. No comparable restructuring costs were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006. 28 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, interest income decreased $23.8 million, or 58.1%. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of $16.0 million due to lower interest rates on notes receivable, cash and restricted cash balances and lower average balances. The decrease also includes the effect of a $5.8 million net adjustment to accretion on certain discounted notes during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from a change in the estimated timing and amount of collection, and $1.5 million of accretion income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007, related to the prepayment of principal on certain discounted loans collateralized by properties in West Harlem in New York City, which were funded in November 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, interest income increased $8.7 million, or 27.1%. This increase is primarily due to $5.9 million of interest income earned during 2007 on loans collateralized by properties in West Harlem in New York City, which were funded in November 2006, and an increase in interest income earned on escrowed funds related to a tax exempt bond financing transaction and certain property sales during 2007. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $13.3 million, or 3.7%. Interest on property loans payable increased $19.1 million due to higher balances resulting primarily from refinancing activities, offset by lower average interest rates. Interest expense also increased by $4.6 million due to decreases in capitalized interest related to redevelopment activities. These increases were partially offset by a $10.4 million decrease in corporate interest expense primarily due to lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $29.4 million, or 9.0%. Interest on property debt increased $32.5 million primarily due to higher balances resulting from refinancing activities and mortgage loans on newly acquired properties, offset by lower weighted average rates. Corporate interest increased by $3.1 million as a result of higher weighted average rates and a higher average balance during the year ended December 31, 2007. These increases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in capitalized interest related to increased levels of redevelopment and entitlement activities. Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners When real estate partnerships that are consolidated in our financial statements disburse cash to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the excess amount, even though there is no economic effect or cost. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, deficit distributions to minority partners increased $10.4 million. Deficit distributions to minority partners increased in 2008 partially due to $17.0 million in deficit distributions to minority interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, resulting from higher cash distributions associated with Aimco Operating Partnerships special distributions discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. This increase was partially offset by lower levels of distributions to minority interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in 2008, including distributions in connection with debt refinancing transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, deficit distributions to minority partners increased $17.1 million. This increase reflects higher levels of distributions to minority interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in 2007, including several large distributions in connection with debt refinancing transactions. 29 Table of Contents Provision for Operating Real Estate Impairment Losses Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, provision for operating real estate impairment losses increased by $4.0 million, from $1.6 million to $5.6 million. This increase is primarily attributed to a reduction in the estimated holding period for certain assets anticipated to sell within twelve months, but that did not otherwise meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, provision for operating real estate impairment losses increased by $2.4 million, from a recovery of $0.8 million in 2006 to a provision of $1.6 million in 2007. This increase is attributable to impairment losses recognized during 2007 on four properties classified as held for use relative to recoveries on previously recorded impairment losses recognized in 2006. Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the recent decline in land values in Southern California and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax). Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying value for the property exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008. As part of the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., we invested $50.0 million for a 20% passive interest in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to buy, re entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable and have been amortizing the discounted value of the investment to the $50.0 million previously estimated to be collectible through January 2, 2009, the initial dissolution date of the entity. The managing member is seeking to extend the dissolution date. In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements and as a result of the aforementioned decline in Southern California land values, we determined our recorded investment of $47.1 million is not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008. The impairments discussed above totaled $107.5 million and are included in provisions for impairment losses on real estate development assets in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in Item 8. We recognized no comparable impairments on real estate development assets during the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006. Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes our share of gains related to dispositions of real estate by unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other also includes a gain on extinguishment of debt. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined 30 Table of Contents on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $67.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to a $98.4 million net gain on the disposition of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships and a $1.7 million gain on the sale of an undeveloped land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2007, we recognized a $6.0 million non refundable option and extension fee resulting from the termination of rights under an option agreement to sell the North and Central towers of our Flamingo South Beach property, approximately $6.7 million of net gains on dispositions of land parcels and our share of gains on dispositions of properties by unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and a $19.4 million gain on debt extinguishment related to seven properties in the VMS partnership (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $4.3 million. This increase is primarily related to a $19.4 million gain on debt extinguishment related to seven properties in the VMS partnership (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), the recognition of a $6.0 million non refundable option and extension fee resulting from the termination of rights under an option agreement to sell the North and Central towers of our Flamingo South Beach property, and approximately $6.7 million of net gains on dispositions of land parcels and our share of gains on dispositions of properties by unconsolidated real estate partnerships in 2007, as compared to net gains of $27.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, on the sale of parcels of land, interests in unconsolidated real estate properties and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owned and operated several student housing properties. Income Tax Benefit Certain of our operations, such as property management, asset management and risk management, are conducted through, and certain of our properties are owned by, taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners, as these services and activities generally cannot be offered directly by the REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, income tax benefit increased by $33.5 million. This increase was primarily attributed to $36.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2008 related to the impairments of our Lincoln Place property and our investment in Casden Properties LLC, both of which are owned through TRS entities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, income tax benefit increased by $8.7 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in losses from continuing operations of our TRS entities, due largely to favorable results from our self insurance activities, which reduced losses of our TRS entities during 2006. Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This generally includes the minority partners share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. However, we generally do not recognize a benefit for the minority interest share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficits in partners equity. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed favorably by $20.9 million. The change includes a $9.1 million favorable change relating to the minority interest share of losses for real estate partnerships consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007, and the remainder relates to increases in the minority partners share of losses of our other consolidated real estate partnerships. 31 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships changed favorably by $13.6 million. This change is primarily attributable to our revised accounting treatment for tax credit arrangements (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) which resulted in the reversal in 2006 of a previously recognized benefit of $9.0 million for losses of tax credit partnerships that were allocated to minority interests in prior years, but which are absorbed by us under our revised accounting treatment. This favorable change was in addition to an increase in the minority interest partners share of losses of other consolidated real estate partnerships. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property, and any related minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $544.8 million, $83.1 million and $226.9 million, respectively. The $461.7 million increase in income from discontinued operations from 2007 to 2008 was principally due to a $515.3 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest and income taxes, a $31.2 million decrease in interest expense and a $36.3 million increase in recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners, partially offset by a $39.4 million decrease in operating income, a $19.1 million increase in real estate impairment losses, a $41.1 million increase in minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnership and a decrease of $22.8 million attributable to a 2007 gain on debt extinguishment related to eight properties in the VMS partnership. The $143.8 million decrease in income from discontinued operations from 2006 to 2007 was principally due to a $163.4 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest and income taxes, a $16.6 million decrease in recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners, a $12.0 million decrease in operating income and a $5.3 million increase in real estate impairment losses, partially offset by a $21.7 decrease in interest expense, a $15.7 million decrease in minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnership and an increase of $22.8 million attributable to a 2007 gain on debt extinguishment related to eight properties in the VMS partnership. During 2008, we sold 151 consolidated properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $578.2 million (which is net of $40.0 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $24.0 million in impairment losses on assets sold or classified as held for sale in 2008 and $30.1 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2007, we sold 73 consolidated properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $62.9 million (which is net of $2.1 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $4.9 million in impairment losses on assets sold or classified as held for sale in 2007 and $6.2 million of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2006, we sold 77 consolidated properties and the South Tower of the Flamingo South Beach property, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $226.3 million (which is net of $32.6 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $0.4 million in impairment recoveries on assets sold in 2006 and $10.4 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2008. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that 32 Table of Contents the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. From time to time, we have non revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. As discussed in Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets within the preceding discussion of Results of Operations, during 2008 we recognized impairment losses on our Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas properties of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax) and $5.7 million, respectively. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; availability and cost of financing; changes in market capitalization rates; and the relative illiquidity of such investments. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas discussed above and our investment in Casden Properties LLC discussed below, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded net impairment losses of $5.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to properties to be held and used. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded net recoveries of previously recorded impairment losses of $0.8 million. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. Notes receivable from non affiliates consist of notes receivable from unrelated third parties. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as 33 Table of Contents par value notes, and loans extended by predecessors, some of whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed transactions or has entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible amount of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods. Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $4.2 million, $4.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Additionally, as discussed in Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets within the preceding discussion of Results of Operations, during 2008 we recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) on our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which we account for as a note receivable. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $25.7 million, $30.8 million and $24.7 million of interest costs, respectively, and $78.1 million, $78.1 million and $66.2 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. 34 Table of Contents Funds From Operations FFO is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities, discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders(1) $ 361,755 $ (36,105 ) $ 95,655 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization(2) 458,595 403,786 368,783 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (18,012 ) (20,815 ) (22,898 ) Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners and unconsolidated entities(3)(4) (36,571 ) (22,277 ) 1,973 Depreciation of rental property related to minority partners interest adjustment(5) 7,377 Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other (99,602 ) (32,061 ) (27,730 ) Income tax arising from disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other (433 ) (17 ) Gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets and debt extinguishment gain 1,670 26,702 11,526 Deficit distributions to minority partners(6) 43,013 32,599 15,519 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of minority partners interest(3) (618,168 ) (65,076 ) (258,970 ) Depreciation of rental property, net of minority partners interest(3)(4) 50,786 65,334 107,545 Deficit distributions (recovery of deficit distributions) to minority partners, net(6) (30,127 ) 6,161 (10,441 ) Income tax arising from disposals 43,146 2,135 32,918 Minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments(7) 18,574 (36,830 ) (21,721 ) Preferred stock dividends 55,190 63,381 74,284 Preferred stock redemption related (gains) costs (1,482 ) 2,635 6,848 Funds From Operations $ 228,334 $ 389,552 $ 380,668 Preferred stock dividends (55,190 ) (63,381 ) (74,284 ) Preferred stock redemption related gains (costs) 1,482 (2,635 ) (6,848 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 4,850 1,875 202 Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 179,476 $ 325,411 $ 299,738 Weighted average number of common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding(8): Common shares and equivalents(9) 121,672 143,307 144,774 Dilutive preferred securities 2,314 856 105 Total 123,986 144,163 144,879 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for earnings per common share, calculated in accordance with GAAP. (2) Includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, we believe it is consistent with the White 35 Table of Contents Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry. (3) Minority partners interest, means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (4) Adjustments related to minority partners share of depreciation of rental property for the year ended December 31, 2007, include the subtraction of $15.1 million and $17.8 million for continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, related to the VMS debt extinguishment gains (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). These subtractions are required because we added back the minority partners share of depreciation related to rental property in determining FFO in prior periods. Accordingly, the net effect of the VMS debt extinguishment gains on our FFO for the year ended December 31, 2007, was an increase of $9.3 million ($8.4 million after Minority Interest in Aimco Operating Partnership). (5) Represents prior period depreciation of certain tax credit redevelopment properties that Aimco included in an adjustment to minority interest in real estate partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2006 (see Tax Credit Arrangements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). This prior period depreciation is added back to determine FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper. (6) In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners capital account, which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet. We record these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or (b) a payment related to the non controlling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. (7) During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Aimco Operating Partnership had 7,191,199, 7,367,440 and 7,853,174 common OP Units outstanding and 2,367,629, 2,379,084 and 2,379,084 High Performance Units outstanding. (8) Weighted average common shares, common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities amounts for the periods presented have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the special dividends paid during 2008 and in January 2009, which are further discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. (9) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We may use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. 36 Table of Contents The current state of credit markets and related effect on the overall economy may have an adverse affect on our liquidity, both through increases in interest rates and credit risk spreads, and access to financing. As further discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we are subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate liabilities, preferred stock and assets. Based on our net variable rate liabilities, preferred stock and assets outstanding at December 31, 2008, we estimate that a 1.0% increase in 30 day LIBOR with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our income attributable to common stockholders by approximately $4.3 million on an annual basis. From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, both the SIFMA (previously the Bond Market Association index) and 30 day LIBOR rates, the predominant interest rates to which our variable rate debt obligations are indexed, decreased, with the SIFMA rate decreasing from 3.06% to 1.25% and the 30 day LIBOR rate decreasing from 4.57% to 0.45%. Although base interest rates have decreased, the tightening of credit markets has affected the credit risk spreads charged over base interest rates on, and the availability of, mortgage loan financing. For future refinancing activities, our liquidity and cost of funds may be affected by increases in base interest rates or higher credit risk spreads. If timely property financing options are not available for maturing debt, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in certain capital spending or proceeds from asset dispositions. From time to time, we enter into total rate of return swaps on various fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds payable and fixed rate notes payable to convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower our cost of borrowing. In exchange for our receipt of a fixed rate generally equal to the underlying borrowings interest rate, the total rate of return swaps require that we pay a variable rate, equivalent to the SIFMA rate for tax exempt bonds payable and the 30 day LIBOR rate for notes payable, plus a credit risk spread. These swaps generally have a second or third lien on the property collateralized by the related borrowings and the obligations under certain of these swaps are cross collateralized with certain of the other swaps with a particular counterparty. The total rate of return swaps require specified loan to value ratios. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which would adversely affect our cash flows. The underlying borrowings are generally callable at our option, with no prepayment penalty, with 30 days advance notice, and the swaps generally have a term of less than five years. At December 31, 2008, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions totaling $422.1 million and had provided $3.2 million in cash collateral pursuant to the swap agreements to satisfy the loan to value ratio requirements. The total rate of return swaps have a contractually defined termination value generally equal to the difference between the fair value and the counterpartys purchased value of the underlying borrowings (which is typically par value or contract value), which may require payment by us if the fair value is less than the purchased value, or to us if the fair value exceeds the purchased value. In the event we are unable to extend the arrangements at their maturities, the counterparty, who is also the creditor on the related borrowings, may desire to sell the borrowings. If the counterpartys purchased value of the underlying borrowings exceeds the fair value of the underlying borrowings at the date of the swap maturities, we may elect to purchase the borrowings at counterpartys purchased value to avoid incurring a termination payment under the swap arrangements. In such event, we would be required to refinance the borrowings or find other sources of liquidity to repay the borrowings. We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. At the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure. In the event a counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely affect our operating cash flows. See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of these arrangements, including the current swap maturity dates. As of December 31, 2008, the amount available under our revolving credit facility was $578.8 million. For the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010, we have non recourse property debt maturities of $288.0 million and $284.7 million, respectively, at an average estimated loan to value of approximately 52% and 51%, respectively. Our total outstanding unsecured term debt of $400.0 million at December 31, 2008, matures in March 2011. In January 2009, we prepaid $50.0 million of the balance outstanding on the unsecured term debt. Additionally, we have limited obligations to fund redevelopment commitments during the year ending December 31, 2009, and no development commitments. 37 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, we had $299.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $89.2 million from December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, we had $258.3 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by operating activities of $421.5 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $44.1 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, driven primarily by a $48.3 million decrease in operating income of our consolidated properties, including those classified in discontinued operations, which was attributable to property sales in 2008 and 2007. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by investing activities of $1.3 billion consisted primarily of proceeds from disposition of real estate and interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, partially offset by capital expenditures and purchases of real estate. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 151 consolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $2.4 billion and generated proceeds totaling $2.3 billion, after the payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties. The $2.3 billion in proceeds is inclusive of promote income which is generated by the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures, debt assumed by buyers and sales proceeds placed into escrows for tax free exchanges and other purposes, all of which are excluded from proceeds from disposition of real estate in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Sales proceeds were used to repay property debt, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repurchase shares of our Common Stock and preferred stock and for other corporate purposes. Our portfolio management strategy includes property acquisitions and dispositions to concentrate our portfolio in our target markets. We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with this long term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with this strategy but offer attractive returns. We plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund acquisitions, and for other operating needs and corporate purposes. Capital Expenditures We classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties, redevelopment or entitlement. Expenditures other than casualty, redevelopment and entitlement capital expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property. CR represents the share of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the portion of acquired capital assets that was consumed during the period we have owned the asset. CI represents the share of expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset as compared to its original purchase condition. CR and CI exclude capital expenditures for casualties, redevelopment and entitlements. Casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property. Entitlement expenditures represent costs incurred in connection with obtaining local governmental approvals to increase density and add residential units to a site. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we spent a total of $101.4 million, 38 Table of Contents $124.9 million, $22.8 million, $340.3 million and $24.2 million on CR, CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement, respectively. The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlements for the year ended December 31, 2008, on a per unit and total dollar basis. Per unit numbers for CR and CI are based on approximately 126,834 average units for the year, including 109,956 conventional units and 16,879 affordable units. Average units are weighted for the portion of the period that we owned an interest in the property, represent ownership adjusted effective units, and exclude non managed units. Total capital expenditures are reconciled to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Aimcos Share of Expenditures Per Effective Unit Capital Replacements Detail: Building and grounds $ 40,516 $ 319 Turnover related 45,724 361 Capitalized site payroll and indirect costs 15,128 119 Our share of Capital Replacements $ 101,368 $ 799 Capital Replacements: Conventional $ 94,574 $ 860 Affordable 6,794 $ 403 Our share of Capital Replacements 101,368 $ 799 Capital Improvements: Conventional 113,870 $ 1,036 Affordable 11,016 $ 653 Our share of Capital Improvements 124,886 $ 985 Casualties(1): Conventional 21,228 Affordable 1,615 Our share of casualties 22,843 Redevelopment: Conventional projects 226,307 Tax credit projects 113,945 Our share of redevelopment 340,252 Entitlement 24,156 Our share of capital expenditures 613,505 Plus minority partners share of consolidated spending 52,504 Less our share of unconsolidated spending (776 ) Total capital expenditures per consolidated statement of cash flows $ 665,233 (1) Casualties for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflect the portion of the anticipated spending related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike incurred as of December 31, 2008. Included in the above spending for CI, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement, was approximately $63.1 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2008. 39 Table of Contents We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital and property sales as discussed below. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used in financing activities of $1.7 billion was primarily attributed to debt principal payments, distributions to minority interests, payment of common and preferred dividends and repurchases of Common Stock and preferred stock. Proceeds from property loans and tax exempt bond financing partially offset the cash outflows. Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $6.3 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding, which included $52.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, of mortgage debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 71 properties (including one unconsolidated property) generating $962.2 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.51%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $430.9 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt primarily as a means of extending current and near term maturities. Term Loans and Credit Facility We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. In September 2008, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Facility that modifies certain provisions related to letters of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repaid in full our $75.0 million term loan which was due for payment in September 2009. Following this repayment, the aggregate amount of commitments and loans under the Credit Agreement is $1.035 billion, comprised of a $400.0 million term loan and $635.0 million of revolving loan commitments. The $635.0 million of revolving loan commitments is after the elimination of a $15.0 million commitment held by Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. The $400.0 million term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, or at our option, a base rate equal to the prime rate, and matures March 2011. Our revolving credit facility matures May 2009, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to a 20.0 basis point fee on the total commitments. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (currently at LIBOR plus 1.125%). At December 31, 2008, the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $400.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 2.94%. In January 2009, we prepaid $50.0 million of the outstanding balance on the term debt. The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2008, was $578.8 million (after giving effect to $56.2 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. Fair Value Measurements We enter into total rate of return swaps on various fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds payable and fixed rate notes payable to convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower our cost of borrowing. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS 133, we designate total rate of return swaps as hedges of the risk of overall changes in the fair value of the underlying borrowings. At each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of these borrowings and the total rate of return swaps and recognize any changes therein as an adjustment of interest expense. Our method used to calculate the fair value of the total rate of return swaps generally results in changes in fair value that are equal to the changes in fair value of the related borrowings, which is consistent with our hedging strategy. We believe that these financial instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value of the 40 Table of Contents related borrowings during the hedging period, and accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments have no material impact on our liquidity, results of operations or capital resources. During the year ended December 31, 2008, changes in the fair values of these financial instruments resulted in decreases of $20.1 million in the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings and equal increases in accrued liabilities and other for total rate of return swaps. At December 31, 2008, the cumulative recognized changes in the fair value of these financial instruments resulted in a $29.5 million reduction in the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings offset by an equal increase in accrued liabilities and other for total rate of return swaps. The current and cumulative decreases in the fair values of the hedged borrowings and related swaps reflect the recent uncertainty in the credit markets which has decreased demand and increased pricing for similar debt instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we received net cash receipts of $16.7 million under the total return swaps, which positively impacted our liquidity. To the extent interest rates increase above the fixed rates on the underlying borrowings, our obligations under the total return swaps will negatively affect our liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we provided $3.2 million of cash collateral to satisfy certain loan to value requirements under the total rate of return swap agreements, which negatively affected our liquidity. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which would adversely affect our liquidity. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information on our total rate of return swaps and related borrowings. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid cash dividends totaling $55.2 million and $212.3 million to preferred and common stockholders, respectively. Additionally, pursuant to the special dividends discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends totaling $489.8 million to common stockholders through the issuance of approximately 22.9 million shares. During September 2008, we repurchased 54 shares, or $27.0 million in liquidation preference, of our Series A Community Reinvestment Act Perpetual Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, for cash totaling $24.8 million. In April 2008, we and the Aimco Operating Partnership filed a new shelf registration statement to replace the existing shelf (which was due to expire later in 2008) that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership. Our Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately 13.9 million shares of Common Stock (19.3 million shares after the effect of the special dividend) for approximately $473.5 million. As of December 31, 2008, we were authorized to repurchase approximately 19.3 million additional shares of our Common Stock under an authorization that has no expiration date. Future repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Less than More than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Scheduled long term debt maturities $ 6,377,121 $ 407,893 $ 718,724 $ 1,094,021 $ 4,156,483 Term loan(1) 400,000 400,000 Redevelopment and other construction commitments 70,279 68,752 1,527 Leases for space occupied(2) 31,935 7,904 12,316 7,622 4,093 Other obligations(3) 5,595 5,595 Total $ 6,884,930 $ 490,144 $ 1,132,567 $ 1,101,643 $ 4,160,576 (1) After payment of $50.0 million in January 2009, the term loan had an outstanding balance of $350.0 million. (2) Inclusive of leased space that has been abandoned as part of our organizational restructuring in 2008 (see Restructuring Costs in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). (3) Represents a commitment to fund $5.6 million in second mortgage loans on certain properties in West Harlem, New York City. In addition, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects, capital improvements and capital replacement principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows. In 2009, inclusive of the redevelopment commitments discussed in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to invest between $50.0 and $75.0 million in conventional redevelopment projects and between $30.0 and $45.0 million in affordable redevelopment projects, predominantly funded by third party tax credit equity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than 1% up to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary or to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in base interest rates, mortgage spreads and availability of credit. We are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk, or any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid 42 Table of Contents the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We use total rate of return swaps to obtain the benefit of variable rates on certain of our fixed rate debt instruments. We make limited use of other derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. We had $1,309.5 million of floating rate debt and $73.0 million of floating rate preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2008. Of the total floating rate debt, the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing ($563.4 million), floating rate secured notes ($335.6 million) and a term loan ($400.0 million). At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $717.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and notes receivable, the majority of which bear interest. We also had approximately $127.3 million of variable rate debt associated with our redevelopment activities, for which we capitalize a portion of the interest expense. The effect of our interest bearing assets and of capitalizing interest on variable rate debt associated with our redevelopment activities would partially reduce the effect of an increase in variable interest rates. Historically, changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than 1:1 with changes in taxable interest rates. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the SIFMA rate (previously the Bond Market Association index), which since 1989 has averaged 69% of the 30 day LIBOR rate. If this historical relationship continues, on an annual basis, we estimate that an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 1.0% (0.69% in tax exempt interest rates) with constant credit risk spreads would result in our income before minority interests being reduced by $3.1 million and our income attributable to common stockholders being reduced by $4.3 million. We estimate the fair value for our debt instruments using present value techniques that include income and market valuation approaches with market rates for debt with the same or similar terms. Present value calculations vary depending on the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In many cases, the fair value estimates may not be realizable in immediate settlement of the instruments. The estimated aggregate fair value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $6.7 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The combined carrying value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $6.8 billion and $7.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details on our consolidated debt. Refer to Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding certain of our fixed rate debt that is subject to total rate of return swap instruments. If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 1.0% with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our debt discussed above would have decreased from $6.7 billion to $6.4 billion. If market rates for our debt discussed above were lower by 1.0% with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. At December 31, 2008, we had swap positions with two financial institutions totaling $422.1 million. The related swap agreements provide for collateral calls to maintain specified loan to value ratios, pursuant to which we had provided $3.2 million of collateral as of December 31, 2008. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which would adversely affect our cash flows.
