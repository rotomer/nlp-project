Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our stockholders. Our business plan to achieve this objective is to: own and operate a broadly diversified portfolio of primarily class B/B+ assets with properties concentrated in the 20 largest markets in the United States (as measured by total apartment value, which is the estimated total market value of apartment properties in a particular market); improve our portfolio by selling assets with lower projected returns and reinvesting those proceeds through the purchase of new assets or additional investment in existing assets in our portfolio, including increased ownership or redevelopment; and provide financial leverage primarily by the use of non recourse, long dated, fixed rate property debt and perpetual preferred equity. Our owned real estate portfolio includes 219 conventional properties with 68,972 units and 228 affordable properties with 26,540 units. Our conventional and affordable properties comprise 88% and 12%, respectively, of our total property Net Asset Value. For the three months ended December 31, 2010, our conventional portfolio monthly rents averaged $1,052 and provided 62% operating margins. These average rents increased from $1,042 for the three months ended December 31, 2009. Notwithstanding the economic challenges of the last several years, our diversified portfolio of conventional and affordable properties generated improved property operating results from 2007 to 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the net operating income of our same store properties and total real estate operations increased by 1.2% and 5.8%, respectively. We continue to work toward simplifying our business, including de emphasizing transaction based activity fees and, as a result, reducing the cost of personnel involved in those activities. Revenues from transactional activities decreased from $68.2 million during 2008 to $7.9 million during 2010, and during 2010 transactional activities generated approximately 3.0% of our Pro forma Funds From Operations (defined below). Additionally, we have reduced our offsite costs by $16.8 million. Our 2010, 2009 and 2008 results are discussed in the Results of Operations section below. We upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the sale of assets with lower projected returns, which are often in markets less desirable than our target markets, and reinvest these proceeds through the purchase of new assets or additional investment in existing assets in our portfolio, through increased ownership or redevelopment. We prefer the redevelopment of select properties in our existing portfolio to ground up development, as we believe it provides superior risk adjusted returns with lower volatility. Our leverage strategy focuses on increasing financial returns while minimizing risk. At December 31, 2010, approximately 86% of our leverage consisted of property level, non recourse, long dated, fixed rate, amortizing debt and 13% consisted of perpetual preferred equity, a combination which helps to limit our refunding and re pricing risk. At December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding corporate level debt. Our leverage strategy limits refunding risk on our property level debt. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average maturity of our property level debt was 7.8 years, with 2% of our debt maturing in 2011, less than 9% maturing in 2012, and on average approximately 7% maturing in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Long duration, fixed rate liabilities provide a hedge against increases in interest rates and inflation. Approximately 91% of our property level debt is fixed rate. Of the $104.9 million of property debt maturing during 2011, we completed the refinance of $79.4 million in February 2011, and we are focusing on refinancing our property debt maturing during 2012 through 2015 to extend maturities and lock in current low interest rates. 21 Table of Contents During 2010, we repaid the remaining $90.0 million on our term loan. We also expanded our credit facility from $180.0 million to $300.0 million, providing additional liquidity for short term or unexpected cash requirements. As of December 31, 2010, we had the capacity to borrow $260.3 million pursuant to our credit facility (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2013, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions. The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Net Asset Value; Pro forma Funds From Operations, which is Funds From Operations excluding operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts; Adjusted Funds From Operations, which is Pro forma Funds From Operations less spending for Capital Replacements; property net operating income, which is rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes; proportionate property net operating income, which reflects our share of property net operating income of our consolidated and unconsolidated properties; same store property operating results; Free Cash Flow, which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; Free Cash Flow internal rate of return; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Funds From Operations is defined and further described in the section captioned Funds From Operations. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: household formations; rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; interest rates; and availability and cost of financing. Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings. Highlights of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, are summarized below: Average daily occupancy for our Conventional Same Store properties increased 200 basis points, from 94.1% in 2009 to 96.1% in 2010. Conventional Same Store revenues and expenses for 2010, decreased by 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively, as compared to 2009, resulting in a 0.2% increase in net operating income. Total Same Store revenues and expenses for 2010 increased by 0.2% and decreased by 0.8%, respectively, as compared to 2009, resulting in a 0.8% increase in net operating income. Net operating income for our real estate portfolio (continuing operations) increased 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009. Property sales declined in 2010 as compared to 2009, as property sales completed through July 2010 allowed us to fully repay the remainder of our term debt. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Results of Operations Overview 2010 compared to 2009 We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $71.7 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, increases of $7.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively. These increases in net loss were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate due to fewer property sales in 2010 as compared to 2009; and 22 Table of Contents a decrease in asset management and tax credit revenues, primarily due to decreased amortization of deferred tax credit income and a de emphasis on transaction based fees. The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by: an increase in net operating income of our properties included in continuing operations, reflecting improved operations; a decrease in provisions for losses on notes receivable, primarily due to the impairment during 2009 of our interest in Casden Properties; and a decrease in earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, primarily due to their share of the decrease in gains on disposition of consolidated real estate properties as discussed above. 2009 compared to 2008 We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to net income attributable to Aimco of $412.0 million and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $351.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreases of $476.3 million and $466.1 million, respectively. These decreases in net income were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below: a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate due to fewer property sales in 2009 as compared to 2008; a decrease in gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other, primarily due to a large gain on the sale of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership in 2008; an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to completed redevelopments and capital additions placed in service for partial periods during 2008 or 2009; and a decrease in asset management and tax credit revenues, primarily due to a reduction in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures. The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by: a decrease in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to reductions in personnel and related expenses from our organizational restructuring activities during 2008 and 2009; impairment losses on real estate development assets in 2008, for which no similar impairments were recognized in 2009; and a decrease in earnings allocable to noncontrolling interests, primarily due to a decrease in the noncontrolling interests share of the decrease in gains on sales discussed above. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Real Estate Operations Our real estate portfolio is comprised of two business components: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations, which also represent our two reportable segments. Our conventional real estate portfolio consists of market rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and includes 219 properties with 68,972 units. Our affordable real estate portfolio consists of 228 properties with 26,540 units, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Our conventional and affordable properties contributed 87% and 13%, respectively, of proportionate property net operating income amounts during the year ended December 31, 2010. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we consolidate certain properties in which we hold an insignificant economic interest and in some cases we do not consolidate other properties in which we have a significant economic interest. Due to the diversity of our economic ownership interests in our properties, our chief operating decision maker emphasizes proportionate property net 23 Table of Contents operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis. We do not include property management revenues and expenses or casualty related amounts in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. The effects of these items on our real estate operations results are discussed below on a consolidated basis, that is, before adjustments for noncontrolling interests or our interest in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. The tables and discussions below reflect the proportionate results of our conventional and affordable segments and the consolidated results related to our real estate operations not allocated to segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands). The tables and discussions below exclude the results of operations for properties included in discontinued operations as of December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 17 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reporting segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses. Conventional Real Estate Operations Our conventional segment consists of conventional properties we classify as same store, redevelopment and other conventional properties. Same store properties are properties we manage and that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy during the current and prior year comparable period. Redevelopment properties are those in which a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or for which other significant non unit renovations are underway or have been complete for less than one year. Other conventional properties may include conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, acquisition properties, university housing properties and properties that are not multifamily, such as commercial properties or fitness centers. Our definitions of same store and redevelopment properties may result in these populations differing for the purpose of comparing 2010 to 2009 results and 2009 to 2008 results. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Conventional same store $ 641,282 $ 642,784 $ (1,502 ) (0.2 )% Conventional redevelopment 113,273 107,461 5,812 5.4 % Other Conventional 71,414 70,065 1,349 1.9 % Total 825,969 820,310 5,659 0.7 % Property operating expenses: Conventional same store 247,658 250,062 (2,404 ) (1.0 )% Conventional redevelopment 40,915 42,206 (1,291 ) (3.1 )% Other Conventional 34,689 33,990 699 2.1 % Total 323,262 326,258 (2,996 ) (0.9 )% Property net operating income: Conventional same store 393,624 392,722 902 0.2 % Conventional redevelopment 72,358 65,255 7,103 10.9 % Other Conventional 36,725 36,075 650 1.8 % Total $ 502,707 $ 494,052 $ 8,655 1.8 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, our conventional segments proportionate property net operating income increased $8.7 million, or 1.8%. 24 Table of Contents Conventional same store net operating income increased by $0.9 million. This increase was attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in expense primarily due to a reduction during 2010 of previously estimated real estate tax obligations resulting from successful appeals settled during the period, and decreases in marketing expenses and unit turn costs, partially offset by increases in contract services, insurance and administrative costs. This decrease in expense was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in revenue, primarily due to lower average rent (approximately $34 per unit). The decrease in average rent was partially offset by a 200 basis point increase in average physical occupancy and higher utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2010, were 2.3% lower than expiring lease rates and renewal rates were 1.5% higher than expiring lease rates. The net operating income of our conventional redevelopment properties increased by $7.1 million, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in revenue resulting from higher average physical occupancy and an increase in utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income, and a $1.3 million reduction in expense primarily related to marketing expenses, partially offset by higher insurance. Our other conventional net operating income increased by $0.7 million, primarily due to increases in both revenue and expense of approximately 2.0%. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Conventional same store $ 585,501 $ 600,907 $ (15,406 ) (2.6 )% Conventional redevelopment 165,480 153,983 11,497 7.5 % Other Conventional 69,329 68,126 1,203 1.8 % Total 820,310 823,016 (2,706 ) (0.3 )% Property operating expenses: Conventional same store 226,572 225,694 878 0.4 % Conventional redevelopment 65,996 65,111 885 1.4 % Other Conventional 33,690 31,527 2,163 6.9 % Total 326,258 322,332 3,926 1.2 % Property net operating income: Conventional same store 358,929 375,213 (16,284 ) (4.3 )% Conventional redevelopment 99,484 88,872 10,612 11.9 % Other Conventional 35,639 36,599 (960 ) (2.6 )% Total $ 494,052 $ 500,684 $ (6,632 ) (1.3 )% For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, our conventional segments proportionate property net operating income decreased $6.6 million, or 1.3%. Our conventional same store net operating income decreased $16.3 million, or 4.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $15.4 million decrease in revenue, primarily due to a 2.5% decline in rental rates and a 90 basis point decrease in occupancy, partially offset by an increase in utility reimbursements and miscellaneous income. The decrease was also attributable to a $0.9 million increase in expense, primarily due to higher insurance and personnel costs, partially offset by lower administrative costs. Conventional redevelopment net operating income increased by $10.6 million, primarily due to an $11.5 million increase in revenue. Revenue increased due to more units in service at these properties during 2009 and an increase in utility reimbursements and miscellaneous income. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in expense, primarily related to higher real estate taxes, partially offset by lower administrative costs. 25 Table of Contents Our other conventional net operating income decreased by $0.9 million, primarily due to a 6.9% increase in expenses partially offset by a 1.8% increase in revenues. Affordable Real Estate Operations Our affordable segment consists of properties we classify as same store or other (primarily redevelopment properties). Our criteria for classifying affordable properties as same store or redevelopment are consistent with those for our conventional properties described above. Our definitions of same store and redevelopment properties may result in these populations differing for the purpose of comparing 2010 to 2009 results and 2009 to 2008 results. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Affordable same store $ 116,852 $ 113,853 $ 2,999 2.6 % Other Affordable 13,710 12,695 1,015 8.0 % Total 130,562 126,548 4,014 3.2 % Property operating expenses: Affordable same store 53,121 53,057 64 0.1 % Other Affordable 5,519 5,998 (479 ) (8.0 )% Total 58,640 59,055 (415 ) (0.7 )% Property net operating income: Affordable same store 63,731 60,796 2,935 4.8 % Other Affordable 8,191 6,697 1,494 22.3 % Total $ 71,922 $ 67,493 $ 4,429 6.6 % The proportionate property net operating income of our affordable segment increased $4.4 million, or 6.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009. Affordable same store net operating income increased by $2.9 million, primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in revenue due to higher average rent ($7 per unit) and higher average physical occupancy (18 basis points). The net operating income of our other affordable properties increased by $1.5 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue driven by higher average rent ($23 per unit) and higher average occupancy. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Affordable same store $ 113,853 $ 109,483 $ 4,370 4.0 % Other Affordable 12,695 12,209 486 4.0 % Total 126,548 121,692 4,856 4.0 % Property operating expenses: Affordable same store 53,057 52,975 82 0.2 % Other Affordable 5,998 6,048 (50 ) (0.8 )% Total 59,055 59,023 32 0.1 % Property net operating income: Affordable same store 60,796 56,508 4,288 7.6 % Other Affordable 6,697 6,161 536 8.7 % Total $ 67,493 $ 62,669 $ 4,824 7.7 % 26 Table of Contents Our affordable segment proportionate property net operating income increased $4.8 million, or 7.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008. Affordable same store net operating income increased $4.3 million, primarily due to increased revenue. Affordable same store revenue increased by $4.4 million, primarily due to higher average rent ($29 per unit), partially offset by lower average physical occupancy (56 basis points). The net operating income of our other affordable properties increased by $0.5 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues due to higher average rent ($43 per unit), partially offset by lower average occupancy. The increase in revenues was partially offset by an increase in expenses. Non Segment Real Estate Operations Real estate operations net operating income amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include property management revenues and expenses and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, property management revenues decreased by $2.2 million, from $5.1 million to $2.9 million, primarily due to the elimination of revenues related to properties consolidated during 2010 in connection with our adoption of revised accounting guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments, including property management expenses and casualty losses, decreased by $3.2 million. Property management expenses decreased by $3.0 million, from $51.2 million to $48.2 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities and casualty losses decreased by $0.2 million, from $9.8 million to $9.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, property management revenues decreased by $1.3 million, from $6.4 million to $5.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in the number of managed properties due to asset sales. For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments decreased by $16.5 million. Property management expenses decreased by $16.6 million, from $67.8 million to $51.2 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities, and casualty losses increased by $0.1 million. Asset Management and Tax Credit Revenues We perform activities and services for consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $14.3 million. This decrease is attributable to an $8.7 million decrease in income related to our affordable housing tax credit syndication business. Approximately $3.8 million of this decrease is due to the delivery of historic credits during 2009 for which no comparable credits were delivered during 2010, and the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in amortization of deferred tax credit income. Asset management and tax credit revenues also decreased due to a $2.0 million decrease in current asset management fees due to the elimination of fees on newly consolidated properties, for which the benefit of these fees is now included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, a $1.9 million decrease in disposition and other fees we earn in connection with transactional activities, and a $1.7 million decrease in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $49.0 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $42.8 million decrease in promote income due to fewer sales of joint venture assets in 2009, a $7.6 million decrease in other general partner transactional fees, and a $2.2 million decrease in asset management fees, partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in revenues related to our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements. 27 Table of Contents Investment Management Expenses Investment management expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel that perform asset management and tax credit activities. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, investment management expenses decreased $1.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $4.3 million reduction in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings, partially offset by a $3.0 million net increase in expenses, primarily related to our write off of previously deferred costs related to tax credit projects we recently abandoned. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, investment management expenses decreased $9.0 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and a reduction in transaction costs, which in 2008 include the retrospective application of SFAS 141(R). Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization decreased $1.6 million, or 0.4%. This decrease was primarily due to depreciation adjustments recognized in 2009 to reduce the carrying amount of certain properties. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation primarily related to properties we consolidated during 2010 based on our adoption of revised accounting guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $51.2 million, or 13.6%. This increase primarily consists of depreciation related to properties acquired during the latter part of 2008, completed redevelopments and other capital projects placed in service in the latter part of 2009. Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the decline in land values in Southern California during 2008 and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax). Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008. The impairments discussed above totaled $91.1 million and are included in provisions for impairment losses on real estate development assets in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in Item 8. We recognized no similar impairments on real estate development assets during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 5.8%. This decrease is primarily attributable to net reductions in personnel and related expenses, partially offset by an increase in information technology outsourcing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, general and administrative expenses decreased $23.7 million, or 29.5%. This decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in personnel and related expenses associated with our organizational restructurings (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), pursuant to which we eliminated approximately 400, or 36%, of our offsite positions between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. 28 Table of Contents As a result of our restructuring activities, our general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 6.8% in 2008, to 5.0% in 2009 and 4.7% in 2010. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, other expenses, net decreased by $5.0 million. During 2009, we settled certain litigation matters resulting in a net expense in our operations, and in 2010 we settled certain litigation matters that resulted in a net gain in our operations. The effect of the expense in 2009 and gain in 2010 resulted in a $14.8 million decrease in other expenses, net from 2009 to 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of our insurance (net of a reduction in the number of properties insured from 2009 to 2010). For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, other expenses, net decreased by $6.8 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $5.4 million write off during 2008 of certain communications hardware and capitalized costs in 2008, and a $5.3 million reduction in expenses of our self insurance activities, including a decrease in casualty losses on less than wholly owned properties from 2008 to 2009. These decreases are partially offset by an increase of $4.8 million in costs related to certain litigation matters. Restructuring Costs For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized restructuring costs of $11.2 million, as compared to $22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, related to our organizational restructurings, which are further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized no similar restructuring costs. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion may occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income increased $2.0 million, or 22.4%. Interest income increased during 2010 primarily due to an increase of accretion income related to a change in timing and amount of collection for certain of our discounted notes, including several notes that were repaid in advance of their maturity dates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income decreased $10.5 million, or 53.5%. Interest income decreased by $8.7 million due to lower interest rates on notes receivable, cash and restricted cash balances and lower average balances and by $4.1 million due to a decrease in accretion income related to our note receivable from Casden Properties LLC for which we ceased accretion following impairment of the note in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accretion income related to other notes during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from a change in the timing and amount of collection. Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $0.9 million, $21.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively. The provisions for losses on notes receivable for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, primarily consist of impairments related to our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which are discussed further below. As further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have an investment in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. 29 Table of Contents Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable. In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements and as a result of a decline in land values in Southern California, we determined our recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the preparation of our 2009 annual financial statements and as a result of continued declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our then recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2009. In addition to the impairments related to Casden Properties LLC discussed above, we recognized provisions for losses on notes receivable totaling $0.9 million, $0.8 million and $1.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased by less than $0.1 million. Property related interest expense increased by $7.6 million, due to a $3.3 million increase related to properties newly consolidated in 2010 (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our adoption of ASU 2009 17) and an increase related to properties refinanced with higher average outstanding balances, partially offset by lower average rates. The increase in property related interest expense was substantially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in corporate interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance on our term loan, which we repaid during July 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense increased $1.1 million, or 0.3%. Property related interest expense increased by $20.5 million, primarily due to a $14.2 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in redevelopment during 2009, and an increase of $5.1 million related to properties refinanced with higher average rates, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances during 2009. The increase in property related interest expense was offset by a $19.4 million decrease in corporate interest expense, primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and lower average rates during 2009. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships includes our share of net losses of our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and may include impairment losses, gains or losses on the disposition of real estate assets or depreciation expense which generally exceeds the net operating income recognized by such unconsolidated partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $11.7 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, certain of our consolidated investment partnerships, including those we consolidated in 2010 in connection with our adoption of ASU 2009 17, reduced by $9.8 million their investment balances related to unconsolidated low income housing tax credit partnerships based on a reduction in the remaining tax credits to be delivered. This increase in equity in losses was in addition to an increase in equity in losses from real estate operations due to an increase in the number of unconsolidated partnerships, resulting from our consolidation during 2010 of additional investment partnerships that hold investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These losses had an insignificant effect on net loss attributable to Aimco during 2010 as substantially all of the results of these consolidated investment partnerships are attributed to the noncontrolling interests in these entities. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $6.7 million. The increase in our equity in losses from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to our sale in late 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership that generated $3.0 million of equity in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2008, and our sale during 2009 of our interest in an unconsolidated group purchasing organization which resulted in a decrease of equity in earnings of approximately $1.2 million. 30 Table of Contents Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and certain costs related to asset disposal activities. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $10.9 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to $8.6 million of additional proceeds received in 2009 related to our disposition during 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership and a $4.0 million gain from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization during 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $75.8 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a net gain of $98.4 million on our disposition in 2008 of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships. This decrease was partially offset by $18.7 million of gains on the disposition of interests in unconsolidated partnerships during 2009. Gains recognized in 2009 consist of $8.6 million related to our receipt in 2009 of additional proceeds related to our disposition during 2008 of one of the partnership interests discussed above (see Note 3 to the consolidated financials statements in Item 8), $4.0 million from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), and $6.1 million from our disposition in 2009 of interests in several unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Income Tax Benefit Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk management are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax benefit increased by $0.9 million, from $17.5 million to $18.4 million. This increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to increased losses of our TRS entities, and was substantially offset by the $8.1 million tax benefit we recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties, LLC, for which no similar benefit was recognized in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, income tax benefit decreased by $39.1 million. This decrease was primarily attributed to $36.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2008 related to the impairments of our Lincoln Place property and our investment in Casden Properties LLC, both of which are owned through TRS entities, partially offset by $8.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties LLC. The decrease in tax benefit from 2008 to 2009 related to these impairment losses was in addition to a decrease in tax benefit primarily due to larger losses by our TRS entities during 2008 as compared to 2009, including restructuring costs incurred in 2008 and a reduction in personnel and other costs in 2009 as a result of the organizational restructurings. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest 31 Table of Contents expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, income from discontinued operations totaled $76.3 million and $156.8 million, respectively. The $80.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $129.9 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2010 as compared to 2009, partially offset by a $21.0 million decrease in operating loss (inclusive of a $41.9 million decrease in real estate impairment losses) and a $34.9 million decrease in interest expense. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, income from discontinued operations totaled $156.8 million and $744.9 million, respectively. The $588.1 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $541.1 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2009 as compared to 2008, and a $112.8 million decrease in operating income (inclusive of a $27.1 million increase in real estate impairment losses), partially offset by a $59.8 million decrease in interest expense and a $44.9 million increase in income tax benefit for 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 51 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $401.4 million and net proceeds of $118.4 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $86.1 million (which is net of $8.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 89 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $1.3 billion and net proceeds of $432.7 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $216.0 million (which is net of $5.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 151 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $2.4 billion and net proceeds of $1.1 billion, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $757.1 million (which is net of $43.1 million of related income taxes). For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2010. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations). Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the non Aimco partners, or noncontrolling partners, share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships, as well as the noncontrolling partners share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts that we charge to such partnerships. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 160, which are now codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic 810, effective January 1, 2009. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 160, we generally did not recognize a benefit for the noncontrolling interest partners share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances and we generally recognized a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that had deficit noncontrolling interest balances. Under the updated provisions of FASB ASC Topic 810, we are required to attribute losses to noncontrolling interests even if such attribution would result in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance and we are no longer required to recognize a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we allocated net losses of $13.3 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships as compared to net income of $22.5 million allocated to these noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2009, a variance of $35.8 million. This change was substantially 32 Table of Contents attributed to a decrease in the noncontrolling interest partners share of income from discontinued operations, which decreased primarily due to a reduction in gains on the dispositions of real estate from 2009 to 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, net earnings attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased by $133.2 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of $108.7 million related to the noncontrolling interest partners share of gains on dispositions of real estate, due primarily to fewer sales in 2009 as compared to 2008, $5.5 million of losses allocated to noncontrolling interests in 2009 that we would not have allocated to the noncontrolling interest partners in 2008 because to do so would have resulted in deficits in their noncontrolling interest balances, and approximately $3.8 million related to deficit distribution charges recognized as a reduction to our earnings in 2008, for which we did not recognize similar charges in 2009 based on the change in accounting discussed above. These decreases are in addition to the noncontrolling interest partners share of increased losses of our consolidated real estate partnerships in 2009 as compared to 2008. Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership consist of common partnership units and preferred OP Units held by limited partners in the Aimco Operating Partnership other than Aimco. We allocate the Aimco Operating Partnerships income or loss to the holders of common partnership units based on the weighted average number of common partnership units (including those held by Aimco) outstanding during the period. Holders of the preferred OP Units participate in the Aimco Operating Partnerships income or loss only to the extent of their preferred distributions. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed by $1.5 million. This change is primarily attributable to the $1.8 million excess of the carrying amount over the consideration paid in our repurchase of certain preferred OP Units during 2010, which is reflected as a reduction of income allocated to preferred noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed by $62.3 million. This change is attributable to a decrease of $50.8 million related to the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnerships share of income from discontinued operations (net of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships), due primarily to larger gains on sales in 2008 relative to 2009 and $11.5 million in deficit distribution charges recognized during 2008 due to distributions in excess of the positive balance in noncontrolling interest. These changes were also affected by a decrease in the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnerships effective ownership interest from 2008 to 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. From time to time, we have non revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon 33 Table of Contents completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. As discussed in Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, during 2008 we recognized impairment losses on our Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas properties of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax) and $5.7 million, respectively. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; and changes in interest rates and the availability of financing. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment of our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. During 2011, we expect to market for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy. For any properties that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during 2011, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these assets may result in additional impairment losses. In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas discussed above, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairment losses of $0.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use, and during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded no additional impairments related to properties held for use. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $12.7 million, $54.5 million and $27.4 million, respectively, for properties included in discontinued operations, primarily due to reductions in the estimated holding periods for assets sold during these periods. Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and from non affiliates represent our two portfolio segments, as defined in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010 20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses, that we use to evaluate for potential loan loss. Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner but do not consolidate the partnership. These loans are typically due on demand, have no stated maturity date and may not require current payments of principal or interest. Notes receivable from non affiliates have stated maturity dates and may require current payments of principal and interest. Repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate properties and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders, which are generally senior to our claims. Our notes receivable consist of two classes: loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as par value notes; and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as discounted notes. We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual 34 Table of Contents loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income. We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed or entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We update our cash flow projections of the borrowers annually, and more frequently for certain loans depending on facts and circumstances. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Factors that affect this assessment include the fair value of the partnerships real estate, pending transactions to refinance the partnerships senior obligations or sell the partnerships real estate, and market conditions (current and forecasted) related to a particular asset. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recorded net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $0.9 million, $21.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively. As discussed in Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, provisions for losses on notes receivable in 2009 and 2008 include impairment losses of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) and $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax), respectively, on our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which we account for as a note receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. We characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital additions activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see Capital Additions and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $11.6 million, $9.8 million and $25.7 million of interest costs, respectively, and $25.3 million, $40.0 million and $78.1 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. The reductions from 2008 to 2010 are primarily due to a reduced level of redevelopment activities. Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance 35 Table of Contents because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREITs April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and premiums or discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other REITs. In addition to FFO, we compute an alternate measure of FFO, which we refer to as Pro forma FFO and which is FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding operating real estate impairments and preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Both operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts are items that periodically affect our operating results. We exclude operating real estate impairment losses, net of related income tax benefits and noncontrolling interests, from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because we believe the inclusion of such losses in FFO is inconsistent with the treatment of gains on the disposition of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. We exclude preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating results. Similar to FFO, we believe Pro forma FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Not all REITs present an alternate measure of FFO similar to our Pro forma FFO measure and there can be no assurance our basis for calculating Pro forma FFO is comparable to those of other REITs that do provide such a measure. 36 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our FFO and Pro forma FFO are calculated as follows (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Net (loss) income attributable to Aimco common stockholders(1) $ (125,318 ) $ (114,840 ) $ 351,314 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 426,060 427,666 376,473 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (14,552 ) (16,563 ) (17,267 ) Depreciation of rental property related to noncontrolling partners and unconsolidated entities(2) (46,318 ) (38,219 ) (25,616 ) Loss (gain) on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other, net of noncontrolling partners interests(2) 623 (12,845 ) (97,993 ) Income tax expense (benefit) arising from disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other 8 1,582 (433 ) Deficit distributions to noncontrolling partners(3) 38,124 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of noncontrolling partners interest(2) (74,169 ) (166,146 ) (618,108 ) Depreciation of rental property, net of noncontrolling partners interest(2) 7,973 59,845 121,208 Deficit distributions to noncontrolling partners, net(3) (30,798 ) Income tax expense arising from disposals 8,819 5,788 43,146 Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments(4) (21,521 ) (19,509 ) 21,667 Preferred stock dividends 52,079 52,215 55,190 Preferred stock redemption related amounts 1,511 (1,649 ) (1,482 ) Amounts allocable to participating securities(5) 6,985 FFO $ 215,195 $ 177,325 $ 222,410 Preferred stock dividends (52,079 ) (52,215 ) (55,190 ) Preferred stock redemption related amounts (1,511 ) 1,649 1,482 Amounts allocable to participating securities(5) (655 ) (773 ) (6,985 ) Dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities 4,292 FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted $ 160,950 $ 125,986 $ 166,009 Operating real estate impairment losses, net of noncontrolling partners interest and related income tax benefit(6) 17,325 59,250 26,905 Preferred equity redemption related amounts(7) (254 ) (1,649 ) (1,482 ) Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (1,191 ) (4,304 ) (2,474 ) Amounts allocable to participating securities(5) (82 ) (448 ) Pro forma FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted $ 176,748 $ 178,835 $ 188,958 FFO and Pro forma FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted(8) Weighted average common shares outstanding diluted (earnings per share) 116,369 114,301 88,690 Dilutive common share equivalents 324 1,262 1,137 Dilutive preferred securities 1,490 Total 116,693 115,563 91,317 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for calculating basic earnings per common share in accordance with GAAP (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). (2) Noncontrolling partners refers to noncontrolling partners in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (3) Prior to our adoption of the provisions of SFAS 160, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 810 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), we recognized deficit distributions to noncontrolling partners as charges in our statement of operations when cash was distributed to a noncontrolling partner in a consolidated partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partners noncontrolling interest balance. We recorded these charges for GAAP purposes even though there was no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to noncontrolling partners occurred when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeded its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate had appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to noncontrolling partners represented, in substance, either (a) our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the noncontrolling partner or (b) a payment related to the noncontrolling partners share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, we added back deficit distributions and subtracted related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to FFO. Subsequent to our adoption of 37 Table of Contents SFAS 160, effective January 1, 2009, we may reduce the balance of noncontrolling interests below zero in such situations and we are no longer required to recognize such charges in our statement of operations. (4) During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Aimco Operating Partnership had 6,037,616, 6,534,140 and 7,191,199 common OP Units outstanding and 2,340,029, 2,344,719 and 2,367,629 High Performance Units outstanding. (5) Amounts allocable to participating securities represent dividends declared and any amounts of undistributed earnings allocable to participating securities. See Note 2 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information regarding participating securities. (6) On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of FFO to include operating real estate impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimcos presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. (7) In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D 42, Aimco includes preferred stock redemption related amounts in FFO. As a result, FFO for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes redemption discounts, net of issuance costs, of $0.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which we exclude from our calculation of Pro forma FFO. (8) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus common share equivalents and preferred securities that are dilutive for FFO and Pro forma FFO. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales, proceeds from refinancings of existing property loans, borrowings under new property loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity demands. We may use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, primarily secured, the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels, many lenders have reentered the market, and the CMBS market is showing signs of recovery. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we mitigate this exposure through our continued focus on reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk, by refinancing such loans with long dated, fixed rate property loans. If property financing options become unavailable for our debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in certain capital spending or proceeds from asset dispositions. As further discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we are subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate liabilities and preferred stock. At December 31, 2010, we estimate that a 1.0% increase in 30 day LIBOR with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our net income (or increase our net loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders by approximately $3.9 million on an annual basis. The effect of an increase in 30 day LIBOR may be mitigated by the effect of our variable rate assets. 38 Table of Contents As further discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we use total rate of return swaps as a financing product to lower our cost of borrowing through conversion of fixed rate debt to variable rates. The cost of financing through these arrangements is generally lower than the fixed rate on the debt. As of December 31, 2010, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions with notional amounts totaling $277.3 million. Swaps with notional amounts of $248.1 million and $29.2 million had maturity dates in May 2012 and October 2012, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received net cash receipts of $20.9 million under the total return swaps, which positively affected our liquidity. To the extent interest rates increase above the fixed rates on the underlying borrowings, our obligations under the total return swaps will negatively affect our liquidity. During 2010, we refinanced certain of the underlying borrowings subject to total rate of return swaps with long dated, fixed rate property debt, and we expect to do the same with certain of the underlying borrowings in 2011. The average effective interest rate associated with our borrowings subject to the total rate of return swaps was 1.6% at December 31, 2010. To the extent we are successful in refinancing additional of the borrowings subject to the total rate of return swaps during 2011, we anticipate the interest cost associated with these borrowings will increase, which would negatively affect our liquidity. We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. In the event a counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely affect our liquidity. However, at the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure. The total rate of return swaps require specified loan to value ratios. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline or if we sell properties in the collateral pool with low loan to value ratios, certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have an obligation to pay down the debt or provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which may adversely affect our cash flows. The obligation to provide collateral is limited to these subsidiaries and is non recourse to us. At December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries were not required to provide cash collateral based on the loan to value ratios of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements. See Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding these arrangements, including the current swap maturity dates and disclosures regarding fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2010, we had the capacity to borrow $260.3 million pursuant to our $300.0 million revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit). At December 31, 2010, we had $111.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $30.1 million from December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we had $201.4 million of restricted cash, a decrease of $17.3 million from December 31, 2009. Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital additions, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by operating activities of $257.5 million was primarily related to operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties, in excess of payments of operating accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including amounts related to our organizational restructuring. Cash provided by operating activities increased $23.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to decreases in interest paid and other working capital expenditures, including payments related to our restructuring accruals, in 2010 as compared to 2009, partially offset by a decrease in property net operating income, primarily due to property sales during 2009 and 2010. 39 Table of Contents Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by investing activities of $86.4 million consisted primarily of proceeds from disposition of real estate and partnership interests, partially offset by capital expenditures. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 51 consolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $402.5 million, generating proceeds totaling $387.9 million after the payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties. The $387.9 million is inclusive of debt assumed by buyers. Net cash proceeds from property sales were used primarily to repay or pay down property debt and for other corporate purposes. Capital expenditures totaled $178.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, and consisted primarily of Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements, and to a lesser extent included spending for redevelopment projects and casualties. In 2011, we expect to increase our redevelopment spending on conventional properties from approximately $30.0 million in 2010 to approximately $50.0 million to $75.0 million. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities, working capital and property sales. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in financing activities of $313.8 million was primarily attributed to debt principal payments, dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders, distributions to noncontrolling interests and our redemption and repurchase of preferred stock. Proceeds from property loans and our issuance of preferred stock partially offset the cash outflows. Property Debt At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, in consolidated property debt outstanding, which included $240.0 million at December 31, 2009, of property debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we refinanced or closed property loans on 23 properties generating $449.4 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.42%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $138.9 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance property debt primarily as a means of extending current and near term maturities and to finance certain capital projects. Credit Facility We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. During 2010, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the revolving commitments from $180.0 million to $300.0 million, extend the maturity from May 2012 to May 2014 (both inclusive of a one year extension option) and reduce the LIBOR floor on the facilitys base interest rate from 2.00% to 1.50%. During 2010, we also repaid in full the remaining $90.0 million term loan that was outstanding as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the Credit Agreement consisted of $300.0 million of revolving loan commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (either at LIBOR plus 4.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.50% or, at our option, a base rate equal to the prime rate plus a spread of 3.00%). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2013, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 35.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments. At December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010, was $260.3 million (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. 40 Table of Contents Our Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy covenant ratios of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service and earnings to fixed charges of 1.40:1 and 1.20:1, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as calculated based on the provisions in our Credit Agreement, we had a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service of 1.57:1 and a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of 1.33:1. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, the covenant ratios of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service and earnings to fixed charges required by our Credit Agreement will increase to 1.50:1 and 1.30:1, respectively. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid cash dividends or distributions totaling $53.4 million, $46.7 million and $10.1 million to preferred stockholders, common stockholders and noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 4,000,000 shares of our 7.75% Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $96.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction expenses of $3.3 million), and we sold 600,000 shares of our Common Stock pursuant to an At The Market, or ATM, offering program we initiated during 2010, generating $14.4 million of net proceeds. Aimco used the proceeds from the Common Stock issuance primarily to fund the acquisition of noncontrolling limited partnership interests for certain consolidated real estate partnerships. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 20 shares, or $10.0 million in liquidation preference, of CRA Preferred Stock for $7.0 million, and primarily using the proceeds from our issuance of preferred stock discussed above, we redeemed the 4,040,000 outstanding shares of our 9.375% Class G Cumulative Preferred Stock for $101.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends of $2.2 million. Pursuant to the ATM offering program discussed above, we may issue up to 6.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock. Additionally, we and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid cash distributions of $44.5 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, primarily related to property sales during 2010 and late 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling limited partnership interests in two consolidated partnerships, in which our affiliates serve as general partner, for total consideration of $19.9 million. This consideration consisted of $12.5 million in cash, $6.9 million in common OP Units and $0.5 million of other consideration. Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (amounts in thousands): Less than More than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt(1) $ 5,504,801 $ 288,990 $ 986,396 $ 941,339 $ 3,288,076 Interest related to long term debt(2) 2,223,580 308,220 550,958 447,195 917,207 Leases for space(3) 14,400 6,334 5,780 1,436 850 Other obligations(4) 3,750 3,750 Total $ 7,746,531 $ 607,294 $ 1,543,134 $ 1,389,970 $ 4,206,133 (1) Includes scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments related to our long term debt. (2) Includes interest related to both fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest related to variable rate debt is estimated based on the rate effective at December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a description of average interest rates associated with our debt. 41 Table of Contents (3) Inclusive of leased space that has been abandoned as part of our organizational restructuring in 2008. (4) Represents a commitment to fund $3.8 million in second mortgage loans on certain properties in West Harlem, New York City. In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, at December 31, 2010, we had $679.5 million (liquidation value) of perpetual preferred stock outstanding with annual dividend yields ranging from 1.5% (variable) to 8.0%, and $82.6 million (liquidation value) of redeemable preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 1.8% to 8.8%, or equal to the dividends paid on Common Stock based on the conversion terms. As further discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have a potential obligation to repurchase $20.0 million in liquidation preference our Series A Community Reinvestment Act Preferred Stock over the next two years for $14.0 million. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have notes receivable collateralized by second mortgages on certain properties in West Harlem in New York City. In certain circumstances, the obligor under these notes has the ability to put properties to us, which would result in a cash payment of approximately $30.6 million and the assumption of approximately $118.6 million in property debt. The obligors right to exercise the put is dependent upon the achievement of specified operating performance thresholds. Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment projects, Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests typically range from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances may exceed 50%. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes or accounts receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in base interest rates, credit risk spreads and availability of credit. We are not subject to any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse property debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We use total rate of return swaps to obtain the benefit of variable rates on certain of our fixed rate debt instruments. We make limited use of other derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. 42 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $470.3 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding and $57.0 million of variable rate preferred stock outstanding. Of the total debt subject to variable interest rates, floating rate tax exempt bond financing was approximately $374.4 million. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or SIFMA, rate, which since 1989 has averaged 75% of the 30 day LIBOR rate. If this historical relationship continues, we estimate that an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 100 basis points (75 basis points for tax exempt interest rates) with constant credit risk spreads would result in net income and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders being reduced (or the amounts of net loss and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders being increased) by $3.9 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $450.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and notes receivable, a portion of which bear interest at variable rates indexed to LIBOR based rates, and which may mitigate the effect of an increase in variable rates on our variable rate indebtedness and preferred stock discussed above. We estimate the fair value for our debt instruments using present value techniques that include income and market valuation approaches with market rates for debt with the same or similar terms. Present value calculations vary depending on the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In many cases, the fair value estimates may not be realizable in immediate settlement of the instruments. The estimated aggregate fair value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The combined carrying value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details on our consolidated debt. Refer to Derivative Financial Instruments in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding certain of our fixed rate debt that is subject to total rate of return swap instruments. If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our debt discussed above would have decreased from $5.6 billion to $5.3 billion. If market rates for our debt discussed above were lower by 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion.
