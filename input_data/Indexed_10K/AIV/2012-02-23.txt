Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our business activities are defined by a commitment to our core values of integrity, respect, collaboration, performance culture and a focus on our customers. These values and our corporate mission, to consistently provide quality apartment homes in a respectful environment delivered by a team of people who care, continually shape our culture. In all our dealings with residents, team members, business partners and stockholders, we aim to be the best owner and operator of apartment communities and an outstanding corporate citizen. Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our stockholders. Our business plan to achieve this objective is to: operate our nationwide portfolio of desirable apartment homes with valued amenities and extraordinary customer service in an efficient manner that realizes the benefits of our local management expertise; improve our diversified portfolio of apartments averaging B/B in quality with properties concentrated in the largest markets in the United States by selling properties with lower projected returns and reinvesting those proceeds through the purchase of other properties or additional investment in properties already in our portfolio, including increased ownership or redevelopment; and provide financial leverage primarily by the use of non recourse, long dated, fixed rate property debt and perpetual preferred equity, a combination which helps to limit our refunding and re pricing risk and provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates and inflation. Our owned real estate portfolio is comprised of two business components: conventional and affordable property operations, which also comprise our reportable segments. Our conventional property operations consist of market rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and included 198 properties with 62,834 units in which we held an average ownership of 93% as of December 31, 2011. Our affordable property operations consist of apartments with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency and consisted of 172 properties with 20,612 units in which we held an average ownership of 59% as of December 31, 2011. Affordable properties tend to have relatively more stable rents and higher occupancy due to government rent payments and thus are much less affected by market fluctuations. Our conventional and affordable properties generated 87% and 13%, respectively, of our proportionate property net operating income (defined in the Real Estate Operations discussion) during the year ended December 31, 2011. Our property operations currently are organized into two geographic areas, the West and East, each of which has a dedicated area operations leader and area financial officer to manage our nationwide portfolio more efficiently and to increase the benefits from our local management expertise. We seek to improve our oversight of property operations by: upgrading systems; standardizing business processes, operational measurements and internal reporting; and enhancing financial controls over field operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2011, our conventional portfolio monthly rents averaged $1,143 and provided 64% operating margins. These average rents increased about 9% from average rents of $1,049 for the three months ended December 31, 2010, approximately half of which resulted from rent growth and approximately half from the sale of properties with lower average rents. During the year ended December 31, 2011, on average, combined conventional new and renewal lease rates were 4.2% higher than expiring lease rates. Notwithstanding the economic challenges of the last several years, our diversified portfolio of conventional and affordable properties generated improved property operating results from 2008 to 2011. From 2008 to 2011, the net operating income of our same store properties and total real estate operations increased by 3.3% and 6.8%, respectively. We upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the sale of properties with lower projected returns, which are often in markets less desirable than our target markets, and reinvest these proceeds through the purchase of other properties or additional investment in properties already in our portfolio, including increased ownership or redevelopment. Increasing our ownership in properties in our portfolio is attractive as we already operate these properties and know them well, and these acquisitions are especially accretive where we can eliminate overhead costs, as further described below. A portion of the proceeds from 2011 property sales was used to fund $33.3 million of redevelopment spending on our conventional properties, the acquisition for $22.3 million of the noncontrolling interests in 12 partnerships that own 15 conventional properties and the acquisition for $63.9 million of interests in five conventional properties located in coastal California. 19 Table of Contents We continue to work toward simplifying our business, including winding down the portion of our business that generates transaction based activity fees. Revenues from transactional activities decreased from $68.2 million during 2008 to $9.2 million during 2011. Also as part of our effort to simplify our business, we are reducing the number of partnerships that own our conventional properties by acquiring the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships which allows us to reduce significant overhead and other costs associated with the separate accounting and reporting that is required for the partnerships, some of which are publicly registered. These and other simplification activities completed to date allowed us to reduce our offsite costs (including property management, investment management and general and administrative costs) from $191.3 million in 2008 to $101.7 million in 2011, with $14.1 million of this reduction achieved in 2011. Our leverage strategy seeks to balance increasing financial returns with the risks inherent with leverage. At December 31, 2011, approximately 86% of our leverage consisted of property level, non recourse, long dated, fixed rate, amortizing debt and 14% consisted of perpetual preferred equity, a combination which helps to limit our refunding and re pricing risk. At December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding corporate level debt. Our leverage strategy limits refunding risk on our property level debt. At December 31, 2011, the weighted average maturity of our property level debt was 8.0 years, with 3.7% of our unpaid principal balance maturing in 2012 (of which 32% has been rate locked and 40% has been extended by two years in connection with our refinancing activity), and on average 5.7% of our unpaid principal balance maturing per year from 2013 through 2016. Long duration, fixed rate liabilities provide a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates and inflation. Approximately 96% of our property level debt is fixed rate. We measure our leverage using, among other things, the ratios of EBITDA Coverage of Interest and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends. EBITDA is calculated by adding to our Pro forma FFO (defined below), our proportionate share of interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets, non cash stock based compensation, and dividends and distributions on our preferred equity instruments. Interest, as used in these ratios, represents our proportionate share of interest expense excluding debt prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs and reduced by interest income we receive on our investment in the subordinate tranches of a securitization that holds our property loans. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our EBITDA Coverage of Interest and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends ratios were 2.18:1 and 1.78:1, compared to ratios of 2.07:1 and 1.68:1, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. We also measure our leverage using the ratios of Debt to EBITDA and Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA. Debt, as used in these ratios, represents our proportionate share of debt, and Preferred Equity represents our preferred stock and the Preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2011, our ratios of Debt to EBITDA and Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA were 8.6:1 and 10.0:1. Although our primary sources of leverage are property level, non recourse, long dated, fixed rate, amortizing debt and perpetual preferred equity, we also have a revolving credit facility to meet our short term liquidity needs. During 2011, we expanded our revolving credit facility from $300.0 million to $500.0 million, providing additional liquidity for short term or unexpected cash requirements. As of December 31, 2011, we had the capacity to borrow $469.5 million pursuant to our revolving credit facility, net of $30.5 million for undrawn letters of credit backed by the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2014, and may be extended for two additional one year periods, subject to certain conditions. In connection with and as defined in our revolving credit facility, we have agreed to Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage covenants. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage ratios were 1.61:1 and 1:37.1, compared to covenants in place during the year of 1.40:1 and 1:20.1, respectively, and ratios of 1.57:1 and 1.33:1, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Key Financial Indicators The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Net Asset Value; Pro forma Funds From Operations; Adjusted Funds From Operations; property net operating income, which is rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes; proportionate property net operating income; same store property operating results; Free Cash Flow, which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; Free Cash Flow internal rate of return; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Pro forma Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations are defined and further described in the section captioned Funds From Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations, and proportionate property net operating income is defined and further described in the section captioned Real Estate Operations. The key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: household formations; rates of job growth; single family and multifamily housing starts; interest rates; and availability and cost of financing. 20 Table of Contents 2012 Goals During 2012, we intend to build upon our 2011 results. As our 2011 leasing activity earns in, it is expected to contribute 2.1% to 2012 revenue growth, a significant improvement over the 0.4% contribution from 2010 that earned into our 2011 results. We expect our average conventional rents to increase about 10% in 2012, with rent increases coming from both rent growth and the sale of properties with lower rents. We will also remain highly focused on cost control. We expect to continue to concentrate and upgrade our portfolio in our target markets through sales of properties outside these markets. We also expect to sell properties in our target markets that have lower projected returns. As part of this strategy, during 2012 we intend to sell more than 25 conventional properties with approximately 7,700 units (based on our average ownership) and more than 60 affordable properties with approximately 1,800 units (based on our average ownership). Proceeds from the sale of these properties will be partially used to increase our investment in our target markets by approximately $120.0 million through the redevelopment of Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), Lincoln Place and Madera Vista, three properties that are currently vacant, and we expect to invest between $5.0 million and $30.0 million in the redevelopment of five other properties. We also expect to use proceeds from property sales to invest $200.0 million in other property acquisitions, the majority of which will be our acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in 11 consolidated partnerships that own 19 conventional properties. Our acquisition of the noncontrolling interests discussed above will allow us to reduce overhead costs by eliminating the separate accounting, reporting and other costs associated with these partnerships. Additionally, we further intend to simplify our business during 2012 by selling NAPICO, a legacy asset management business, in a management led buyout. In February 2012, we entered into an agreement to transfer asset management of NAPICO, and to sell our interests in the portfolio to the new asset manager upon satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory approvals. We will provide a portion of the financing for the sale, which we expect to close later in 2012, at which time we will have liquidated all of our legacy asset management business. We expect these simplification efforts to result in further reductions in our offsite costs during 2012 and going forward. During 2012, we will continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet. We are in the process of refinancing all of our 2012 property debt maturities (32% of which is already rate locked and 40% of which has been extended by two years), and in 2012 we will continue to focus on refinancing our property debt maturing over the next several years to extend maturities and lock in current low interest rates. We expect a gradual reduction in leverage over time, as measured by improving coverage ratios, driven both by growth in net operating income and a reduction of property debt through scheduled amortization. Based on annualized projected fourth quarter 2012 EBITDA, we expect our EBITDA Coverage of Interest and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends ratios to be approximately 2.50:1 and 2.00:1, respectively, and we expect our 2012 year end Debt to EBITDA and Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA ratios to be approximately 7.5:1 and 9:1, respectively. We believe the 2012 Goals described above are achievable; however, actual results may differ materially from those described and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond our control. Results of Operations Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties affect our operating results. The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Overview 2011 highlights Highlights of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, are summarized below. Property operating information included in these highlights is based on proportionate property operating results, which is further described in the Real Estate Operations section. Conventional Same Store revenues and expenses for 2011 increased by 2.8% and decreased by 1.5%, respectively, resulting in a 5.3% increase in net operating income as compared to 2010. Total Same Store revenues and expenses for 2011 increased by 2.9% and decreased by 1.8%, respectively, resulting in a 5.9% increase in net operating income, as compared to 2010. Net operating income for our real estate portfolio (continuing operations) for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 4.9%, as compared to 2010. 21 Table of Contents As we continued the execution of our portfolio management strategy, we sold more properties during 2011 than in 2010, producing more proceeds available for accretive investments. As part of our effort to simplify our business, we negotiated the termination of the property and asset management contracts for approximately 100 properties with approximately 11,400 units. 2011 compared to 2010 We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $57.1 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to net loss attributable to Aimco of $71.7 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreases in losses of $14.6 million and $22.1 million, respectively. These decreases in net loss were principally due to an increase in net operating income of our properties included in continuing operations, reflecting improved operations, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, primarily due to prepayment penalties incurred in connection with a series of financing transactions completed in 2011 that extended maturities and reduced the effective interest rate on a number of non recourse property loans. 2010 compared to 2009 We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $71.7 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, increases in losses of $7.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively. These increases in net loss were principally due to a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily related to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate due to fewer property sales in 2010 as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in net operating income of our properties included in continuing operations, reflecting improved operations. The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail. Real Estate Operations Our real estate portfolio is comprised of two business components: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations, which also represent our two reportable segments. Our conventional real estate portfolio consists of market rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and includes 198 properties with 62,834 units. Our affordable real estate portfolio consists of 172 properties with 20,612 units, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Our conventional and affordable properties contributed 87% and 13%, respectively, of proportionate property net operating income amounts during the year ended December 31, 2011. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we consolidate certain properties in which we hold an insignificant economic interest and in some cases we do not consolidate other properties in which we have a significant economic interest. Due to the diversity of our economic ownership interests in our properties, our chief operating decision maker emphasizes as a key measurement of segment profit or loss proportionate property net operating income, which represents our share of the property net operating income of our consolidated and unconsolidated properties. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis. We do not include property management revenues, offsite costs associated with property management, or casualty related amounts in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. The tables and discussions below reflect the proportionate results of our conventional and affordable segments and the consolidated results related to our real estate operations not allocated to segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands). The tables and discussions below exclude the results of operations for properties included in discontinued operations as of December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reporting segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses. 22 Table of Contents Conventional Real Estate Operations Our conventional segment consists of conventional properties we classify as same store, redevelopment and other conventional properties. Same store properties are properties we own and manage that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy (greater than 90%) during the current and prior year comparable period. Redevelopment properties are those in which a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or for which other significant non unit renovations are underway or have been complete for less than one year. Other conventional properties may include conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, acquisition properties and properties that are not multifamily, such as commercial properties or fitness centers. Consistent application of our definitions of same store and redevelopment properties resulted in these populations differing for the purpose of comparing 2011 to 2010 results and 2010 to 2009 results. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as presented below, our conventional same store portfolio and our other conventional portfolio consisted of 157 and 41 properties with 55,196 and 7,638 units, respectively. From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, our conventional same store portfolio decreased on a net basis by one property and increased by 660 units. These changes consisted of: the removal of 23 properties, with 6,142 units that were sold or classified as held for sale through December 31, 2011, and for which the results have been reclassified into discontinued operations; the inclusion of 25 properties with 8,071 units for which redevelopment projects were completed primarily during 2009 but that did not meet the criteria to be classified as same store for comparative annual periods until 2011; and the removal of four properties with 1,595 units that experienced significant casualty losses and were moved from the same store classification into the other conventional classification, partially offset by the reintroduction of one property with 326 units into the same store classification.

Conventional same store proportionate property net operating income increased by $23.6 million, or 5.3%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $19.7 million, or 2.8%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average rent (approximately $27 per unit) and increases in miscellaneous income and utilities reimbursements, partially offset by a 42 basis point decrease in average daily occupancy. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2011, were 3.8% higher than expiring lease rates and renewal rates were 4.6% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in conventional same store property net operating income was also attributable to a $3.9 million, or 1.5%, decrease in property operating expense, primarily due to reductions in contract services, marketing, insurance and personnel and related costs. Our other conventional proportionate property net operating income decreased by $3.1 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to a 3.3% decrease in revenue from a larger number of vacant units resulting from the timing of casualties at certain of our properties in 2011 as compared to 2010. 23 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Conventional same store $ 602,960 $ 603,947 $ (987 ) (0.2 %) Conventional redevelopment 116,588 110,586 6,002 5.4 % Other Conventional 69,662 68,697 965 1.4 % Total 789,210 783,230 5,980 0.8 % Property operating expenses: Conventional same store 227,621 230,430 (2,809 ) (1.2 %) Conventional redevelopment 42,177 43,523 (1,346 ) (3.1 %) Other Conventional 33,774 33,089 685 2.1 % Total 303,572 307,042 (3,470 ) (1.1 %) Property net operating income: Conventional same store 375,339 373,517 1,822 0.5 % Conventional redevelopment 74,411 67,063 7,348 11.0 % Other Conventional 35,888 35,608 280 0.8 % Total $ 485,638 $ 476,188 $ 9,450 2.0 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, our conventional segments proportionate property net operating income increased $9.5 million, or 2.0%. Conventional same store property net operating income increased by $1.8 million, or 0.5%. This increase was attributable to a $2.8 million, or 1.2%, decrease in expense primarily due to a reduction during 2010 of previously estimated real estate tax obligations resulting from successful appeals settled during the period and lower marketing expense, partially offset by an increase in insurance costs. This decrease in expense was partially offset by a $1.0 million, or 0.2%, decrease in revenue, primarily due to lower average rent (approximately $32 per unit). The decrease in average rent was partially offset by a 185 basis point increase in average daily occupancy and higher utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income and a decrease in bad debt expense. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2010, were 2.3% lower than expiring lease rates and renewal rates were 1.5% higher than expiring lease rates. The net operating income of our conventional redevelopment properties increased by $7.3 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a $6.0 million, or 5.4%, increase in revenue resulting from higher average daily occupancy and an increase in utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income, and a $1.3 million, or 3.1%, reduction in expense primarily related to marketing expenses, partially offset by higher insurance. Our other conventional net operating income increased by $0.3 million, or 0.8%, due to an increase in revenue of $1.0 million, or 1.4%, offset by an increase in expense of $0.7 million, or 2.1%. Affordable Real Estate Operations Our affordable segment consists of properties we classify as same store or other (primarily redevelopment properties). Our criteria for classifying affordable properties as same store or other are consistent with those for our conventional properties described above. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our affordable same store portfolio and other affordable portfolio consisted of 115 and 57 properties with 14,244 and 6,368 units, respectively. From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, our affordable same store portfolio decreased due to the removal of 38 properties with 4,114 units that were sold or classified as held for sale through December 31, 2011, and for which the results have been reclassified into discontinued operations. 24 Table of Contents September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Affordable same store $ 108,387 $ 104,222 $ 4,165 4.0 % Other Affordable 14,511 13,710 801 5.8 % Total 122,898 117,932 4,966 4.2 % Property operating expenses: Affordable same store 45,300 47,102 (1,802 ) (3.8 %) Other Affordable 5,725 5,510 215 3.9 % Total 51,025 52,612 (1,587 ) (3.0 %) Property net operating income: Affordable same store 63,087 57,120 5,967 10.4 % Other Affordable 8,786 8,200 586 7.1 % Total $ 71,873 $ 65,320 $ 6,553 10.0 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010, the proportionate property net operating income of our affordable segment increased $6.6 million, or 10.0%. Affordable same store property net operating income increased by $6.0 million, or 10.4%, consisting of a $4.2 million, or 4.0%, increase in revenue and a $1.8 million, or 3.8%, decrease in expense. Affordable same store revenue increased primarily due to higher average rent ($32 per unit) and higher average daily occupancy (26 basis points) at our affordable same store properties. The increase in average rent was partially due to retroactive rent increases awarded in 2011 under government subsidy programs at certain of our affordable properties, $0.2 million of which relates to previous years. Affordable same store expenses decreased primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs, insurance and real estate tax expenses, the majority of which relates to successful recoveries associated with appeals for 2010 and prior years. The increase in our affordable segments proportionate property net operating income was also due to higher net operating income of our other affordable properties of $0.6 million, or 7.1%. 0000000000 0000000000 0000000000 0000000000 Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Rental and other property revenues: Affordable same store $ 104,222 $ 101,827 $ 2,395 2.4 % Other Affordable 13,710 12,695 1,015 8.0 % Total 117,932 114,522 3,410 3.0 % Property operating expenses: Affordable same store 47,102 46,349 753 1.6 % Other Affordable 5,510 5,989 (479 ) (8.0 %) Total 52,612 52,338 274 0.5 % Property net operating income: Affordable same store 57,120 55,478 1,642 3.0 % Other Affordable 8,200 6,706 1,494 22.3 % Total $ 65,320 $ 62,184 $ 3,136 5.0 % The proportionate property net operating income of our affordable segment increased $3.1 million, or 5.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009. Affordable same store net operating income increased by $1.6 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to a $2.4 million, or 2.4%, increase in revenue due to higher average rent ($22 per unit) and higher average daily occupancy (14 basis points). The net operating income of our other affordable properties increased by $1.5 million, or 22.3%, primarily due to an 8.0% increase in revenue driven by higher average rent ($23 per unit) and higher average occupancy. Non Segment Real Estate Operations Real estate operations net operating income amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include property management revenues, offsite costs associated with property management, and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). 25 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, property management expenses, which includes offsite costs associated with managing properties we own (both our share and the share of such cost that we allocate to the limited partners in our consolidated partnerships) and offsite costs associated with properties we manage for third parties, totaled $41.4 million, $48.2 million and $51.2 million, respectively. The decrease in property management expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the termination in early 2011 of our role as asset manager and property manager for approximately 100 properties with approximately 11,400 units. The decrease in property management expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, casualty losses increased by $3.9 million, from $7.7 million to $11.6 million, primarily due to $5.2 million of losses in 2011 from severe snow storms in the Northeast that damaged several properties along with a $1.6 million loss resulting from a severe wind storm in California during 2011 that damaged a property. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, casualty losses decreased by $3.9 million, from $11.6 million to $7.7 million, primarily due to losses incurred during 2009 resulting from properties damaged by Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Ike and other less severe storms and casualty events. Asset Management and Tax Credit Revenues We perform activities and services for consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes. In recent years, in an effort to simplify our business, we have reduced our role in transactional activities and accordingly the amount of earnings we generate from transactional activities has decreased. As we continue to work toward our simplification strategy, we expect the amounts of transactional fees to continue to diminish. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, asset management and tax credit revenues increased $3.0 million. This increase is primarily attributable to a $2.1 million increase in general partner transactional fees, a $2.0 million increase in income related to the syndication of low income housing tax credit partnerships, and a $1.3 million increase in asset management fees. The increase in asset management fees primarily related to the termination in early 2011 of our role as asset manager for approximately 100 properties, pursuant to which we agreed to receive a reduced payment on asset management and other fees owed to us, a portion of which was not previously recognized based on concerns regarding collectability. These increases in asset management and tax credit revenues during 2011 were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $14.2 million. This decrease is attributable to an $8.7 million decrease in income related to our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, $3.8 million of which relates to the delivery in 2009 of historic property rehabilitation tax credits with no comparable activity in 2010, and the remainder of which is primarily due to a reduction in amortization of deferred tax credit income. Asset management and tax credit revenues also decreased by $1.9 million due to the elimination of asset management fees related to properties we consolidated at the beginning of 2010, for which the benefit of these fees is now included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, a $1.9 million decrease in disposition and other fees we earn in connection with transactional activities, and a $1.7 million decrease in promote income. Investment Management Expenses Investment management expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel that perform asset management and tax credit activities. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, investment management expenses decreased $4.1 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $1.7 million reduction in personnel and related costs and a $2.4 million decrease in expenses, primarily related to our write off during 2010 of previously deferred costs related to tax credit projects we abandoned. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, investment management expenses decreased $1.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $4.3 million reduction in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings, partially offset by a $3.0 million net increase in expenses, primarily related to our write off during 2010 of previously deferred costs related to tax credit projects we abandoned. 26 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, depreciation and amortization decreased $19.7 million, or 5.0%, primarily due to properties that became fully depreciated in 2010 and adjustments of depreciation recognized during 2011 related to revisions of the estimated useful lives of certain real estate properties. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization decreased $4.3 million, or 1.1%. This decrease was primarily due to depreciation adjustments recognized in 2009 to reduce the carrying amount of certain properties. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation primarily related to properties we consolidated during 2010 based on our adoption of revised accounting guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. Provision for Operating Real Estate Impairment Losses During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized impairment losses totaling $4.3 million, $0.1 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use. These impairments losses were recognized primarily due to reductions in the estimated period over which we expect to hold the properties, coupled with reductions in the estimated fair values of the assets as compared with their carrying amounts. General and Administrative Expenses In recent years, we have worked toward simplifying our business, including winding down the portion of our business that generates transaction based activity fees and reducing the number of partnerships that own our conventional properties by acquiring the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships, which allows us to reduce significant overhead and other costs associated with these activities. These and other simplification activities, along with our scale reductions completed to date have allowed us to reduce our offsite costs, a portion of which is included in general and administrative expenses, by $14.1 million, or 12.2%, in 2011, and by $89.6 million or 46.8% since 2008. Our general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 5.4% in 2009, to 5.1% in 2010 and 4.7% in 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to net reductions in personnel and related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 5.8%, primarily attributable to net reductions in personnel and related expenses, partially offset by an increase in information technology outsourcing costs. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, other expenses, net increased by $9.9 million. The net increase in other expense during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to the settlement of various litigation matters during 2010, which resulted in a net gain in our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, other expenses, net decreased by $4.5 million. During 2009, we settled certain litigation matters resulting in a net expense in our operations, and in 2010 we settled certain litigation matters that resulted in a net gain in our operations. The effect of the expense in 2009 and gain in 2010 resulted in a $14.8 million decrease in other expenses, net from 2009 to 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of our insurance (net of a reduction in the number of properties insured from 2009 to 2010). Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable (including those from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which are classified within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets), accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts and interest on investments in debt securities in a securitization of certain of our property loans. 27 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income decreased $0.3 million, or 2.6%. This decrease in interest income was primarily due to our recognition of accretion income during 2010 on discounted notes that were repaid in advance of their maturity dates. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income increased $1.9 million, or 22.4%. Interest income increased during 2010 primarily due to an increase of accretion income related to a change in timing and amount of collection for certain of our discounted notes, including several notes that were repaid in advance of their maturity dates. Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $0.5 million of net recoveries of previously recognized losses on notes receivable, primarily related to property sales during 2011 for which the net proceeds available for repayment of partnership loans exceeded the amounts previously anticipated. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a net provision for losses on notes receivable of $0.9 million, primarily due to concerns regarding the collectability of the corresponding notes receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a net provision for losses on notes receivable of $21.5 million, which consisted primarily of an impairment related to our interest in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re entitle and develop land parcels in southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we accounted for our investment as a note receivable. In connection with the preparation of our 2009 annual financial statements and as a result of declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our then recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax). Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties, increased by $13.8 million. Property related interest expense increased by $15.5 million, primarily due to our recognition during 2011 of $20.7 million of prepayment penalties and the write off of $2.3 million of deferred loan costs in connection with the completion of a series of financing transactions in which we reduced the weighted average interest rate and extended to ten years the maturity on over $600.0 million of property loans, partially offset by a decrease in interest on our property debt primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities. The series of financing transactions is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Corporate level interest expense decreased by $1.7 million primarily due to the repayment of our term loan during 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased by $0.4 million. Corporate interest expense decreased $7.6 million, primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance on our term loan, which we repaid during July 2010. This decrease in corporate interest expense was partially offset by a $7.2 million increase in property related interest expense, due to a $2.8 million net increase related to properties newly consolidated and deconsolidated in 2010 (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our adoption of ASU 2009 17) and an increase related to properties refinanced with higher average outstanding balances, partially offset by lower average rates. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships Equity in earnings or losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships includes our share of the net earnings or losses of our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which may include impairment losses, gains or losses on the disposition of real estate properties or depreciation expense, which generally exceeds the net operating income recognized by such unconsolidated partnerships. During the periods presented, the majority of the investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships included in our consolidated balance sheets were entities that we consolidated in our financial statements even though we held a nominal economic interest in these entities. Accordingly, the equity in earnings and losses recognized by these entities were allocated to noncontrolling interests and had no significant effect on the amounts of net loss attributable to Aimco. 28 Table of Contents Gain on Dispositions of Interests in Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other Gain on dispositions of interests in unconsolidated real estate and other includes gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and certain costs related to asset disposal activities, which vary from period to period. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $2.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively, in net gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate and other. These gains were primarily related to sales of investments held by consolidated partnerships in which we generally hold a nominal general partner interest. Based on our nominal economic interest in the consolidated partnerships that sold these investments, substantially all of these gains were allocated to the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships and had no significant effect on the amounts of net loss attributable to Aimco during the periods. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, gain on dispositions of interests in unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $10.9 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to $8.6 million of additional proceeds received in 2009 related to our disposition during 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership and a $4.0 million gain from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization during 2009. Income Tax Benefit Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk management are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, income tax benefit decreased by $9.9 million, from $17.1 million to $7.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in the losses of our TRS entities. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax benefit decreased by $3.4 million, from $20.5 million to $17.1 million. This decrease in income tax benefit was primarily due to the tax benefit we recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties, LLC, for which no similar benefit was recognized in 2010, and was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits related to increased losses of our TRS entities. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property specific interest expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, income from discontinued operations totaled $83.9 million and $73.9 million, respectively. The $10.0 million increase in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $15.1 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to more properties sold in 2011 as compared to 2010, with the balance of the change resulting from decreases in operating income, net of interest expense, due to the timing of sales. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, income from discontinued operations totaled $73.9 million and $152.7 million, respectively. The $78.8 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $128.2 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2010 as compared to 2009, with the balance of the change resulting from decreases in operating income, net of interest expense, due to the timing of sales. 29 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 67 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $473.5 million and net proceeds of $185.6 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $101.2 million (which is net of $7.0 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 51 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $401.4 million and net proceeds of $118.4 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $86.1 million (which is net of $8.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 89 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $1.3 billion and net proceeds of $432.7 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $216.2 million (which is net of $5.8 million of related income taxes). The weighted average net operating income capitalization rates for our conventional and affordable property sales, which are calculated using our proportionate share of the trailing twelve month net operating income prior to sale, less a 3.5% management fee, divided by our proportionate share of gross proceeds, were 7.1% and 8.9%, respectively, for sales during the year ended December 31, 2011, 8.9% and 9.6%, respectively, for sales during the year ended December 31, 2010, and 8.7% and 7.9%, respectively, for sales during the year ended December 31, 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of discontinued operations. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the results of our consolidated real estate partnerships allocated to the non Aimco owners in these partnerships. We adjust our total consolidated operating results in our consolidated financial statements to determine the portion of our consolidated operating results that corresponds to our ownership interest in all of our consolidated entities. The amounts of income or loss of our consolidated real estate partnerships that we allocate to the non Aimco owners includes their share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts that we charge to these partnerships. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the non Aimco owners share of our operating results were losses of $0.3 million and $13.3 million, a $13.0 million decrease in their share of net losses year over year. This decrease was primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in their share of income from discontinued operations, which is primarily due to an increase in gains on the disposition of real estate from 2010 to 2011, and a $4.4 million decrease in their share of loss from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the non Aimco owners share of our operating results was a loss of $13.3 million, as compared to net income of $22.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a variance of $35.8 million. This change was substantially attributed to a decrease in their share of income from discontinued operations, which decreased primarily due to a reduction in gains on the dispositions of real estate from 2009 to 2010. Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership reflects the results of the Aimco Operating Partnership that are allocated to the non Aimco owners of OP Units. We allocate the Aimco Operating Partnerships income or loss to the holders of common OP Units and equivalents based on the weighted average number of these units (including those held by Aimco) outstanding during the period. The amount of the Aimco Operating Partnerships income allocated to holders of the preferred OP Units is equal to the amount of distributions they receive. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the non Aimco owners share of the Aimco Operating Partnerships operating results represented losses of $0.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, a decrease in their share of losses of $3.8 million. The common noncontrolling interests share of our consolidated net losses decreased by $2.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in our losses from continuing operations from 2010 to 2011. This was partially offset by an increase in the preferred noncontrolling interests share of our earnings, which was primarily due to the effect on income attributed to preferred noncontrolling interests resulting from the repurchase of preferred OP Units in 2010 discussed below. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, the non Aimco owners share of the Aimco Operating Partnerships operating results represented losses of $4.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, an increase in their share of losses of $1.5 million. This change is primarily attributable to the $1.8 million excess of the carrying amount over the consideration paid in our repurchase of certain preferred OP Units during 2010, which is reflected as a reduction of income allocated to preferred noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership. 30 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. If an impairment loss is not required to be recorded, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. From time to time, we have non revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include: the general economic climate; competition from other apartment communities and other housing options; local conditions, such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates; changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; and changes in interest rates and the availability of financing. Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment of our long lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. As we execute our portfolio strategy over the next two years, we intend to sell more than 100 properties that do not align with our long term investment strategy, including more than 85 properties targeted for sale during 2012. While there is no assurance that we will meet this disposition target, the size of our portfolio is likely to change as we continue to execute our portfolio management strategy. For any properties that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during 2012, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these properties may result in additional impairment losses. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairment losses of $4.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized impairment losses of $15.9 million, $13.0 million and $56.1 million, respectively, for properties included in discontinued operations, primarily due to reductions in the estimated holding periods for properties sold during these periods. Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable We assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of the projected cash flow of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We update our projections of the cash flow of such borrowers annually, and more frequently for certain loans depending on facts and circumstances. We recognize provisions for losses on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Factors that affect this assessment include the fair value of the partnerships real estate, pending transactions to refinance the partnerships senior obligations 31 Table of Contents or sell the partnerships real estate, and market conditions (current and forecasted) related to a particular asset. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the provision is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loans original effective interest rate. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a net recovery of previously recognized provisions for losses on notes receivable of $0.5 million, as compared to $0.9 million and $21.5 million net provisions for losses on notes receivable during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As discussed in Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, provisions for losses on notes receivable in 2009 includes an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) on our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which we account for as a note receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectability of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors. Capitalized Costs We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. Indirect costs are allocations of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital additions activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see Capital Additions and Related Depreciation in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $14.0 million, $11.6 million and $9.8 million of interest costs, respectively, and $25.7 million, $25.3 million and $40.0 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. The reductions in capitalized payroll and indirect costs from 2009 to 2010 are primarily due to a reduced level of redevelopment activities. Funds From Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis to determine FFO. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting, if dilutive, redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and premiums or discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases. In addition to FFO, we compute Pro forma FFO and Adjusted FFO, or AFFO, which are also non GAAP financial measures we believe are helpful to investors in understanding our performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect our operating results and we exclude these items from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests). FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance or as measures of liquidity. These non GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although we use these non GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our performance against other REITs, not all REITs compute these same non GAAP measures and computation of AFFO is subject to definitions of capital spending, which are subjective. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs. 32 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are calculated as follows (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Net (loss) income attributable to Aimco common stockholders (1) $ (103,161 ) $ (125,318 ) $ (114,840 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 378,043 397,740 402,035 Depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets (12,942 ) (14,380 ) (16,400 ) Depreciation of rental property related to noncontrolling partners and unconsolidated entities (2) (29,638 ) (39,155 ) (34,001 ) (Gain) loss on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other, net of noncontrolling partners interests (2) (2,158 ) 647 (13,300 ) Operating real estate impairment losses, net of noncontrolling partners interest 3,868 65 443 Impairment losses related to unconsolidated real estate partnerships, net 4,042 203 Discontinued operations: Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of noncontrolling partners interest (2) (67,723 ) (68,545 ) (157,799 ) Operating real estate impairment losses, net of noncontrolling partners interest and related income tax benefit (2) 12,360 11,851 54,540 Depreciation of rental property, net of noncontrolling partners interest (2) 13,557 28,959 81,096 Income tax expense arising from disposals and impairments, net 6,990 8,385 3,745 Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of above adjustments (3) (20,868 ) (22,731 ) (23,937 ) Amounts allocable to participating securities (4) (556 ) (738 ) (1,234 ) FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted $ 181,814 $ 176,983 $ 180,348 Preferred equity redemption related amounts (5) (3,904 ) (254 ) (1,649 ) Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnerships share of preferred redemption amounts (3) 266 18 123 Amounts allocable to participating securities (4) 16 1 13 Pro forma FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted $ 178,192 $ 176,748 $ 178,835 Capital Replacements, net of common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership and participating securities (3,4) (73,802 ) (60,181 ) (64,454 ) AFFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders diluted $ 104,390 $ 116,567 $ 114,381 Weighed average common shares outstanding diluted (earnings per share) 119,312 116,369 114,301 Dilutive common share equivalents 314 324 1,262 Weighed average common shares outstanding diluted (FFO)(6) 119,626 116,693 115,563 Notes: (1) Represents the numerator for calculating basic earnings per common share in accordance with GAAP (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). (2) Noncontrolling partners refers to noncontrolling partners in our consolidated real estate partnerships. (3) During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Aimco Operating Partnership had outstanding 8,368,855, 8,377,645 and 8,878,859 common OP Units and equivalents that were owned by limited partners other than Aimco. (4) Amounts allocable to participating securities represent dividends declared and any amounts of undistributed earnings allocable to participating securities. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information regarding participating securities. (5) In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D 42, Aimco includes preferred stock redemption related amounts in FFO. As a result, FFO for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes redemption discounts, net of issuance costs, of $3.9 million, $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which we exclude from our calculation of Pro forma FFO. (6) Represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales, proceeds from refinancings of existing property loans, borrowings under new property loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity needs, we have additional means, such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short term liquidity needs. We may use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long term borrowings, primarily secured, the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations. The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we have mitigated much of this exposure through our reduction in short and intermediate term maturity risk through refinancing such loans with long dated, fixed rate property loans. However, if property financing options become unavailable for our further debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in certain capital spending or proceeds from asset dispositions. As further discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we are subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate liabilities and preferred stock. At December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 1.0 % increase in 30 day LIBOR with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our net income (or increase our net loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders by approximately $1.9 million on an annual basis. The effect of an increase in 30 day LIBOR may be mitigated by its effect in increasing income earned on our variable rate assets. We use total rate of return swaps as a financing product to lower our cost of borrowing through conversion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The cost of financing through these arrangements is generally lower than the fixed rate on the debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had total rate of return swap positions with one financial institution with notional amounts totaling $75.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received net cash receipts of $10.2 million under the total return swaps, which positively affected our liquidity. During 2011, we reduced significantly the amount of debt subject to total rate of return swaps. Accordingly, we expect the amount of net cash we receive under total rate of return swap arrangements will decrease significantly from what we received during 2011. The total rate of return swaps require specified loan to value ratios which may require us to pay down the debt or provide additional collateral, which may adversely affect our cash flows. At December 31, 2011, we had provided $20.0 million of cash collateral pursuant to the swap agreements to satisfy the loan to value requirements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding these arrangements, including the maturity dates of the swaps. As of December 31, 2011, we had the capacity to borrow $469.5 million pursuant to our revolving credit facility, net of $30.5 million for undrawn letters of credit backed by the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2011, we had $91.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $20.3 million from December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had $186.7 million of restricted cash, a decrease of $12.5 million from December 31, 2010. Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital additions, property taxes and insurance, and escrows related to tenant security deposits. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. 34 Table of Contents Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash provided by operating activities of $258.8 million was primarily related to operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties, and interest related to our non recourse property debt. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $1.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to changes in working capital from 2010 to 2011, partially attributable to our reductions in offsite costs, substantially offset by the prepayment penalties incurred during 2011 in connection with a series of property financing transactions. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash provided by investing activities of $40.5 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the disposition of real estate and the release of capital improvement escrows, partially offset by capital expenditures, purchases of real estate and the purchase of investments in debt securities. Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold or disposed of 67 consolidated properties for an aggregate sales price of $473.5 million, generating proceeds totaling $185.6 million after the amount of property debt repaid upon the sale or assumed by the buyers, and after the payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties. Net cash proceeds from property sales were used primarily to fund redevelopment spending on our conventional properties and property investments, including investments in other properties and acquisitions of the noncontrolling interests in certain of our consolidated properties. Capital expenditures totaled $200.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, and consisted primarily of Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements, and to a lesser extent spending for redevelopment projects and casualties. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities, working capital and property sales. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in financing activities of $319.6 million was primarily attributed to debt principal payments, dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders, distributions to noncontrolling interests and our redemption and repurchase of preferred stock. Proceeds from property loans and our issuance of preferred and common stock partially offset the cash outflows. Property Debt At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, in consolidated property debt outstanding, which included $13.0 million and $276.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of property debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we refinanced or closed property loans on 44 properties generating $966.1 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80% inclusive of the financing transactions discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $48.2 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance property debt primarily as a means of extending current and near term maturities and to finance certain capital projects. Revolving Credit Facility We have a Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. During 2011, we entered into the Credit Agreement to replace our prior revolving credit facility and, among other things, increase the revolving commitments from $300.0 million to $500.0 million, extend the maturity from May 2013 (exclusive of a one year extension option) to December 2014 (exclusive of two one year extension options), reduce by 1.50% the initial spread we pay over both LIBOR and prime rates, and eliminate the 1.50% LIBOR floor on the facilitys base interest rate that existed in the prior facility. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (initially either at LIBOR plus 2.75% or, at our option, a base rate as defined in the Credit Agreement). The revolving credit facility matures December 2014, and may be extended for two additional one year periods, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 25.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments. 35 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and we had the capacity to borrow $469.5 million, net of $30.5 million for undrawn letters of credit backed by the revolving credit facility. The proceeds of revolving loans are generally used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. Our Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy, among other customary financial covenants, ratios of EBITDA to debt service and EBITDA to fixed charges of 1.40:1 and 1.20:1, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as calculated based on the provisions in our Credit Agreement, we had a ratio of EBITDA to debt service of 1.61:1 and a ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges of 1.37:1. In the first quarter of 2012, the covenant ratios of EBITDA to debt service and EBITDA to fixed charges required by our Credit Agreement will increase to 1.50:1 and 1.30:1, respectively. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during 2012. Equity Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid cash dividends or distributions totaling $49.8 million, $57.6 million and $11.9 million to preferred stockholders, common stockholders and noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid cash distributions of $46.5 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, primarily related to property sales during 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we issued approximately 869,200 shares of 7.00% Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in an underwritten public offering and subsequent offerings through an at the market, or ATM, offering program, for net proceeds per share of $23.00 (reflecting an average price to the public of $24.25 per share, less underwriting discounts, commissions and transaction costs of approximately $1.25 per share). The offerings generated net proceeds of $20.0 million. Also during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily using the proceeds from our Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock issuances, we redeemed 862,500 shares (25% of the amount outstanding) of our Class V Cumulative Preferred Stock. This redemption was for cash at a price equal to $25.00 per share, or $21.6 million in aggregate, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends of approximately $0.2 million. We intend to accumulate the proceeds from further ATM issuances of our Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock and use them for further redemptions of outstanding preferred securities with higher required dividend rates. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold 2.9 million shares of Common Stock under our common stock ATM offering program, generating $73.6 million of gross proceeds, or $71.9 million, respectively, net of commissions. We used the net proceeds primarily to fund the investments discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to ATM offering programs active at December 31, 2011, we have the capacity to issue up to 3.5 million and 3.9 million additional shares of our Common Stock and Class Z Preferred Stock, respectively. Additionally, we and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired noncontrolling limited partnership interests in 12 consolidated real estate partnerships that own 15 properties and in which our affiliates serve as general partner, for a total cost of $22.3 million, and we redeemed approximately 237,000 common OP Units for cash of $6.1 million. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (amounts in thousands): Total Less thanOne Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More thanFive Years Long term debt (1) $ 5,172,320 $ 267,278 $ 722,726 $ 857,969 $ 3,324,347 Interest related to long term debt (2) 2,001,137 276,569 501,793 428,273 794,502 Long term debt on assets held for sale (1) 13,012 255 573 2,671 9,513 Interest related to long term debt on assets held for sale (2) 1,940 157 331 278 1,174 Leases for space 11,848 5,248 3,953 2,002 645 Other obligations (3) 12,604 10,227 2,377 Total $ 7,212,861 $ 559,734 $ 1,231,753 $ 1,291,193 $ 4,130,181 (1) Includes scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments related to our long term debt. (2) Includes interest related to both fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest related to variable rate debt is estimated based on the rate effective at December 31, 2011. Refer to Note 7 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a description of average interest rates associated with our debt. (3) Includes a commitment to fund $3.0 million in second mortgage loans on certain properties in West Harlem, New York City, and approximately $9.6 million of obligations related to our redevelopment activities. In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, at December 31, 2011, we had $659.7 million (liquidation value) of perpetual preferred stock outstanding with annual dividend yields ranging from 1.6% (variable) to 8.0%, and $82.5 million (liquidation value) of redeemable preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 1.8% to 8.8%, or equal to the dividends paid on our Common Stock. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have notes receivable collateralized by second mortgages on certain properties in West Harlem in New York City. In certain circumstances, the obligor under these notes has the ability to put these properties to us, which would result in a cash payment by us of approximately $30.8 million and our assumption of approximately $118.4 million in property debt. The obligors right to exercise the put is dependent upon the achievement of specified operating performance thresholds. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, pursuant to financing arrangements on two of our conventional redevelopment properties, we are contractually obligated to complete the planned projects. The majority of the capital spending will be funded from construction financing that will be converted to permanent non recourse property loans upon completion of the projects. Based on the uncertainty regarding the timing and the final amounts of the expenditures, we have excluded them from the contractual obligations table above. Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Future Capital Needs In addition to the items set forth in Contractual Obligations above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment projects, Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax free exchange proceeds), short term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests typically range from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances more than 50%. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying 37 Table of Contents amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes or accounts receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our involvement with variable interest entities and see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our involvement with and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposure is to the availability of property debt of other cash sources to refund maturing property debt and to changes in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. Our libilities are not subject to any other material market rate or price risks. We use predominantly long term, fixed rate non recourse property debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings. We use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities, property sales proceeds, long term debt or equity financings. We use total rate of return swaps to obtain the benefit of variable rates on certain of our fixed rate debt instruments. We make limited use of other derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2011, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $220.2 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding and $37.0 million of variable rate preferred stock outstanding. Of the total debt subject to variable interest rates, floating rate tax exempt bond financing was approximately $179.0 million. Floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or SIFMA, rate, which since 1992 has averaged 75% of the 30 day LIBOR rate. If this historical relationship continues, we estimate that an increase in 30 day LIBOR of 100 basis points (75 basis points for tax exempt interest rates) with constant credit risk spreads would result in net income and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders being reduced (or the amounts of net loss and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders being increased) by $1.9 million on an annual basis. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $389.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and notes receivable, a portion of which bear interest at variable rates indexed to LIBOR based rates, and which may mitigate the effect of an increase in variable rates on our variable rate indebtedness and preferred stock discussed above. We estimate the fair value for our debt instruments using present value techniques that include income and market valuation approaches using market rates for debt with the same or similar terms. Present value calculations vary depending on the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In many cases, the fair value estimates may not be realizable in immediate settlement of the instruments. The estimated aggregate fair value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, 2011 ($4.9 billion on a proportionate basis). The combined carrying value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, 2011 ($4.7 billion on a proportionate basis). See Note 7 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further details on our consolidated debt. If market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our debt discussed above would have decreased from $5.4 billion to $5.1 billion (from $4.9 billion to $4.7 billion on a proportionate basis). If market rates for our debt discussed above were lower by 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion (from $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion on a proportionate basis).
