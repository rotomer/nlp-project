In addition, our $500 million senior revolving credit facility restricts payments of dividends in the event that an event of default under the facility has occurred or a proposed dividend payment would cause an event of default under the facility. The revolving credit facility provides for general events of default including: failure to pay principal of or interest on any loans under the revolving credit facility; failure to perform or comply with any convenant; breach of any representations or warranties made; default in the performance or compliance with any term that is not remedied or waived within a specified period of time; loss of any insurance license or certain regulatory actions if such action would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; acceleration of or failure to make payments in respect of debt exceeding a specified amount subject to any applicable grace period, or any breach or default with respect to any other material term of such debt; judgment defaults in excess of a specified amount; certain events of bankruptcy or dissolution; and failure to comply with certain ERISA matters. In addition, events of default include the acquisition of more than 30% of our voting power and or equity securities by any person or group (other than the existing control group). 43 Table of Contents Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities During the period from 2000 to 2003, pursuant to the Assurant Investment Plan, the Company granted to key employees, in exchange for all or a portion of such employees eligible compensation, options to purchase shares or other equity interests in certain third party mutual funds, which shares or other equity interests have been registered under the Securities Act.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance products and related services in North America and selected other markets. We provide: creditor placed homeowners insurance; manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended service contracts; individual health and small employer group health insurance; group dental insurance; group disability insurance; group life insurance and pre funded funeral insurance. The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive profit opportunities. 46 Table of Contents We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results of operations of FFG from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. As such, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Revenues We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Our investment portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads. Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death benefit growth rates on pre funded funeral insurance policies and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Expenses Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 18 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through 47 Table of Contents product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in December 2003 and January 2004, we redeemed all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to their aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and aggregate premium of approximately $206 million, all of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge credit facilities described under Liquidity and Capital Resources in connection with these redemptions. Regulation Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For other factors affecting our results of operations or financial condition, see Risk Factors. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following transactions: On October 10, 2002, we sold the Peer Review and Analysis division (PRA) of CORE, Inc. (CORE) to MCMC, LLC, an independent provider of medical analysis services. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of PRA. On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership in Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP) to NHP Holding LLC. We recorded pre tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. On December 31, 2001, we acquired Protective Life Corporations Dental Benefits Division (DBD), including the acquisition through reinsurance of Protectives indemnity dental, life and disability business and its prepaid dental subsidiaries. Total revenues of $305 million and income after tax of $15 million were generated by the DBD operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. DBD is included in Assurant Employee Benefits. On July 12, 2001, we acquired CORE, a national provider of employee absence management services. Total revenues of $31 million and income after tax of $0.2 million were generated by the CORE operations from July 12, 2001 through December 31, 2001, as compared to total revenues of $66 million and income after tax of $3 million in 2002. CORE is included in Assurant Employee Benefits. On April 2, 2001, we sold our FFG business to The Hartford primarily through a reinsurance arrangement. Total revenues of $146 million and income after tax of $8 million were generated by the FFG operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to total revenues of $669 million and income after tax of $65 million during 2000. FFG included certain individual life insurance policies, investment type annuity contracts and mutual fund operations. The sale of the mutual fund operations 48 Table of Contents resulted in $62 million of pre tax gains. The sale via reinsurance of the individual life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts resulted in $558 million of pre tax gains, which were deferred upon closing and are being amortized over the remaining life of the contracts. All activities related to FFG are included in the Corporate and Other segment. See Critical Accounting Policies. Prior to April 2, 2001, FFG had issued variable insurance products that are required to be registered as securities under the Securities Act. Variable insurance refers to an investment oriented life insurance policy that offers fixed premiums and a minimum death benefit as well as providing a return linked to an underlying portfolio of securities. These registered insurance contracts, which we no longer sell, have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford through modified coinsurance agreements. The Hartford administers this closed block of business pursuant to a third party administration agreement. Since this block of business was sold through modified coinsurance agreements, separate account assets and separate account liabilities associated with these products continue to be reflected in our financial statements. See the line items entitled Assets held in separate accounts and Liabilities related to separate accounts in our consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities created by these variable insurance policies are tied to the performance of underlying investments held in separate accounts of the insurance company that originally issued such policies. While we own the separate account assets, the laws governing separate accounts provide that the income, gains and losses from assets in the separate account are credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income, gains or losses of the insurer. Further, the laws provide that the separate account will not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer may conduct. The result of this structure is that the assets held in the separate account correspond to and are equal to the liabilities created by the variable insurance contracts. At December 31, 2003, we had separate account assets and liabilities of $3,805 million compared to $4,809 million on April 2, 2001, the date of the FFG sale. Comparing our results from period to period requires taking into account these acquisitions and dispositions. For a more detailed description of these acquisitions and dispositions, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Policies There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Premiums Short Duration Contracts Our short duration contracts are those on which we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term. Our short duration contracts primarily include: group term life, group disability medical and dental, property and warranty, credit life and disability, extended service contracts and individual medical issued after 2002 in most jurisdictions. Long Duration Contracts Currently, our long duration contracts being sold are pre funded funeral life insurance and investment type annuities. For pre funded funeral life insurance policies, any excess of the gross premium over the net premium is deferred and is recognized in income in a constant relationship with the insurance in force. For 49 Table of Contents pre funded funeral investment type annuity contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and traditional life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from policyholders. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively. Reinsurance Assumed Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates which are based on both payments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Fee Income We primarily derive income from fees received from providing administration services. Fee income is earned when services are performed. Reserves Reserves are established according to generally accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. 50 Table of Contents Short Duration Contracts For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. For group disability and group life, the case reserves and IBNR are recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the expected future claims payments. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. In July 2003, the valuation interest rate was lowered to 5.25% from 6% for group long term disability and raised to 5.25% from 3.5% for group term life waiver of premium reserves. Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the unexpired period of the policy. We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for IBNR of $37 million (before reinsurance) and $36 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at December 31, 2003. Any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos, environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $2.9 million, $1.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. One of our subsidiaries, (ARIC), participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased writing such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. We believe, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate. The inherent uncertainty 51 Table of Contents of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. Long Duration Contracts Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 or issued in the state of Minnesota and the traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of the future net premiums. These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral investment type annuities, universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, and the variable life insurance and investment type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded for these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. A premium deficiency is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations as a reduction of DAC to the extent that future policy premiums, including anticipation of interest income, are not adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Short Duration Contracts DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical issued in most jurisdictions after 2002, small group medical, group term life and group disability consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers, which are level, and compensation to representatives, which is spread out and is not front end loaded. These costs do not vary with the production of new business. As a result, these costs are not deferred but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. 52 Table of Contents Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed businesses were written off when the businesses were sold. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Changes in individual security values are monitored on a semi monthly basis in order to identify potential problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost. Each month the watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. Each quarter any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our 53 Table of Contents insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. Other Accounting Policies For a description of other accounting policies applicable to the periods covered by this report, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. New Accounting Standard On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Upon adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In addition, we were required to subject our goodwill to an initial impairment test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to conduct impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment event, our net income will be higher as a result of not having to amortize goodwill. As a result of this initial impairment test, we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,261 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. We also performed a January 1, 2003 impairment test during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and concluded that goodwill was not further impaired. See New Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of additional new accounting standards that are applicable to us. 54 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 6,157 $ 5,681 $ 5,242 Net investment income 607 632 712 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 2 (118 ) (119 ) Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses 68 80 68 Gain on disposal of businesses 11 62 Fees and other income 232 246 222 Total revenues 7,066 6,532 6,187 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (3,657 ) (3,435 ) (3,240 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses(1) (2,829 ) (2,609 ) (2,496 ) Amortization of goodwill (113 ) Interest expense (1 ) (14 ) Distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (113 ) (118 ) (118 ) Interest premiums on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (6,806 ) (6,162 ) (5,981 ) Income before income taxes 260 370 206 Income taxes (74 ) (110 ) (108 ) Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 186 260 98 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1,261 ) Net income (loss) $ 186 $ (1,001 ) $ 98 (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. Note: The table above includes amortization of goodwill in 2001 and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002. These items are only included in this Consolidated Overview. As a result, the tables presented under the segment discussions do not total to the same amounts shown on this consolidated overview table. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $534 million, or 8%, from $6,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 55 Table of Contents net earned premiums and other considerations is primarily due to increases of $285 million, $175 million, and $23 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $9 million in Assurant PreNeed. The increase in Assurant Solutions is due to growth in specialty property and consumer protection products. The increase in Assurant Health is primarily due to increases in individual health insurance business due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net investment income decreased by $25 million, or 4%, from $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment yields driven by the lower interest rate environment. The yield on average invested assets was 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada, and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million in the Corporate and Other segment. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no disposals in 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pretax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 6%, from $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002, associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $222 million, or 6%, from $3,435 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $3,657 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $144 million, $95 million, and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty property products, primarily creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health insurance business, which is consistent with growth in this business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,829 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $141 million, $43 million, and $11 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was consistent with growth in the specialty property and consumer protection products business. The increase in Assurant Health 56 Table of Contents was primarily due to increases in commissions, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general expenses, which was consistent with the growth in business. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in early January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million in interest premiums on redemption of subsidiary trusts for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in 2002. Net Income Net income increased by $1,187 million, or 119%, from a loss of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to a profit of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2003. Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or 33%, from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.6% compared to 29.7% in 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $345 million, or 6%, from $6,187 million in 2001 to $6,532 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $439 million, or 8%, from $5,242 million in 2001 to $5,681 million in 2002. Excluding the effect of the various acquisitions and dispositions described above, net earned premiums and other considerations increased mainly due to strong growth in Assurant Solutions primarily as a result of growth in new business and in Assurant PreNeed primarily due to an increase in the average size of policies sold by the AMLIC division. Net investment income decreased by $80 million, or 11%, from $712 million in 2001 to $632 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in achieved investment yields, driven by the lower interest rate environment and a decrease in average invested assets of $290 million. The yield on average invested assets was 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 6.83% for the year ended December 31, 2001. This reflected lower yields on fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages. Net realized losses on investments decreased by $1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to $118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other than temporary impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001 consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in Enron Corp. (Enron). Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from $68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a full year of amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of FFG as compared to nine months of amortization in 2001. This deferred gain on sale is discussed in more detail under Corporate and Other below. 57 Table of Contents Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to $11 million in 2002. The $62 million reflects the gain on the sale of FFGs mutual fund operations. The $11 million reflected the pre tax gain on the sale of NHP. Fees and other income increased by $24 million, or 11%, from $222 million in 2001 to $246 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a full year of fee income from CORE and an increase in fee income from Assurant Solutions, mainly from their credit insurance business transitioning to debt protection administration. In late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions credit insurance clients began a transition from use of our credit insurance products to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income rather than net earned premiums and where margins are lower than in the traditional credit insurance programs. However, because debt protection administration is not an insurance product, certain costs such as regulatory costs and cost of capital are expected to be eliminated as the transition from credit insurance to debt protection administration services continues. The fees from debt protection administration did not fully compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums The increases were partially offset by a $42 million, or 63%, decrease from the Corporate and Other segment due to the sale of FFG (partially through reinsurance), which had $65 million of fee income (generated from mutual fund operations included in such sale) in the first quarter of 2001. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $181 million, or 3%, from $5,981 million in 2001 to $6,162 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $195 million, or 6%, from $3,240 million in 2001 to $3,435 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the effects of the acquisitions and dispositions described above. The increases were also partially offset by an $84 million, or 6%, decrease from Assurant Health, primarily due to a higher mix of individual health insurance business, which generally has a lower expected loss ratio relative to small employer group business, disciplined pricing and product design changes. (Loss premiums and other considerations include the amount of net premiums allocable to the expired period of an insurance policy or policies, including fees earned on interest sensitive policies). Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $113 million, or 5%, from $2,496 million in 2001 to $2,609 million in 2002. Assurant Employee Benefits contributed $106 million of this increase, primarily due to the DBD and CORE acquisitions. This increase was offset by a $65 million decrease in the Corporate and Other segment due to the sale of FFG. Selling, underwriting and general expenses in Assurant Health increased by $50 million, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of DAC and due to costs associated with higher employee compensation and investments in technology. Also, selling, underwriting and general expenses in Assurant PreNeed increased by $17 million, primarily due to an increase in amortization of DAC and VOBA as a result of an increase in sales of single pay policies and increases in general expenses. Amortization of goodwill was zero in 2002 compared to $113 million in 2001, as a result of our adoption of FAS 142 as described above. Interest expense decreased from $14 million in 2001 to $0 in 2002. In April 2001, we used a portion of the FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of outstanding debt owed to Fortis Finance N.V. (Fortis Finance), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortis. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at $118 million. Net Income Net income decreased by $1,099 million from a profit of $98 million in 2001 to a loss of $1,001 million in 2002. 58 Table of Contents Income taxes increased by $2 million, or 2%, from $108 million in 2001 to $110 million in 2002. The effective tax rate for 2002 was 29.7% compared to 52.4% in 2001. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the elimination of amortization of goodwill in 2002. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect (expense) of change in accounting principle of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2001. Assurant Solutions Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,362 $ 2,077 $ 1,906 Net investment income 187 205 218 Fees and other income 129 119 98 Total revenues 2,678 2,401 2,222 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (899 ) (755 ) (640 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (1,590 ) (1,449 ) (1,444 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,489 ) (2,204 ) (2,084 ) Segment income before income tax 189 197 138 Income taxes (56 ) (65 ) (40 ) Segment income after tax $ 133 $ 132 $ 98 Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Specialty Property Solutions(1) $ 733 $ 552 $ 452 Consumer Protection Solutions(2) 1,629 1,525 1,454 Total $ 2,362 $ 2,077 $ 1,906 (1) Specialty Property Solutions includes a variety of specialized property insurance programs that are coupled with differentiated administrative capabilities. (2) Consumer Protection Solutions includes an array of debt protection administration services, credit insurance programs and warranties and extended service contracts. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $277 million, or 12%, from $2,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $285 million, or 14%, from $2,077 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $180 million of additional net earned premiums and other considerations attributable to our special property products, which includes approximately $133 million from our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners insurance lines of business generated from new clients and increased sales growth from our existing clients. Consumer protection products also 59 Table of Contents contributed $105 million in net earned premiums and other considerations primarily from growth in our warranty and extended service contracts business. Net investment income decreased by $18 million, or 9%, from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The average portfolio yield dropped 62 basis points from 5.85% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.23% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 2%. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 8%, from $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the continuing transition of our credit insurance business to our debt protection administration business. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $144 million, or 19%, from $755 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our specialty property products accounted for $112 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business and approximately $18 million of the increase is attributable to various catastrophes ($30 million in 2003 compared to $12 million in 2002). Our consumer protection products also contributed $32 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our warranty and extended service contracts line of business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling and underwriting expenses increased by $116 million, which consisted of $45 million primarily from our specialty property products due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of the increase was from our consumer protection products due to increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract lines of business. General expenses increased by $25 million, primarily from start up costs related to setting up new clients in the creditor placed homeowners insurance area and increased business from our warranty and extended service contract products. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $1 million, or 1%, from $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the decrease in investment income of $13 million after tax, segment income after tax increased by $14 million, or 11%. Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or 14%, from $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 8%, from $2,222 million in 2001 to $2,401 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $171 million, or 9%, from $1,906 million in 2001 to $2,077 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to approximately $100 million of additional net earned premiums from our specialty property solutions products, including approximately $86 million from the growth of our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance, flood insurance and manufactured housing related property coverages. Consumer protection solutions contributed an additional $71 million to the increase in net earned premiums primarily due to the growth of $39 million attributable to our warranty and extended service contracts business and $58 million from an accidental death and dismemberment product, 60 Table of Contents which we started selling in 2001 and stopped selling in 2002. These increases were partly offset by the decrease in credit insurance products as the transition from credit insurance products to debt protection administration programs continued and fees from debt protection administration programs did not fully compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums. See Item 1 Business Operating Business Segments Assurant Solutions Consumer Protection Solutions. Net investment income decreased by $13 million, or 6%, from $218 million in 2001 to $205 million in 2002. The average portfolio yield dropped 51 basis points from 6.36% in 2001 to 5.85% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment. This decrease was partially offset by the reinvestment of tax advantaged investments, such as preferred stock, low income housing tax credit investments and tax exempt municipal bonds, into higher yield taxable investments. Also, average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 2%. Fees and other income increased by $21 million, or 21%, from $98 million in 2001 to $119 million in 2002, including $13 million in additional fee income resulting from our credit insurance business transitioning to debt protection administration services. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $120 million, or 6%, from $2,084 million in 2001 to $2,204 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $115 million, or 18%, from $640 million in 2001 to $755 million in 2002. Consumer protection solutions benefits contributed $98 million of this increase due primarily to $36 million from the warranty and extended service contracts business and $24 million from an accidental death and disability product. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in benefits in credit insurance products, which related to the decrease in premiums resulting from the transition to debt protection administration products. The growth of our specialty property solutions product lines also contributed a further $17 million to the increase in policyholder benefits in 2002, including approximately $11 million of losses related to Hurricane Lili and Arizona wildfires. In 2001, we had approximately $10 million in losses related to tropical storm Allison. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $5 million, or less than 1%, from $1,444 million in 2001 to $1,449 million in 2002. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees contributed $21 million to the increase. The increase was primarily in our specialty property solutions business from the growth in the creditor placed homeowners and manufactured housing homeowners insurance products. This increase was offset by a decrease in general expenses of $16 million primarily due to a non recurring cost incurred in 2001. Segment Income After Tax As a result of the foregoing, segment income after tax increased by $34 million, or 35%, from $98 million in 2001 to $132 million in 2002. Income taxes increased $25 million, or 62%, from $40 million in 2001 to $65 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a 43% increase in segment income before income tax. The majority of the remaining increase was due to an increase in our effective tax rate primarily due to our decision to reduce our ownership of tax advantaged investments. 61 Table of Contents Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions except membership data) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,009 $ 1,834 $ 1,838 Net investment income 49 55 58 Fees and other income 33 23 14 Total revenues 2,091 1,912 1,910 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (1,317 ) (1,222 ) (1,306 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (589 ) (546 ) (496 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,906 ) (1,768 ) (1,802 ) Segment income before income tax 185 144 108 Income taxes (64 ) (49 ) (37 ) Segment income after tax $ 121 $ 95 $ 71 Loss ratio(1) 65.6 % 66.6 % 71.1 % Expense ratio(2) 28.9 % 29.4 % 26.8 % Combined ratio(3) 93.3 % 95.2 % 97.3 % Membership by product line (in thousands): Individual 761 670 600 Small employer group 376 355 420 Total 1,137 1,025 1,020 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

(3) The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 9.0%, from $1,912 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $175 million, or 10%, from $1,834 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,009 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance business increased $156 million due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance business increased $19 million primarily because we instituted premium rate increases in select small group markets to sufficiently price for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for anticipated future medical trends. 62 Table of Contents Net investment income decreased by $6 million, or 11%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 69 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 6.43% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.74% for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the lower interest rate environment. Offsetting the decrease in yield was a 5% increase in average invested assets for the year ended December 31, 2003, over the comparable prior year period. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 43%, from $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets, such as sales of our non insurance health access discount cards. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $138 million, or 8%, from $1,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,906 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $95 million, or 8%, from $1,222 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was consistent with the increase in net earned premiums and other considerations. The loss ratio improved 100 basis points from 66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to our risk management activities. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $43 million, or 8%, from $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Commissions increased by $33 million corresponding to an increase in first year net earned premiums over the prior year. Taxes, licenses and fees decreased by $6 million due to reduced premium tax rates on a portion of the medical premium. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $7 million due to higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General expenses increased by $9 million mainly due to additional spending to improve claims experience. The expense ratio improved 50 basis points from 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $26 million, or 27%, from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income taxes increased by $15 million, or 31%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 28% increase in segment income before income tax during the year ended December 31, 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues remained virtually unchanged from 2001 to 2002, at $1,910 million in 2001 as compared to $1,912 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations also remained stable from 2001 to 2002, at $1,838 million in 2001 as compared to $1,834 million in 2002, with an increase of $142 million in 2002 in the net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance products being offset by a decrease of $146 million during such year in net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance products. Net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance business increased due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance business decreased due to declining membership, partially offset by small employer group premium rate increases that we instituted in selected markets to adequately price for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for anticipated future medical trends. 63 Table of Contents Net investment income decreased by $3 million, or 5%, from $58 million in 2001 to $55 million in 2002. There was a 96 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.39% in 2001 to 6.43% in 2002 mainly due to the lower interest rate environment. Partially offset by the decrease in yield was a 7.7% increase in average allocated invested assets in 2002. Fees and other income increased by $9 million, or 64%, from $14 million in 2001 to $23 million in 2002 due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in our individual health insurance business. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $34 million, or 2%, from $1,802 million in 2001 to $1,768 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits decreased by $84 million, or 6%, from $1,306 million in 2001 to $1,222 million in 2002. This decrease was principally due to a higher mix of individual health insurance business which had a lower loss ratio relative to small employer group health insurance business, primarily due to disciplined pricing and product design changes. The loss ratio improved 450 basis points from 71.1% in 2001 to 66.6% in 2002 due primarily to the higher mix of individual health insurance business, increased premium rates and product design changes. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $50 million, or 10%, from $496 million in 2001 to $546 million in 2002. Taxes, licenses and fees increased by $5 million in 2002, or 13%, due to a change in the mix of business by state and legal entity, and the loss of favorable consolidated premium tax return benefits triggered by the disposition of FFG. The amortization of DAC increased by $21 million in 2002, or 49%, due to higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General expenses increased by $34 million in 2002, or 13%, due to investments in technology, higher employee compensation and additional spending to achieve loss ratio improvements. Partially offsetting these increases was a $10 million, or 7%, decrease in commissions due to a higher mix of first year individual health insurance business. Individual health insurance policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized in subsequent years. The expense ratio increased by 260 basis points from 26.8% in 2001 to 29.4% in 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher commissions on the mix of business in individual health insurance, investments in technology, higher employee compensation and additional spending to achieve loss ratio improvements. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $24 million, or 34%, from $71 million in 2001 to $95 million in 2002. Income taxes increased by $12 million, or 32%, from $37 million in 2001 to $49 million in 2002. The increase was consistent with the 33% increase in segment income before income tax in 2002. 64 Table of Contents Assurant Employee Benefits Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee Benefits segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002(4) 2001(4) (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,256 $ 1,233 $ 934 Net investment income 140 148 144 Fees and other income 54 74 39 Total revenues 1,450 1,455 1,117 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (921 ) (945 ) (738 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (433 ) (422 ) (316 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,354 ) (1,367 ) (1,054 ) Segment income before income tax 96 88 63 Income taxes (34 ) (31 ) (22 ) Segment income after tax $ 62 $ 57 $ 41 Loss ratio(1) 73.3 % 76.6 % 79.0 % Expense ratio(2) 33.1 % 32.3 % 32.5 % Premium persistency ratio(3) 79.9 % 79.9 % 84.3 % Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Group dental $ 539 $ 554 $ 257 Group disability 461 400 398 Group life 256 279 279 Total $ 1,256 $ 1,233 $ 934 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations. (2) The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income. (3) The premium persistency ratio is equal to the rate at which existing business for all issue years at the beginning of the period remains in force at the end of the period. The calculations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 exclude DBD. (4) We acquired DBD on December 31, 2001 and CORE on July 12, 2001; therefore, the results of DBD and CORE are included in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment financial results beginning in 2002 and July 2001, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less than 1%, from $1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 65 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $61 million of additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS. Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition, dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven by lower sales and the non renewal of a large account. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003, which was unchanged from 2002. Net investment income decreased by $8 million, or 5%, from $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 65 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.04% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. Average invested assets increased by 8% from 2002 to 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $20 million, or 27%, from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee revenue from CORE due to the sale of PRA. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by $13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits decreased by $24 million, or 3%, from $945 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was driven by favorable development in disability claims and lower claim volume due to the reduction in dental and group life net earned premiums. In addition, during the third quarter of 2003, we completed reserve studies for the group disability, group life, and group dental products, which concluded that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant. Adjustments were made to reserves to reflect current mortality and morbidity experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million. The benefits loss ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in 2003. Excluding the reserve release discussed above, the benefits loss ratio would have been 74.7% in 2003. This improvement was driven primarily by favorable disability experience. Selling, underwriting, and general expenses increased by $11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio increased from 32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to a $6.2 million write down of previously capitalized software related to our new administration system. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $5 million, or 9%, from $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income tax expense increased by $3 million, or 10%, from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 9% increase in segment income before tax. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $338 million, or 30%, from $1,117 million in 2001 to $1,455 million in 2002, substantially all of which was attributable to the acquisition of DBD. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $299 million, or 32%, from $934 million in 2001 to $1,233 million in 2002. Excluding the $299 million increase in net earned premiums due to the 66 Table of Contents acquisition of DBD, net earned premiums were unchanged at $934 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily because new business was offset by non renewal of certain unprofitable business. An additional contributing factor was increased pressure on ancillary employee benefits provided by employer groups due to increased medical costs. Premium persistency (excluding the DBD acquisition) decreased by 440 basis points from 84.3% for 2001 to 79.9% for 2002 because of disciplined underwriting and reduced employment in renewed groups. Net investment income increased by $4 million from $144 million in 2001 to $148 million in 2002 mainly due to the DBD acquisition. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in investment yields by 36 basis points from 7.52% in 2001 to 7.16% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment. Fees and other income increased by $35 million, or 90%, from $39 million in 2001 to $74 million in 2002 primarily due to a full year of fee revenue from CORE, which was acquired on July 12, 2001. CORE fee revenue was $66 million in 2002, as compared to the half year of revenue recorded in 2001 of $31 million. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $313 million, or 30%, from $1,054 million in 2001 to $1,367 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $207 million, or 28%, from $738 million in 2001 to $945 million in 2002. Excluding the $197 million increase related to the acquisition of DBD, policyholder benefits increased by $10 million, or 1%, driven by growth in group dental premiums. Our loss ratio improved 240 basis points from 79.0% in 2001 to 76.6% in 2002. Excluding the effect of the DBD acquisition, the loss ratio in 2002 was 80.1%, which was higher than in 2001 due to slight deterioration in group dental and group life experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $106 million, or 34%, from $316 million in 2001 to $422 million in 2002 primarily due to the DBD and CORE acquisitions. The expense ratio was virtually unchanged between 2001 and 2002. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $16 million, or 39%, from $41 million in 2001 to $57 million in 2002. Income taxes increased by $9 million, or 41%, from $22 million in 2001 to $31 million in 2002. The increase was consistent with the 40% increase in segment income before income tax. 67 Table of Contents Assurant PreNeed Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant PreNeeds segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 529 $ 538 $ 507 Net investment income 188 184 179 Fees and other income 5 5 3 Total revenues 722 727 689 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (521 ) (513 ) (486 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (146 ) (137 ) (120 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (667 ) (650 ) (606 ) Segment income before income tax 55 77 83 Income taxes (19 ) (27 ) (29 ) Segment income after tax $ 36 $ 50 $ 54 Net earned premiums and other considerations by channel: AMLIC $ 283 $ 293 $ 278 Independent 246 245 229 Total $ 529 $ 538 $ 507 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, or 1%, from $727 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $722 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $9 million, or 2%, from $538 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $529 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel which was caused by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI, AMLICs principal customer. Net investment income increased by $4 million, or 2%, from $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. A 8% increase in average invested assets was offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the annualized investment yield, which was 6.91% at December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at December 31, 2003. The increase in average invested assets was due to a larger inforce block of business. The rate decline reduced net investment income by $10 million over the comparable prior year period. The decline in yields was due to the lower interest rate environment and the restructuring of the portfolio in 2002 to improve credit quality. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $17 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 68 Table of Contents Policyholder benefits increased by $8 million, or 2%, from $513 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase is due to the increase in business written and other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies use a Consumer Price Index rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition, benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $9 million, or 7%, from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and VOBA expense increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force block of business. Overall general operating expenses before deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable prior year period due to expense control. This reduction includes a $0.7 million charge associated with restructuring of the sales force in our independent division. Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the prior year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $14 million, or 28%, from $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was caused primarily by smaller spreads between investment income earned and the fixed benefits credited to policyholders, increased growth credited on the Consumer Price Index block of business and higher utilization of the early pay off feature. Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or 30%, from $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment income before tax. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $38 million, or 6%, from $689 million in 2001 to $727 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $31 million, or 6%, from $507 million in 2001 to $538 million in 2002. The increase was driven by a $15 million increase in net earned premiums in 2002 in our AMLIC channel due to an increase in the average size of the policies sold and increased earned premiums from the independent channel due to increased sales through expansion of pre need counselors. Policy size increased due to a change in packaging of funerals sold by SCI. Net investment income increased by $5 million, or 3%, from $179 million in 2001 to $184 million in 2002. An 8% increase in average allocated invested assets in 2002 resulting from the growth in force policies resulted in additional investment income in 2002. Offsetting the increase in invested assets was a 34 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.91% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment and restructuring of the investment portfolio to enhance credit quality. The decline in yields reduced investment income in 2002. Fees and other income increased by $2 million, or 66%, from $3 million in 2001 to $5 million in 2002. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $44 million, or 7%, from $606 million in 2001 to $650 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $27 million, or 6%, from $486 million in 2001 to $513 million in 2002. The increase in policyholder benefits was consistent with the increase in business written, partially offset by other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies uses a Consumer Price Index rate as a growth rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate decreased from 3.36% in 2001 to 1.97% in 69 Table of Contents 2002. This reduced policyholder benefits by $6 million in 2002. In addition, benefit expense increased by $3 million from 2001 to 2002 related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversion from limited pay policies to single pay policies. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $17 million, or 14%, from $120 million in 2001 to $137 million in 2002. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in amortization of DAC and VOBA of $12 million in 2002, as a result of the increased sales of single pay policies versus plans paid over a three , five and ten year period. The acquisition costs on single pay policies are amortized in the year of issue, thus causing the increase in expense levels in 2002 over 2001. All other expenses increased by $5 million in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to the increase in premiums. Our mix of business has been moving toward more single pay policies relative to multi pay policies increasing our expenses in any given year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $4 million, or 7%, from $54 million in 2001 to $50 million in 2002. This was caused primarily by smaller spreads between our investment yields and rates we credited to our policyholders. Also, profits were lower due to higher utilization of the early pay off feature described above and higher mortality, offset by the lower Consumer Price Index credited growth. Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 7%, from $29 million in 2001 to $27 million in 2002, which was largely consistent with the 7% decrease in segment income before income tax. Corporate and Other Overview The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results of operations of FFG, from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of FFG and LTC. 70 Table of Contents The table below presents information regarding Corporate and Others segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ $ $ 58 Net investment income 43 40 112 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 2 (118 ) (119 ) Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 68 80 68 Gain on disposal of businesses 11 62 Fees and other income 11 25 67 Total revenues 124 38 248 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (70 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (69 ) (55 ) (120 ) Interest expense (1 ) (14 ) Distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (113 ) (118 ) (118 ) Interest premiums on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (389 ) (173 ) (322 ) Segment income before income tax (265 ) (135 ) (74 ) Income taxes 99 61 21 Segment income after tax $ (166 ) $ (74 ) $ (53 ) As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $393 million (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. The Corporate and Other segments financial results were affected by the April 2, 2001 sale of FFG. Below are the results of FFG that have been included in the Corporate and Other segment from January 1, 2001 through March 31, 2001. 71 Table of Contents January 1 through March 31, 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 49 Net investment income 32 Fees and other income 65 Total revenues 146 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (48 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (86 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (134 ) Income before income tax 12 Income taxes (4 ) Income after tax $ 8 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $86 million, or 226%, from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net investment income increased by $3 million, or 8%, from $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 56%, from $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in 2002 associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily 72 Table of Contents due to $14 million of consulting and compensation expenses incurred in 2003, related to our initial public offering in February 2004. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million of interest premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero recognized in 2002. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $92 million, or 124%, from $74 million in 2002 to $166 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to the $206 million of interest premiums incurred related to early extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, partially offset by the favorable $120 million change in net realized capital gains (losses) on investments. Income tax benefit increased by $38 million, or 62%, from $61 million in 2002 to $99 million in 2003. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $210 million, or 85%, from $248 million in 2001 to $38 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $58 million, or 100%, from $58 million in 2001 to zero in 2002 due to the sale of FFG. Net investment income decreased by $72 million, or 64%, from $112 million in 2001 to $40 million in 2002. Excluding the $32 million reduction in investment income from the sale of FFG, net investment income decreased in 2002 as a result of a decrease in invested assets because we paid down debt and acquired CORE and DBD. Net realized losses on investments decreased by $1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to $118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other than temporary impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001 consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in Enron. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from $68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002, mainly due a to full year of amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of FFG as compared to nine months of amortization in 2001. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to $11 million in 2002. This decrease was due to the sale of FFGs mutual fund operations. Also, on June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million in 2002. Fees and other income decreased by $42 million, or 63%, from $67 million in 2001 to $25 million in 2002. Excluding the $65 million reduction in other income due to the sale of FFG, fees and other income increased by $23 million in 2002 mainly due to approximately $15 million of income associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. 73 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $149 million, or 46%, from $322 million in 2001 to $173 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits decreased by $70 million, or 100%, from $70 million in 2001 to zero in 2002. The decrease was entirely due to the sale of FFG. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $65 million, or 54%, from $120 million in 2001 to $55 million in 2002. Excluding the $86 million reduction in selling, underwriting and general expenses attributable to the sale of FFG, these expenses increased by $21 million from 2001 to 2002. Interest expense decreased by $14 million, or 100%, from $14 million in 2001 to zero in 2002. We used a portion of the FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of debt owed to Fortis Finance. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at $118 million. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $21 million, or 40%, from a $53 million loss in 2001 to a $74 million loss in 2002, primarily due to the sale of FFG. Income taxes increased by $40 million, or 190%, from $21 million in 2001 to $61 million in 2002. Excluding the $4 million reduction in income tax expenses due to the sale of FFG, income tax benefit increased by $44 million in 2002. The change in the income tax benefit was largely consistent with the increase in segment losses before income tax. In 2002, we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Fixed maturities $ 8,729 80 % $ 8,036 80 % $ 7,630 79 % Equity securities 456 4 272 3 247 3 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 933 9 842 8 869 9 Policy loans 68 1 69 1 68 1 Short term investments 276 2 684 7 627 6 Other investments 462 4 181 1 209 2 Total investments $ 10,924 100 % $ 10,084 100 % $ 9,650 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 70% and 75% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. As interest rates decrease, the market value of fixed maturity securities increases. 74 Table of Contents The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (pre tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,230 $ 7,631 $ 7,471 Net unrealized gains 499 405 159 Fair value $ 8,729 $ 8,036 $ 7,630 Equities: Cost $ 437 $ 265 $ 243 Net unrealized gains 19 7 4 Fair value $ 456 $ 272 $ 247 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $94 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The increase in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the decline in investment grade corporate securities yield spreads combined with an increase in Treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade corporate securities fell by approximately 119 basis points while yields on 10 year Treasury securities increased by 44 basis points between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $246 million, or 155%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. This reflected the impact of declining market interest rates. Yields on 10 year U.S. Treasury bonds decreased by 121 basis points from 5.03% at December 31, 2001, to 3.82% at December 31, 2002. Net unrealized gains on equity securities increased by $12 million, or 171%, from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003 and by $3 million, or 75%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Reserves The following table presents reserve information as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Future policy benefits and expenses $ 6,235 $ 5,807 $ 5,547 Unearned premiums 3,134 3,208 3,267 Claims and benefits payable 3,513 3,374 3,250 Total policy liabilities $ 12,882 $ 12,389 $ 12,064 Future policy benefits and expenses increased by $428 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and by $260 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. Unearned premiums decreased by $74 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and by $59 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The decrease is primarily driven by the run off of our credit life and disability contracts, offset by growth in other short duration contracts. Claims and benefits payable increased by $139 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and increased by $124 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. 75 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Future Future Policy Claims Policy Claims Benefits and Benefits and and Unearned Benefits and Unearned Benefits Expenses Premiums Payable Expenses Premiums Payable (In millions) Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 2,276 $ 3 $ 14 $ 1,991 $ 3 $ 15 Life insurance no longer offered 688 1 4 693 1 5 Universal life and annuities no longer offered 322 1 17 334 1 12 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,744 48 177 2,619 48 139 All other 205 57 151 170 75 167 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 13 394 11 457 Group disability 4 1,375 4 1,299 Medical 67 266 43 202 Dental 7 39 8 44 Property and warranty 1,149 621 1,135 536 Credit life and disability 759 403 1,074 445 Extended service contracts 1,023 18 803 16 All other 2 34 2 37 Total policy liabilities $ 6,235 $ 3,134 $ 3,513 $ 5,807 $ 3,208 $ 3,374 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Long Duration The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Pre Funded Funeral Life Insurance Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Loss recognition testing is performed annually. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. 76 Table of Contents Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $52 million higher (or lower). If claim termination rates were 10% lower (or higher) than currently assumed, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $38 million higher (or lower). The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $13 million higher (or lower). As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Disability incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $53 million more, $3 million less and $7 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Group Disability reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003, and its related upward revision reflects the result of reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based on results of those studies, reserves were increased by $44 million, almost all of which was attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to reflect current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability reserve redundancies in 2002 and 2001, which were less than 1% of prior year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning of year case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year case reserves. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Term Life incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $93 million, $29 million and $35 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A significant portion of the Group Term Life reserve is related to waiver of premium reserves for disabled claimants. Group Term Life waiver of premium reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. Reductions in the Group Term Life reserves reflected the results of reserve adequacy studies conducted in the third quarter of 2003. Based on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by $59 million. The change in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested assets, and recent mortality and recovery 77 Table of Contents experience. Another portion of the Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years described above, was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our beginning of year reserves and recovery rates being higher than assumed in our beginning of year waiver of premium reserves. The remaining redundancy and related downward revision were due to shorter than expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid claim dates. These amounts were offset by one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year waiver of premium reserves. The conclusion of the reserve studies determined that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million, which includes $3 million of reserve release relating to the group dental business. Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss development factors for the most recent four months would result in approximately $22 million higher (or lower) reserves at December 31, 2003. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 85% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in our Medical business related to prior years were $58 million, $43 million and $48 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the short tail nature of this business, these developments relate to claims incurred in the preceding year (i.e., in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The redundancies in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical reserve estimates, were caused by our claims developing more favorably than expected. Our actual claims experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and lower medical inflation than assumed in our prior year pricing and reserving processes. The differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates, medical provider utilization and medical inflation reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages which we no longer write (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. 78 Table of Contents We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate of reserves is selected from the middle to upper end of third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in our Property and Warranty lines of business related to prior years were $13 million less, $2 million more and $27 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The redundancy in our Property and Warranty lines of business, and the related downward revisions in our estimated reserves in 2001 occurred mostly in our credit unemployment and credit property insurance coverages, whereas the other coverages showed immaterial adjustments to prior years incurred losses. The small deficiency in 2002 largely reflected a shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional development and the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, resulting in a modest redundancy. These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual claim frequencies differing from the best estimate claim frequencies, and differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the periods they emerge. For the longer tail Property and Warranty coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident), there were no changes in estimated amounts for incurred claims in prior years for all years. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years, and the related downward revisions in estimated reserves, was attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in the results of operations. Reinsurance The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of As of December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Reinsurance recoverables $ 4,445 $ 4,650 Reinsurance recoverables decreased by $205 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,410 million at December 31, 2003 and $2,255 million at December 31, 2002. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2003 2002 (In millions) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,551 $ 2,452 Ceded unearned premium 971 1,277 Ceded claims and benefits payable 788 744 Ceded paid losses 135 177 Total $ 4,445 $ 4,650 79 Table of Contents We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases to facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal entities with business segments that we retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still reflected in our balance sheet. The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was $1,537 million and $1,558 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was $873 million and $697 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We would be responsible for administering this business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a default by reinsurers. Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows 80 Table of Contents depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2003, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was $290 million. For a discussion of the various restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, see Item 1 Business Regulation and Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy. Dividends and other interest income paid by our subsidiaries totaled $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $615.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Figures for 2001 were higher due to a gain on the sale of FFG. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to perform other acquisitions, to make interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend payments to our stockholders. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. Historically, Fortis has maintained a $1 billion commercial paper facility that we have been able to access (via intercompany loans) for up to $750 million. We use the commercial paper facility to cover any cash shortfalls, which may occur from time to time. During 2003, we accessed $75 million of this facility for 3 days in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. We had no commercial paper borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2001, $217 million in commercial paper was issued and redeemed. There was no outstanding commercial paper at year end 2001. In connection with our separation from Fortis, we no longer have access to this facility. In March 2004, we intend to establish a $500 million commercial paper program, which will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at the subsidiary level. In December 2003, we entered into two senior bridge credit facilities of $650 million and $1,100 million. The aggregate indebtedness of $1,750 million under the facility was in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. On January 30, 2004, we entered into a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are not in default. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. As of March 11, 2004 we are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. On February 5, 2004, we received a $725.5 million capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with the closing IPO. The proceeds from that contribution were used to repay the $650 million of outstanding indebtedness under the senior bridge credit facility and $75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition, we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the 81 Table of Contents $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our $975 million senior note offering described below. On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975 million. The first series is $500 million in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our $1.1 billion senior bridge facility. At the time of offering our senior notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement. The registration rights agreement requires us to file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the exchange of the senior notes for registered notes having nearly identical terms as the senior notes or to permit the registered resale of the senior notes. If we fail to comply with the filing requirements under our registration rights agreement within certain time periods, the interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase. Our qualified pension plan was under funded by $60 million at December 31, 2003. In accordance with ERISA, there is no expected minimum funding requirement for 2004 or 2005. Our nonqualified plan, which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of $72 million at December 31, 2003. The expected Company payments to retirees under this plan are approximately $4 million per year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our post retirement plans (other than pension), which are partially funded with $7 million of assets, had an accumulated post retirement benefit obligation of $51 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the expected Company payments to retirees and dependents under the postretirement plan are approximately $1.2 million per year in 2004 and 2005. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. We estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our name change and rebranding initiative will be approximately $10 million, which we will expense in 2004. We are not currently planning to make any other significant capital expenditures in 2004 or 2005. During January 2004 we paid to participants in the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of $25 million in connection with the cash out of all outstanding Fortis, Inc. incentive rights. See Item 11 Executive Compensation Long Term Incentive Plan Awards. In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs. 82 Table of Contents The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 741 $ 365 $ 632 Investing activities (711 ) (380 ) (218 ) Financing activities 317 (43 ) (380 ) Net change in cash $ 347 $ (58 ) $ 34 Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The key changes of the net cash inflow of $347 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,929 million, maturities of these securities of $1,131 million, and issuance of debt in the amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,164 million and maturities of these securities of $858 million. Key changes of the net cash inflow of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 were the sale of FFG for $385 million in cash and changes in our revenues and expenses from operating activities as described above. At December 31, 2003, we had total debt outstanding of $1,970 million, as compared to $1,471 million at December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2003 this debt consisted of $1,750 million of two senior bridge credit facility arrangements, $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and $24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 this debt consisted of trust capital securities, which we classify as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and a small amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, Security 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts and interest paid $ 128,694 $ 117,114 $ 133,667 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends 963 1,052 1,053 Class A Common Stock dividends 139,310 67,000 Class B and C Common Stock dividends 41,877 41,876 42,298 Total $ 310,844 $ 160,042 $ 244,018 83 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2003, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less than More than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In thousands) Contractual obligations: Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts $ 196,224 $ $ $ $ 196,224 Debt 1,750,000 1,750,000 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 24,160 24,160 Operating leases 39,622 67,406 48,802 44,533 200,363 Commitments: Interest premiums on redemption of preferred securities of subsidiary trusts 66,734 66,734 Investment purchases Outstanding: unsettled trades 39,552 39,552 commercial mortgage loans on real estate 75,900 75,900 other investments 22,429 22,429 Total obligations and commitments $ 2,190,461 $ 67,406 $ 48,802 $ 68,693 $ 2,375,362 In December 2003 and January 2004, we redeemed all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to their aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and aggregate premium of approximately $206 million, all of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge credit facilities described under Liquidity and Capital Resources in connection with these redemptions. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $118 million and $120 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, we had an unused $50 million letter of credit facility. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Company Our profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business. Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties with which we do business are important to the success of our business segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with several mortgage lenders 84 Table of Contents and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers and other financial institutions through which we distribute our products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution relationships for our individual health insurance products with IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm USAA and Mutual of Omaha, as well as a relationship with Health Advocates Alliance, the association through which we provide many of our individual health insurance products through Assurant Healths agreement dated September 1, 2003 with its administrator, National Administration Company, Inc. The agreement that provides for our exclusive distribution relationship with IPSI terminates in July 2004, but may be extended if agreed to by both parties. We also maintain contractual relationships with several separate networks of health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. In Assurant PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one to five years. Although we believe we have generally been successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to terminate these arrangements, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services, which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with PPOs could also lead to higher medical or dental costs and or a loss of members to other medical or dental plans. For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few clients over the last three years as a result of bankruptcies and termination of contracts either by it or its clients; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. At Assurant Health, client turnover increased slightly over the last three years from issues related to the slowing economy, particularly in 2001 through early 2003; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Similar to Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits client turnover increased slightly over the last three years from issues related to the slowing economy, particularly in 2001 through early 2003, such as companies going out of business and businesses no longer providing benefits; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Assurant PreNeed terminated client relationships with three funeral home groups in 2003 because of profitability issues with the business; however, none of the clients terminated was significant to its business. Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or develop and maintain distribution sources. We distribute our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels including: independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life agents, financial institutions, funeral directors, association groups and other third party marketing organizations. We do not distribute our insurance products and services through captive or affiliated agents except for a small number of affiliated agents at Assurant Health. Our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. In Assurant Health, we depend in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on associations, including Health Advocates Alliance, in the marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our customers, market and distribute our products. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us and usually also market products of our competitors. Strong competition exists among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales representatives, agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. In addition, by relying on independent agents and brokers to distribute products for us, we face continued competition from our competitors products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory environment. Recently, the marketing of health insurance through association groups has come under increased scrutiny. An interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various third party distributors or our inability to respond to regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 85 Table of Contents We have our own sales representatives whose role in the distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. General economic, financial market and political conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions. These conditions include economic cycles such as insurance industry cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer lending, levels of inflation and movements of the financial markets. Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy, demographics, and legislative and competitive factors also influence our performance. During periods of economic downturn: individuals and businesses may choose not to purchase our insurance products and other related products and services, may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased or, in Assurant Employee Benefits and in small group employer health insurance in Assurant Health, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to rising unemployment levels; new disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise; there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment levels; and insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits. In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our pre funded funeral insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index. Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and capital. We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles (SAP), do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. During the past three years, we did not experience substantial deviations in actual claims losses from reserve estimates previously established. However, future loss 86 Table of Contents development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss limitation methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and property coverages. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by: changes in health and dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments. The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes, by insurance regulations, existing contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions or other factors. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads. Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death benefit growth rates on pre funded funeral insurance policies and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves related to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on current interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and or new claims would need to be calculated using lower discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates. Catastrophe losses, including man made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other personal business lines. We have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, 87 Table of Contents catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics, or can be man made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible that both the frequency and severity of man made catastrophes will increase and that we will not be able to implement exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance for such catastrophes. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal lines coverages, which for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents approximately 24% of our net earned premiums and other considerations in our Assurant Solutions segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2003, approximately 34% of the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal lines relates to properties located in California, Florida and Texas. As a result of our creditor placed homeowners insurance product, our concentration in these areas may increase in the future. This is because in our creditor placed homeowners insurance line, we agree to provide homeowners insurance coverage automatically. If other insurers withdraw coverage in these or other states, this may lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our creditor placed homeowners insurance in these areas. Claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Our ability to write new business also could be affected. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophes in the future. Pre tax catastrophe losses in excess of $1 million (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent years are: total losses of approximately $10 million incurred in 2001 in connection with tropical storm Allison; total losses of approximately $12 million incurred in 2002 in connection with Arizona wildfires, Texas floods and Hurricane Lili; and total losses of approximately $30 million incurred in 2003 in connection with various catastrophes caused by windstorms, hailstorms, tornadoes, Hurricane Isabel, and wildfires in southern California. In addition, our group life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care. For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths. Losses due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our successful utilization of catastrophic property and life reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a single event or multiple events, and life and disability reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently widely available. This means that the occurrence of a significant catastrophe could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in Assurant PreNeed the average age of policyholders is in excess of 70 years. This group is more susceptible to epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 88 Table of Contents Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to the terrorist assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance for man made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity constraints and, to the limited extent available, much more expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results. If we fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect our ability to write future business. As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life, property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent. We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of FFG to The Hartford. The assets backing the liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust, and the separate accounts relating to the FFG business are still reflected on our balance sheet. However, we would be responsible for administering this business in the event of a default by the reinsurer. We do not have the administrative systems and capabilities to process this business today. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to increase the value of the separate accounts relating to the business sold if such value declines. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make these payments. We are exposed to the credit risk of our agents in Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant Solutions. We advance agents commissions as part of our pre funded funeral insurance product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage as opposed to a percentage of the first year premium paid, the formula that is more common in other life insurance markets. There is a one year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. There is a very large producer within Assurant PreNeed and if it were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, we have not had any loss experience with this very large producer to date. In addition, we are subject to the credit risk of the parties with which we contract in Assurant Solutions. If these parties fail to remit payments owed to us or pass on payments they collect on our behalf, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, a client with whom we do business has declared bankruptcy. In the event that this client does not honor its claims obligation, we would be liable for making payment, which we estimate to be approximately $37 million, net of offsetting collateral, 89 Table of Contents as of December 31, 2003. We would also be responsible for administering such claims. Probable and estimable loss contingencies associated with this risk have been accrued. A further decline in the manufactured housing market may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant decline in both shipments and retail sales in the last five years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased from approximately 370,000 in 1998 to 130,000 in 2003, representing a 65% decline. Repossessions are at an all time high, resale values have been significantly reduced and several lenders, dealers, manufacturers and vertically integrated manufactured housing companies have either ceased operations or gone bankrupt. This downturn in the industry is the result of several factors, including excess production, aggressive sales practices, reduced underwriting standards and poor lending practices. As a result of this downturn, the industry has experienced consolidation, with the leaders purchasing the weaker competitors. If these downward trends continue, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moodys and seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P and Fitch. The ratings reflect A.M. Bests, Moodys, S&Ps and Fitchs opinions of our subsidiaries financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. The ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings. Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A are Excellent). Our other domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Moodys financial strength rating is A2 (Good) for one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are Good), and A3 (Good) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The S&P financial strength rating is A (Strong) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A are Strong), and A (Strong) for two of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Fitch financial strength rating for the seven rated domestic insurance companies is A (Strong) which is the third highest of twelve rating categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A, and A are Strong). Rating agencies review their ratings periodically and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P or Fitch, or placed under surveillance or review with possible negative implications, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could suffer and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to, among other things: the competitive 90 Table of Contents environment in the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. As customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P or Fitch, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Contracts representing approximately 18% of Assurant Solutions net earned premiums and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2003 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from A or better to B or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts if the subsidiaries ratings fall below these minimum acceptable levels. Under our ten year marketing agreement with SCI, American Memorial Life Insurance Company (AMLIC), one of our subsidiaries in the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. In our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments, we do not have any material contracts that permit termination in the case of a ratings downgrade. Since January 1, 2000, none of the A.M. Best ratings for our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries has been downgraded. On September 25, 2003, the Moodys financial strength rating for Fortis Benefits Insurance Company, one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, was downgraded from A1 (Good) to A2 (Good) and the financial strength rating for John Alden Life Insurance Company, another domestic operating insurance subsidiary, was downgraded from A2 (Good) to A3 (Good) in contemplation of the fact that we would no longer be wholly owned by Fortis. In addition, on May 2, 2003, Moodys downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Fortis Benefits Insurance Company from Aa3 (Excellent) to A1 (Good) corresponding to the downgrading of Fortis. These recent downgrades did not have a quantifiable impact on the business of these subsidiaries primarily because our operating insurance companies rely solely on the ratings of A.M. Best for the marketing and sale of their products. The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is dependent upon our ability to keep up to date with technological advances. This is particularly important in Assurant Solutions, where our systems, including our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients, are critical to the operation of our business. Our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we have spent approximately $90 million in Assurant Solutions, $55 million in Assurant Health, $43 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $4 million in Assurant PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information systems. In 2004, we plan to spend for these purposes approximately $124 million in Assurant Solutions, $73 million in Assurant Health, $53 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed. In addition, our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we do not maintain 91 Table of Contents adequate systems we could experience adverse consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers; customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation exposure; or increases in administrative expenses. Our management information, internal control and financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and development to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements of being a public company. Failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, reduction to our profitability and or subject us to fines and penalties. A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health segment is the subject of national and state legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and certain of the activities conducted by our Assurant Solutions segment are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect such confidential information vary by business segment and may include among other things: training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information; actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information and maintaining a clean desk policy aimed at safeguarding certain current information. In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory problems, loss of reputation and client litigation. See Risks Related to Our Industry Cost of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. While our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new insurance ventures have played a significant role in achieving desired market positions in some, but not all, of our businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including among other things: inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that most of our acquisitions have been successful and 92 Table of Contents have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, we did recognize a goodwill impairment of $1,261 million in 2002 related to an earlier acquisition. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder dividends. As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiarys assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary. The payment of dividends to us by any of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiarys domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for more than half of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the greater of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior years statutory net income. In the remaining states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, the formula is the lesser amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. In addition, as part of the regulatory approval process for the acquisition of ABIG in 1999, we entered into an agreement with the Florida Insurance Department pursuant to which, until August of 2004, two of our subsidiaries have agreed to limit the amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to us to an amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise permitted under Florida law. Likewise, one of our subsidiaries, First Fortis Life Insurance Company, entered into an agreement with the New York Insurance Department as part of the regulatory approval process for the merger of Bankers American Life Assurance Company into First Fortis Life Insurance Company in 2001 pursuant to which it has agreed not to pay any ordinary dividends to us until fiscal year 2004. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States State Regulation Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us in 2003 without regulatory approval was approximately $290 million, of which approximately $99.5 million was paid during 2003. We expect that as a result of, among other things, statutory accounting for our sold businesses, the maximum amount of dividends our subsidiaries will be able to pay to us will be significantly lower in 2004. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses. Our $500 million senior revolving credit facility dated as of January 30, 2004 and our Series B and Series C Preferred Stock also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends. See Item 5 Market for 93 Table of Contents Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matter and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Preferred Stock and Dividend Policy. Risks Related to Our Industry We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be profitable. In each of our lines of business, we compete with other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line and product, although we have no single competitor who competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate. Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities. Competitors include insurance companies and financial institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors include health insurance companies and the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include benefits and life insurance companies as well as not for profit Delta Dental plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two pre need life insurance companies with nationwide representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business. Competition in our businesses is based on many factors, including quality of service, product features, price, scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies. We compete not only for business and individual customers, employer and other group customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without being subject to insurance regulations. Also, as a result of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which was enacted in November 1999, financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our own. This has resulted in new competitors with significant financial resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do, which may lead them to price their products and services lower than we do. In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. For example, several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a substantial market share. In addition, with regard to Assurant Health, organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able to compete effectively in such markets. New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers. 94 Table of Contents The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our results. The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for periods ranging from two to six years. The segments of the insurance markets in which we operate tend not to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality. Periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of underwriting capacity permit more favorable rate levels, consequent fluctuations in underwriting results and the occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these markets. Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the insurer, including competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. This may cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our product prices in order to maintain our market position, because of the adverse effect on profitability of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations of appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other factors affecting the insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results. The nature of the market for the insurance and related products and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting our industries to periodic negative publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. In addition to the occasional employment related litigation to which all businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to, our insurance and other related business operations. We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to: disputes over coverage or claims adjudication; disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements; disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims; disputes concerning past premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race; disputes relating to customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various business segments; disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions; disputes relating to certain excess of loss programs in the London market; disputes with taxing authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us. 95 Table of Contents In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies. Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses. There are various governmental and administrative investigations and proceedings pending against us. For example, an indictment has been issued in Minnesota alleging that one of our subsidiaries and two corporate officers of Assurant Solutions each violated the Minnesota Fair Campaign Practices Act. The outcome of these investigations and proceedings cannot be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such investigations or proceedings or any litigation would not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; authorizing lines of business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating underwriting limitations; imposing dividend limitations; regulating changes in control; licensing agents and distributors of insurance products; placing limitations on the minimum and maximum size of life insurance contracts; restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets; admitting statutory assets; mandating certain insurance benefits; restricting companies ability to terminate or cancel coverage; requiring companies to provide certain types of coverage; regulating premium rates, including the ability to increase premium rates; approving policy forms; regulating trade and claims practices; imposing privacy requirements; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; restricting certain transactions between affiliates; regulating the content of disclosures to debtors in the credit insurance area; regulating the type, amounts and valuation of investments; mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds; regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents; and 96 Table of Contents restricting contact with consumers, such as the recently created national do not call list, and imposing consumer protection measures. Assurant Health is also required by some jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by insurers. Each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to some risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of individuals. HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning July 1, 1997. See also Risks Related to Our Industry Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The capacity for an insurance companys growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices and procedures, is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies. We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. That type of action could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions; limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impositions of fines, taxes or other penalties for improper licensing, the failure to promptly pay claims, however defined, or other regulatory violations; increased licensing requirements; 97 Table of Contents prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations; new benefit mandates; increased regulation relating to the use of associations and trusts in the sale of individual health insurance; limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and, as a result, manage health care and utilization due to any willing provider legislation, which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement; limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider; and restriction of solicitation of pre funded funeral insurance consumers by funeral board laws. State legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory projects, all of which can affect our operations. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, could significantly harm the insurance industry and us. Federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. In addition, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care issues. The U.S. Congress is considering Patients Bill of Rights legislation, which, if adopted, would permit health plans to be sued in state court for coverage determinations and could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). There recently have been legislative attempts to limit ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. For example, the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would, among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures, require plans to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a national health insurance program. Any of these proposals, if implemented, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Federal changes in Medicare and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have negative implications for the private sector due to cost shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers. State small employer group and individual health insurance market reforms to increase access and affordability could also reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing for risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance policies. In addition, the U.S. Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to 98 Table of Contents allow an optional federal incorporation, similar to banks. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the federal government has granted charters in years past to insurance like organizations that are not subject to state insurance regulations, such as risk retention groups. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States Federal Regulation Legislative Developments. Thus, it is hard to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or on us. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. In addition, the insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The privacy of individuals has been the subject of recent state and federal legislation. State privacy laws, particularly those with opt in clauses, can affect the pre funded funeral insurance business. These laws make it harder to share information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created do not call list would restrict our ability to contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our expectations for growth in our direct marketed consumer credit insurance products in the United States. HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have thus far been adopted impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. We have been working diligently to comply with these regulations in the time periods required. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of the required transactions or that other entities with which we interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims. HIPAA is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Known and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties. In addition, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of the insurance policy and annually thereafter. Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements. However, certain state laws may require individuals to opt in to information sharing instead of being immediately included. This could significantly increase costs of doing business. Additionally, when final U.S. Treasury Department regulations are promulgated in connection with the USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to expend additional resources to tailor our existing anti fraud efforts to the new rules. Risks Related to Our Relationship with and Separation from Fortis Fortis will continue to have representation on our board of directors and influence our affairs for as long as it remains a significant stockholder. 99 Table of Contents As of February 5, 2004, Fortis, through Fortis Insurance N.V., its wholly owned subsidiary, owned approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. For as long as Fortis continues to own shares of common stock representing more than one third of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, it will be able to veto corporate actions requiring a two thirds vote of our stockholders. Fortis may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. We have entered into a shareholders agreement with Fortis pursuant to which Fortis has the right to nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, two designees (out of a maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our board of directors. In addition, although Fortis has advised us that it intends to divest all of its shares of our common stock over a period of time, Fortis is under no obligation to do so. Subject to the terms of the lock up agreement described below, Fortis has the sole discretion to determine the timing of any such divestiture. See Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for additional information on lock up agreements and related party transactions between our Company and Fortis. In addition, for so long as Fortis continues to own less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, the following will also apply: Our board of directors shall consist of no more than 12 directors (including at least seven independent directors); Fortis will have the right to nominate two designees to our board of directors (out of a maximum of 12 directors), and the shareholders agreement and our by laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees; and Pursuant to the shareholders agreement, the following significant corporate actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis Insurance, as shareholder: any recapitalization, reclassification, spin off or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries; or any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceedings with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries. Because Fortis will control us, conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could arise which may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us, including, but not limited to, the following areas: Stock Ownership. So long as Fortis owns shares of common stock representing more than one third of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, Fortis will be able to veto mergers and the sale of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets. With certain limited exceptions, Fortis, exercising its rights as a stockholder, can veto a merger or sale without regard to the interests of the other stockholders. In addition, the shareholders agreement also provides that for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, the following actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis Insurance N.V., as stockholder: any recapitalization, reclassification or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries (other than certain activities between wholly owned subsidiaries); and 100 Table of Contents any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to us or our principal subsidiaries. For more information regarding the shareholders agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Shareholders Agreement. Cross Directorships. Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are directors of our Company who are also currently directors and or officers of Fortis. Service as both a director of our Company and as a director or officer of Fortis or ownership interests of directors or officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. Our directors who are also directors or officers of Fortis will have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For example, these decisions could relate to: disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition or disposition opportunity; or corporate finance decisions. Allocation of Business Opportunities. Although we do not expect Fortis to compete with us in the near term, there may be business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis and us. Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to Fortis and we may have no recourse against the Fortis designees or Fortis. We have no formal mechanisms for allocating business opportunities. The loss of the Fortis name in Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant PreNeed may affect our profitability. In connection with our separation from Fortis, we have changed our name and the names of our business units to Assurant, Inc. and other Assurant names and have launched a re branding initiative pursuant to which we will change our brand name and most of the trademarks and trade names under which we conduct our business. The transition to our new name in each of our business segments and subsidiaries will occur rapidly in the case of some products and business segments and over specified periods in the case of other products and business segments. Under the terms of a license from Fortis, we have only a limited amount of time to continue to use the Fortis name. Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant PreNeed have expended substantial resources to establish the Fortis name and reputation in the health, employee benefits and pre funded funeral insurance marketplace, particularly among brokers and consultants acting as advisors in the health and benefits market and with funeral directors in the pre funded funeral market. The impact of the change in trademarks and trade names and other changes (including, without limitation, the name change) on our business and operations cannot be fully predicted, and the lack of an established brand image for the Assurant name in the health, benefits and pre funded funeral insurance marketplace may cause a disruption in sales and persistency and thus affect profitability. Any such disruption could also cause rating agencies to lower our financial strength and other ratings in the future. In addition, the costs of effecting the name change and branding initiative will be substantial and are currently estimated to be approximately $10 million. In certain states we may be required to notify policyholders of our name change and in certain instances new certificates may need to be issued. This might result in increased lapses of our insurance policies. Because Fortis operates U.S. branch offices, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA). Fortis Bank SA/NV (Fortis Bank), which is a subsidiary of Fortis, obtained approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the Federal Reserve Board to establish branch offices in Connecticut and New York. By virtue of the opening of these offices, the U.S. operations of Fortis, including our operations, became subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the BHCA. In order to continue to operate its U.S. nonbanking operations, including the insurance activities conducted by our subsidiaries, Fortis notified the Federal Reserve Board of its election to be a financial holding company for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal Reserve Boards implementing regulations in Regulation Y. Pursuant to Fortis status as a financial 101 Table of Contents holding company, Fortis and its subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries, are permitted to engage in nonbanking activities in the United States that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity as defined in Section 4(k) of the BHCA and in Regulation Y. In particular, Fortis status as a financial holding company permits Fortis to engage in the United States in both banking activities through the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank and insurance activities through our subsidiaries. Activities that are financial in nature include, among other things: insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or providing and issuing annuities; and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing. Fortis will continue to qualify as a financial holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains well capitalized and well managed as those terms are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be considered well capitalized if it maintains tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively, and will be considered well managed if it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. As a general matter, as long as Fortis controls us within the meaning of the BHCA or owns more than 5% of any class of our voting shares, the BHCA does not permit us to engage in nonfinancial activities such as manufacturing, distribution of goods and real estate development except to the extent that another exemption under the BHCA, such as the merchant banking exemption, is available. If the Federal Reserve Board were to determine that any of our existing activities were not insurance activities or not otherwise financial in nature or not incidental to such activities, or if Fortis lost and was unable to regain its financial holding company status, we could be required to restructure our operations or divest some of these operations, which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability. The Federal Reserve Board oversees all of Fortis direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries for compliance with the BHCA, including our Company. Our Company will be considered a subsidiary of Fortis so long as Fortis owns 25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise controls us within the meaning of the BHCA. In addition, even if we are not a subsidiary of Fortis, the nonfinancial activities restrictions of the BHCA and Regulation Y (discussed above) would continue to apply so long as Fortis owned more than 5% of any class of our voting shares and another BHCA exemption, such as the merchant banking exemption, is not available. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate the entrenchment of directors, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. The following provisions included in our certificate of incorporation and by laws have anti takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by laws: permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; divide our board of directors into three classes; limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; 102 Table of Contents except for Fortis, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors; prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent; impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; subject to limited exceptions, require the approval of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter to approve mergers and consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and require the approval by the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter for the stockholders to amend the provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation described in the second through seventh bullet points above and this supermajority provision. In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to affect a change of control of our Company. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person acquiring 5% or more of shares of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the applicants plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. From time to time, the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in operating results; natural disasters and terrorist attacks; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; press releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our markets; regulatory changes; sales of stock by insiders; and changes in our financial strength ratings. 103 Table of Contents In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility that the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. As of December 31, 2003, we held $8,729 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $933 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 88% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2002, we held $8,036 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $842 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 88% of total invested assets. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. 104 Table of Contents The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying yield curves. We have assumed that both the United States and Canadian yield curves have a 100% correlation and, therefore, move together. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2003 100 50 0 50 100 (In millions) Total market value $ 9,255 $ 8,989 $ 8,729 $ 8,472 $ 8,224 % Change in market value from base case 6.0 % 3.0 % 0.00 % (2.9 )% (5.8 )% $ Change in market value from base case $ 526 $ 260 $ 0 $ (257 ) $ (505 ) Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. See Item 1 Business Investments. The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2003: Percentage Rating Fair Value of Total (In millions) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,074 70% Baa 2,110 24% Ba 361 4% B and lower 184 2% Total $ 8,729 100% We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $4,445 million of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2003, we are protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,537 million and $873 million as of December 31, 2003 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of 105 Table of Contents the assets in these trusts decreases, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 16% of Assurant PreNeeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $391 million as of December 31, 2003 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing a contract with payments tied to the Consumer Price Index. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily British pounds and Danish krone. Total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 1% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2003. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. We assess our foreign exchange risk by examining the foreign exchange rate exposure of the excess of invested assets over the statutory reserve liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Two stress scenarios are examined. The first scenario assumes a hypothetical 10% immediate change in the foreign exchange rate. The second scenario assumes a more severe 2.33 standard deviation event (comparable to a one in 100 probability under a normal distribution). The modeling techniques we use to calculate our exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates or correlation among various markets. Our actual experience may differ due to correlation assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology, such as significant illiquidity or other market events. Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. 106 Table of Contents On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract to partially hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our pre funded funeral insurance policies. See Inflation risk. In 2003, we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we transferred the invested assets related to this coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments in the December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance products and related services in North America and selected other markets. We provide: creditor placed homeowners insurance; manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended service contracts; individual health and small employer group health insurance; group dental insurance; group disability insurance; group life insurance and pre funded funeral insurance. The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive profit opportunities. 46 Table of Contents We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results of operations of FFG from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. As such, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Revenues We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Our investment portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads. Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death benefit growth rates on pre funded funeral insurance policies and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Expenses Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 18 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through 47 Table of Contents product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in December 2003 and January 2004, we redeemed all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to their aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and aggregate premium of approximately $206 million, all of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge credit facilities described under Liquidity and Capital Resources in connection with these redemptions. Regulation Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For other factors affecting our results of operations or financial condition, see Risk Factors. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following transactions: On October 10, 2002, we sold the Peer Review and Analysis division (PRA) of CORE, Inc. (CORE) to MCMC, LLC, an independent provider of medical analysis services. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of PRA. On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership in Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP) to NHP Holding LLC. We recorded pre tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. On December 31, 2001, we acquired Protective Life Corporations Dental Benefits Division (DBD), including the acquisition through reinsurance of Protectives indemnity dental, life and disability business and its prepaid dental subsidiaries. Total revenues of $305 million and income after tax of $15 million were generated by the DBD operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. DBD is included in Assurant Employee Benefits. On July 12, 2001, we acquired CORE, a national provider of employee absence management services. Total revenues of $31 million and income after tax of $0.2 million were generated by the CORE operations from July 12, 2001 through December 31, 2001, as compared to total revenues of $66 million and income after tax of $3 million in 2002. CORE is included in Assurant Employee Benefits. On April 2, 2001, we sold our FFG business to The Hartford primarily through a reinsurance arrangement. Total revenues of $146 million and income after tax of $8 million were generated by the FFG operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to total revenues of $669 million and income after tax of $65 million during 2000. FFG included certain individual life insurance policies, investment type annuity contracts and mutual fund operations. The sale of the mutual fund operations 48 Table of Contents resulted in $62 million of pre tax gains. The sale via reinsurance of the individual life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts resulted in $558 million of pre tax gains, which were deferred upon closing and are being amortized over the remaining life of the contracts. All activities related to FFG are included in the Corporate and Other segment. See Critical Accounting Policies. Prior to April 2, 2001, FFG had issued variable insurance products that are required to be registered as securities under the Securities Act. Variable insurance refers to an investment oriented life insurance policy that offers fixed premiums and a minimum death benefit as well as providing a return linked to an underlying portfolio of securities. These registered insurance contracts, which we no longer sell, have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford through modified coinsurance agreements. The Hartford administers this closed block of business pursuant to a third party administration agreement. Since this block of business was sold through modified coinsurance agreements, separate account assets and separate account liabilities associated with these products continue to be reflected in our financial statements. See the line items entitled Assets held in separate accounts and Liabilities related to separate accounts in our consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities created by these variable insurance policies are tied to the performance of underlying investments held in separate accounts of the insurance company that originally issued such policies. While we own the separate account assets, the laws governing separate accounts provide that the income, gains and losses from assets in the separate account are credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income, gains or losses of the insurer. Further, the laws provide that the separate account will not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer may conduct. The result of this structure is that the assets held in the separate account correspond to and are equal to the liabilities created by the variable insurance contracts. At December 31, 2003, we had separate account assets and liabilities of $3,805 million compared to $4,809 million on April 2, 2001, the date of the FFG sale. Comparing our results from period to period requires taking into account these acquisitions and dispositions. For a more detailed description of these acquisitions and dispositions, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Policies There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Premiums Short Duration Contracts Our short duration contracts are those on which we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term. Our short duration contracts primarily include: group term life, group disability medical and dental, property and warranty, credit life and disability, extended service contracts and individual medical issued after 2002 in most jurisdictions. Long Duration Contracts Currently, our long duration contracts being sold are pre funded funeral life insurance and investment type annuities. For pre funded funeral life insurance policies, any excess of the gross premium over the net premium is deferred and is recognized in income in a constant relationship with the insurance in force. For 49 Table of Contents pre funded funeral investment type annuity contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and traditional life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from policyholders. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively. Reinsurance Assumed Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates which are based on both payments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Fee Income We primarily derive income from fees received from providing administration services. Fee income is earned when services are performed. Reserves Reserves are established according to generally accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. 50 Table of Contents Short Duration Contracts For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. For group disability and group life, the case reserves and IBNR are recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the expected future claims payments. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. In July 2003, the valuation interest rate was lowered to 5.25% from 6% for group long term disability and raised to 5.25% from 3.5% for group term life waiver of premium reserves. Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the unexpired period of the policy. We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for IBNR of $37 million (before reinsurance) and $36 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at December 31, 2003. Any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos, environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $2.9 million, $1.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. One of our subsidiaries, (ARIC), participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased writing such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. We believe, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate. The inherent uncertainty 51 Table of Contents of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. Long Duration Contracts Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 or issued in the state of Minnesota and the traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of the future net premiums. These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral investment type annuities, universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, and the variable life insurance and investment type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded for these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. A premium deficiency is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations as a reduction of DAC to the extent that future policy premiums, including anticipation of interest income, are not adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Short Duration Contracts DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical issued in most jurisdictions after 2002, small group medical, group term life and group disability consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers, which are level, and compensation to representatives, which is spread out and is not front end loaded. These costs do not vary with the production of new business. As a result, these costs are not deferred but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. 52 Table of Contents Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed businesses were written off when the businesses were sold. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Changes in individual security values are monitored on a semi monthly basis in order to identify potential problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost. Each month the watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. Each quarter any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our 53 Table of Contents insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. Other Accounting Policies For a description of other accounting policies applicable to the periods covered by this report, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. New Accounting Standard On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Upon adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In addition, we were required to subject our goodwill to an initial impairment test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to conduct impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment event, our net income will be higher as a result of not having to amortize goodwill. As a result of this initial impairment test, we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,261 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. We also performed a January 1, 2003 impairment test during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and concluded that goodwill was not further impaired. See New Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of additional new accounting standards that are applicable to us. 54 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 6,157 $ 5,681 $ 5,242 Net investment income 607 632 712 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 2 (118 ) (119 ) Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses 68 80 68 Gain on disposal of businesses 11 62 Fees and other income 232 246 222 Total revenues 7,066 6,532 6,187 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (3,657 ) (3,435 ) (3,240 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses(1) (2,829 ) (2,609 ) (2,496 ) Amortization of goodwill (113 ) Interest expense (1 ) (14 ) Distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (113 ) (118 ) (118 ) Interest premiums on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (6,806 ) (6,162 ) (5,981 ) Income before income taxes 260 370 206 Income taxes (74 ) (110 ) (108 ) Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 186 260 98 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1,261 ) Net income (loss) $ 186 $ (1,001 ) $ 98 (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. Note: The table above includes amortization of goodwill in 2001 and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002. These items are only included in this Consolidated Overview. As a result, the tables presented under the segment discussions do not total to the same amounts shown on this consolidated overview table. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $534 million, or 8%, from $6,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 55 Table of Contents net earned premiums and other considerations is primarily due to increases of $285 million, $175 million, and $23 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $9 million in Assurant PreNeed. The increase in Assurant Solutions is due to growth in specialty property and consumer protection products. The increase in Assurant Health is primarily due to increases in individual health insurance business due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net investment income decreased by $25 million, or 4%, from $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment yields driven by the lower interest rate environment. The yield on average invested assets was 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada, and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million in the Corporate and Other segment. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no disposals in 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pretax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 6%, from $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002, associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $222 million, or 6%, from $3,435 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $3,657 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $144 million, $95 million, and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty property products, primarily creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health insurance business, which is consistent with growth in this business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,829 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $141 million, $43 million, and $11 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was consistent with growth in the specialty property and consumer protection products business. The increase in Assurant Health 56 Table of Contents was primarily due to increases in commissions, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general expenses, which was consistent with the growth in business. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in early January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million in interest premiums on redemption of subsidiary trusts for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in 2002. Net Income Net income increased by $1,187 million, or 119%, from a loss of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to a profit of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2003. Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or 33%, from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.6% compared to 29.7% in 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $345 million, or 6%, from $6,187 million in 2001 to $6,532 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $439 million, or 8%, from $5,242 million in 2001 to $5,681 million in 2002. Excluding the effect of the various acquisitions and dispositions described above, net earned premiums and other considerations increased mainly due to strong growth in Assurant Solutions primarily as a result of growth in new business and in Assurant PreNeed primarily due to an increase in the average size of policies sold by the AMLIC division. Net investment income decreased by $80 million, or 11%, from $712 million in 2001 to $632 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in achieved investment yields, driven by the lower interest rate environment and a decrease in average invested assets of $290 million. The yield on average invested assets was 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 6.83% for the year ended December 31, 2001. This reflected lower yields on fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages. Net realized losses on investments decreased by $1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to $118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other than temporary impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001 consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in Enron Corp. (Enron). Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from $68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a full year of amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of FFG as compared to nine months of amortization in 2001. This deferred gain on sale is discussed in more detail under Corporate and Other below. 57 Table of Contents Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to $11 million in 2002. The $62 million reflects the gain on the sale of FFGs mutual fund operations. The $11 million reflected the pre tax gain on the sale of NHP. Fees and other income increased by $24 million, or 11%, from $222 million in 2001 to $246 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a full year of fee income from CORE and an increase in fee income from Assurant Solutions, mainly from their credit insurance business transitioning to debt protection administration. In late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions credit insurance clients began a transition from use of our credit insurance products to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income rather than net earned premiums and where margins are lower than in the traditional credit insurance programs. However, because debt protection administration is not an insurance product, certain costs such as regulatory costs and cost of capital are expected to be eliminated as the transition from credit insurance to debt protection administration services continues. The fees from debt protection administration did not fully compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums The increases were partially offset by a $42 million, or 63%, decrease from the Corporate and Other segment due to the sale of FFG (partially through reinsurance), which had $65 million of fee income (generated from mutual fund operations included in such sale) in the first quarter of 2001. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $181 million, or 3%, from $5,981 million in 2001 to $6,162 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $195 million, or 6%, from $3,240 million in 2001 to $3,435 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the effects of the acquisitions and dispositions described above. The increases were also partially offset by an $84 million, or 6%, decrease from Assurant Health, primarily due to a higher mix of individual health insurance business, which generally has a lower expected loss ratio relative to small employer group business, disciplined pricing and product design changes. (Loss premiums and other considerations include the amount of net premiums allocable to the expired period of an insurance policy or policies, including fees earned on interest sensitive policies). Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $113 million, or 5%, from $2,496 million in 2001 to $2,609 million in 2002. Assurant Employee Benefits contributed $106 million of this increase, primarily due to the DBD and CORE acquisitions. This increase was offset by a $65 million decrease in the Corporate and Other segment due to the sale of FFG. Selling, underwriting and general expenses in Assurant Health increased by $50 million, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of DAC and due to costs associated with higher employee compensation and investments in technology. Also, selling, underwriting and general expenses in Assurant PreNeed increased by $17 million, primarily due to an increase in amortization of DAC and VOBA as a result of an increase in sales of single pay policies and increases in general expenses. Amortization of goodwill was zero in 2002 compared to $113 million in 2001, as a result of our adoption of FAS 142 as described above. Interest expense decreased from $14 million in 2001 to $0 in 2002. In April 2001, we used a portion of the FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of outstanding debt owed to Fortis Finance N.V. (Fortis Finance), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortis. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at $118 million. Net Income Net income decreased by $1,099 million from a profit of $98 million in 2001 to a loss of $1,001 million in 2002. 58 Table of Contents Income taxes increased by $2 million, or 2%, from $108 million in 2001 to $110 million in 2002. The effective tax rate for 2002 was 29.7% compared to 52.4% in 2001. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the elimination of amortization of goodwill in 2002. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect (expense) of change in accounting principle of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2001. Assurant Solutions Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,362 $ 2,077 $ 1,906 Net investment income 187 205 218 Fees and other income 129 119 98 Total revenues 2,678 2,401 2,222 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (899 ) (755 ) (640 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (1,590 ) (1,449 ) (1,444 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,489 ) (2,204 ) (2,084 ) Segment income before income tax 189 197 138 Income taxes (56 ) (65 ) (40 ) Segment income after tax $ 133 $ 132 $ 98 Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Specialty Property Solutions(1) $ 733 $ 552 $ 452 Consumer Protection Solutions(2) 1,629 1,525 1,454 Total $ 2,362 $ 2,077 $ 1,906 (1) Specialty Property Solutions includes a variety of specialized property insurance programs that are coupled with differentiated administrative capabilities. (2) Consumer Protection Solutions includes an array of debt protection administration services, credit insurance programs and warranties and extended service contracts. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $277 million, or 12%, from $2,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $285 million, or 14%, from $2,077 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $180 million of additional net earned premiums and other considerations attributable to our special property products, which includes approximately $133 million from our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners insurance lines of business generated from new clients and increased sales growth from our existing clients. Consumer protection products also 59 Table of Contents contributed $105 million in net earned premiums and other considerations primarily from growth in our warranty and extended service contracts business. Net investment income decreased by $18 million, or 9%, from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The average portfolio yield dropped 62 basis points from 5.85% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.23% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 2%. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 8%, from $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the continuing transition of our credit insurance business to our debt protection administration business. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $144 million, or 19%, from $755 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our specialty property products accounted for $112 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business and approximately $18 million of the increase is attributable to various catastrophes ($30 million in 2003 compared to $12 million in 2002). Our consumer protection products also contributed $32 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our warranty and extended service contracts line of business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling and underwriting expenses increased by $116 million, which consisted of $45 million primarily from our specialty property products due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of the increase was from our consumer protection products due to increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract lines of business. General expenses increased by $25 million, primarily from start up costs related to setting up new clients in the creditor placed homeowners insurance area and increased business from our warranty and extended service contract products. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $1 million, or 1%, from $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the decrease in investment income of $13 million after tax, segment income after tax increased by $14 million, or 11%. Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or 14%, from $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 8%, from $2,222 million in 2001 to $2,401 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $171 million, or 9%, from $1,906 million in 2001 to $2,077 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to approximately $100 million of additional net earned premiums from our specialty property solutions products, including approximately $86 million from the growth of our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance, flood insurance and manufactured housing related property coverages. Consumer protection solutions contributed an additional $71 million to the increase in net earned premiums primarily due to the growth of $39 million attributable to our warranty and extended service contracts business and $58 million from an accidental death and dismemberment product, 60 Table of Contents which we started selling in 2001 and stopped selling in 2002. These increases were partly offset by the decrease in credit insurance products as the transition from credit insurance products to debt protection administration programs continued and fees from debt protection administration programs did not fully compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums. See Item 1 Business Operating Business Segments Assurant Solutions Consumer Protection Solutions. Net investment income decreased by $13 million, or 6%, from $218 million in 2001 to $205 million in 2002. The average portfolio yield dropped 51 basis points from 6.36% in 2001 to 5.85% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment. This decrease was partially offset by the reinvestment of tax advantaged investments, such as preferred stock, low income housing tax credit investments and tax exempt municipal bonds, into higher yield taxable investments. Also, average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 2%. Fees and other income increased by $21 million, or 21%, from $98 million in 2001 to $119 million in 2002, including $13 million in additional fee income resulting from our credit insurance business transitioning to debt protection administration services. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $120 million, or 6%, from $2,084 million in 2001 to $2,204 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $115 million, or 18%, from $640 million in 2001 to $755 million in 2002. Consumer protection solutions benefits contributed $98 million of this increase due primarily to $36 million from the warranty and extended service contracts business and $24 million from an accidental death and disability product. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in benefits in credit insurance products, which related to the decrease in premiums resulting from the transition to debt protection administration products. The growth of our specialty property solutions product lines also contributed a further $17 million to the increase in policyholder benefits in 2002, including approximately $11 million of losses related to Hurricane Lili and Arizona wildfires. In 2001, we had approximately $10 million in losses related to tropical storm Allison. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $5 million, or less than 1%, from $1,444 million in 2001 to $1,449 million in 2002. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees contributed $21 million to the increase. The increase was primarily in our specialty property solutions business from the growth in the creditor placed homeowners and manufactured housing homeowners insurance products. This increase was offset by a decrease in general expenses of $16 million primarily due to a non recurring cost incurred in 2001. Segment Income After Tax As a result of the foregoing, segment income after tax increased by $34 million, or 35%, from $98 million in 2001 to $132 million in 2002. Income taxes increased $25 million, or 62%, from $40 million in 2001 to $65 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a 43% increase in segment income before income tax. The majority of the remaining increase was due to an increase in our effective tax rate primarily due to our decision to reduce our ownership of tax advantaged investments. 61 Table of Contents Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions except membership data) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,009 $ 1,834 $ 1,838 Net investment income 49 55 58 Fees and other income 33 23 14 Total revenues 2,091 1,912 1,910 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (1,317 ) (1,222 ) (1,306 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (589 ) (546 ) (496 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,906 ) (1,768 ) (1,802 ) Segment income before income tax 185 144 108 Income taxes (64 ) (49 ) (37 ) Segment income after tax $ 121 $ 95 $ 71 Loss ratio(1) 65.6 % 66.6 % 71.1 % Expense ratio(2) 28.9 % 29.4 % 26.8 % Combined ratio(3) 93.3 % 95.2 % 97.3 % Membership by product line (in thousands): Individual 761 670 600 Small employer group 376 355 420 Total 1,137 1,025 1,020 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 9.0%, from $1,912 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $175 million, or 10%, from $1,834 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,009 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance business increased $156 million due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance business increased $19 million primarily because we instituted premium rate increases in select small group markets to sufficiently price for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for anticipated future medical trends. 62 Table of Contents Net investment income decreased by $6 million, or 11%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 69 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 6.43% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.74% for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the lower interest rate environment. Offsetting the decrease in yield was a 5% increase in average invested assets for the year ended December 31, 2003, over the comparable prior year period. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 43%, from $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets, such as sales of our non insurance health access discount cards. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $138 million, or 8%, from $1,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,906 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $95 million, or 8%, from $1,222 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was consistent with the increase in net earned premiums and other considerations. The loss ratio improved 100 basis points from 66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to our risk management activities. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $43 million, or 8%, from $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Commissions increased by $33 million corresponding to an increase in first year net earned premiums over the prior year. Taxes, licenses and fees decreased by $6 million due to reduced premium tax rates on a portion of the medical premium. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $7 million due to higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General expenses increased by $9 million mainly due to additional spending to improve claims experience. The expense ratio improved 50 basis points from 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $26 million, or 27%, from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income taxes increased by $15 million, or 31%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 28% increase in segment income before income tax during the year ended December 31, 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues remained virtually unchanged from 2001 to 2002, at $1,910 million in 2001 as compared to $1,912 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations also remained stable from 2001 to 2002, at $1,838 million in 2001 as compared to $1,834 million in 2002, with an increase of $142 million in 2002 in the net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance products being offset by a decrease of $146 million during such year in net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance products. Net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance business increased due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance business decreased due to declining membership, partially offset by small employer group premium rate increases that we instituted in selected markets to adequately price for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for anticipated future medical trends. 63 Table of Contents Net investment income decreased by $3 million, or 5%, from $58 million in 2001 to $55 million in 2002. There was a 96 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.39% in 2001 to 6.43% in 2002 mainly due to the lower interest rate environment. Partially offset by the decrease in yield was a 7.7% increase in average allocated invested assets in 2002. Fees and other income increased by $9 million, or 64%, from $14 million in 2001 to $23 million in 2002 due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in our individual health insurance business. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $34 million, or 2%, from $1,802 million in 2001 to $1,768 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits decreased by $84 million, or 6%, from $1,306 million in 2001 to $1,222 million in 2002. This decrease was principally due to a higher mix of individual health insurance business which had a lower loss ratio relative to small employer group health insurance business, primarily due to disciplined pricing and product design changes. The loss ratio improved 450 basis points from 71.1% in 2001 to 66.6% in 2002 due primarily to the higher mix of individual health insurance business, increased premium rates and product design changes. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $50 million, or 10%, from $496 million in 2001 to $546 million in 2002. Taxes, licenses and fees increased by $5 million in 2002, or 13%, due to a change in the mix of business by state and legal entity, and the loss of favorable consolidated premium tax return benefits triggered by the disposition of FFG. The amortization of DAC increased by $21 million in 2002, or 49%, due to higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General expenses increased by $34 million in 2002, or 13%, due to investments in technology, higher employee compensation and additional spending to achieve loss ratio improvements. Partially offsetting these increases was a $10 million, or 7%, decrease in commissions due to a higher mix of first year individual health insurance business. Individual health insurance policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized in subsequent years. The expense ratio increased by 260 basis points from 26.8% in 2001 to 29.4% in 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher commissions on the mix of business in individual health insurance, investments in technology, higher employee compensation and additional spending to achieve loss ratio improvements. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $24 million, or 34%, from $71 million in 2001 to $95 million in 2002. Income taxes increased by $12 million, or 32%, from $37 million in 2001 to $49 million in 2002. The increase was consistent with the 33% increase in segment income before income tax in 2002. 64 Table of Contents Assurant Employee Benefits Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee Benefits segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002(4) 2001(4) (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,256 $ 1,233 $ 934 Net investment income 140 148 144 Fees and other income 54 74 39 Total revenues 1,450 1,455 1,117 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (921 ) (945 ) (738 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (433 ) (422 ) (316 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,354 ) (1,367 ) (1,054 ) Segment income before income tax 96 88 63 Income taxes (34 ) (31 ) (22 ) Segment income after tax $ 62 $ 57 $ 41 Loss ratio(1) 73.3 % 76.6 % 79.0 % Expense ratio(2) 33.1 % 32.3 % 32.5 % Premium persistency ratio(3) 79.9 % 79.9 % 84.3 % Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Group dental $ 539 $ 554 $ 257 Group disability 461 400 398 Group life 256 279 279 Total $ 1,256 $ 1,233 $ 934 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations. (2) The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income. (3) The premium persistency ratio is equal to the rate at which existing business for all issue years at the beginning of the period remains in force at the end of the period. The calculations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 exclude DBD. (4) We acquired DBD on December 31, 2001 and CORE on July 12, 2001; therefore, the results of DBD and CORE are included in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment financial results beginning in 2002 and July 2001, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less than 1%, from $1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 65 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $61 million of additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS. Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition, dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven by lower sales and the non renewal of a large account. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003, which was unchanged from 2002. Net investment income decreased by $8 million, or 5%, from $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 65 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.04% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. Average invested assets increased by 8% from 2002 to 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $20 million, or 27%, from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee revenue from CORE due to the sale of PRA. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by $13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits decreased by $24 million, or 3%, from $945 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was driven by favorable development in disability claims and lower claim volume due to the reduction in dental and group life net earned premiums. In addition, during the third quarter of 2003, we completed reserve studies for the group disability, group life, and group dental products, which concluded that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant. Adjustments were made to reserves to reflect current mortality and morbidity experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million. The benefits loss ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in 2003. Excluding the reserve release discussed above, the benefits loss ratio would have been 74.7% in 2003. This improvement was driven primarily by favorable disability experience. Selling, underwriting, and general expenses increased by $11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio increased from 32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to a $6.2 million write down of previously capitalized software related to our new administration system. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $5 million, or 9%, from $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income tax expense increased by $3 million, or 10%, from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 9% increase in segment income before tax. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $338 million, or 30%, from $1,117 million in 2001 to $1,455 million in 2002, substantially all of which was attributable to the acquisition of DBD. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $299 million, or 32%, from $934 million in 2001 to $1,233 million in 2002. Excluding the $299 million increase in net earned premiums due to the 66 Table of Contents acquisition of DBD, net earned premiums were unchanged at $934 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily because new business was offset by non renewal of certain unprofitable business. An additional contributing factor was increased pressure on ancillary employee benefits provided by employer groups due to increased medical costs. Premium persistency (excluding the DBD acquisition) decreased by 440 basis points from 84.3% for 2001 to 79.9% for 2002 because of disciplined underwriting and reduced employment in renewed groups. Net investment income increased by $4 million from $144 million in 2001 to $148 million in 2002 mainly due to the DBD acquisition. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in investment yields by 36 basis points from 7.52% in 2001 to 7.16% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment. Fees and other income increased by $35 million, or 90%, from $39 million in 2001 to $74 million in 2002 primarily due to a full year of fee revenue from CORE, which was acquired on July 12, 2001. CORE fee revenue was $66 million in 2002, as compared to the half year of revenue recorded in 2001 of $31 million. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $313 million, or 30%, from $1,054 million in 2001 to $1,367 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $207 million, or 28%, from $738 million in 2001 to $945 million in 2002. Excluding the $197 million increase related to the acquisition of DBD, policyholder benefits increased by $10 million, or 1%, driven by growth in group dental premiums. Our loss ratio improved 240 basis points from 79.0% in 2001 to 76.6% in 2002. Excluding the effect of the DBD acquisition, the loss ratio in 2002 was 80.1%, which was higher than in 2001 due to slight deterioration in group dental and group life experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $106 million, or 34%, from $316 million in 2001 to $422 million in 2002 primarily due to the DBD and CORE acquisitions. The expense ratio was virtually unchanged between 2001 and 2002. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $16 million, or 39%, from $41 million in 2001 to $57 million in 2002. Income taxes increased by $9 million, or 41%, from $22 million in 2001 to $31 million in 2002. The increase was consistent with the 40% increase in segment income before income tax. 67 Table of Contents Assurant PreNeed Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant PreNeeds segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 529 $ 538 $ 507 Net investment income 188 184 179 Fees and other income 5 5 3 Total revenues 722 727 689 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (521 ) (513 ) (486 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (146 ) (137 ) (120 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (667 ) (650 ) (606 ) Segment income before income tax 55 77 83 Income taxes (19 ) (27 ) (29 ) Segment income after tax $ 36 $ 50 $ 54 Net earned premiums and other considerations by channel: AMLIC $ 283 $ 293 $ 278 Independent 246 245 229 Total $ 529 $ 538 $ 507 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, or 1%, from $727 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $722 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $9 million, or 2%, from $538 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $529 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel which was caused by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI, AMLICs principal customer. Net investment income increased by $4 million, or 2%, from $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. A 8% increase in average invested assets was offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the annualized investment yield, which was 6.91% at December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at December 31, 2003. The increase in average invested assets was due to a larger inforce block of business. The rate decline reduced net investment income by $10 million over the comparable prior year period. The decline in yields was due to the lower interest rate environment and the restructuring of the portfolio in 2002 to improve credit quality. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $17 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 68 Table of Contents Policyholder benefits increased by $8 million, or 2%, from $513 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase is due to the increase in business written and other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies use a Consumer Price Index rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition, benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $9 million, or 7%, from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and VOBA expense increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force block of business. Overall general operating expenses before deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable prior year period due to expense control. This reduction includes a $0.7 million charge associated with restructuring of the sales force in our independent division. Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the prior year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $14 million, or 28%, from $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was caused primarily by smaller spreads between investment income earned and the fixed benefits credited to policyholders, increased growth credited on the Consumer Price Index block of business and higher utilization of the early pay off feature. Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or 30%, from $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment income before tax. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $38 million, or 6%, from $689 million in 2001 to $727 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $31 million, or 6%, from $507 million in 2001 to $538 million in 2002. The increase was driven by a $15 million increase in net earned premiums in 2002 in our AMLIC channel due to an increase in the average size of the policies sold and increased earned premiums from the independent channel due to increased sales through expansion of pre need counselors. Policy size increased due to a change in packaging of funerals sold by SCI. Net investment income increased by $5 million, or 3%, from $179 million in 2001 to $184 million in 2002. An 8% increase in average allocated invested assets in 2002 resulting from the growth in force policies resulted in additional investment income in 2002. Offsetting the increase in invested assets was a 34 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.91% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate environment and restructuring of the investment portfolio to enhance credit quality. The decline in yields reduced investment income in 2002. Fees and other income increased by $2 million, or 66%, from $3 million in 2001 to $5 million in 2002. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $44 million, or 7%, from $606 million in 2001 to $650 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits increased by $27 million, or 6%, from $486 million in 2001 to $513 million in 2002. The increase in policyholder benefits was consistent with the increase in business written, partially offset by other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies uses a Consumer Price Index rate as a growth rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate decreased from 3.36% in 2001 to 1.97% in 69 Table of Contents 2002. This reduced policyholder benefits by $6 million in 2002. In addition, benefit expense increased by $3 million from 2001 to 2002 related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversion from limited pay policies to single pay policies. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $17 million, or 14%, from $120 million in 2001 to $137 million in 2002. The primary reason for the increase was an increase in amortization of DAC and VOBA of $12 million in 2002, as a result of the increased sales of single pay policies versus plans paid over a three , five and ten year period. The acquisition costs on single pay policies are amortized in the year of issue, thus causing the increase in expense levels in 2002 over 2001. All other expenses increased by $5 million in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to the increase in premiums. Our mix of business has been moving toward more single pay policies relative to multi pay policies increasing our expenses in any given year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $4 million, or 7%, from $54 million in 2001 to $50 million in 2002. This was caused primarily by smaller spreads between our investment yields and rates we credited to our policyholders. Also, profits were lower due to higher utilization of the early pay off feature described above and higher mortality, offset by the lower Consumer Price Index credited growth. Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 7%, from $29 million in 2001 to $27 million in 2002, which was largely consistent with the 7% decrease in segment income before income tax. Corporate and Other Overview The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results of operations of FFG, from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of FFG and LTC. 70 Table of Contents The table below presents information regarding Corporate and Others segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ $ $ 58 Net investment income 43 40 112 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 2 (118 ) (119 ) Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 68 80 68 Gain on disposal of businesses 11 62 Fees and other income 11 25 67 Total revenues 124 38 248 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (70 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (69 ) (55 ) (120 ) Interest expense (1 ) (14 ) Distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (113 ) (118 ) (118 ) Interest premiums on redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (389 ) (173 ) (322 ) Segment income before income tax (265 ) (135 ) (74 ) Income taxes 99 61 21 Segment income after tax $ (166 ) $ (74 ) $ (53 ) As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $393 million (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. The Corporate and Other segments financial results were affected by the April 2, 2001 sale of FFG. Below are the results of FFG that have been included in the Corporate and Other segment from January 1, 2001 through March 31, 2001. 71 Table of Contents January 1 through March 31, 2001 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 49 Net investment income 32 Fees and other income 65 Total revenues 146 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (48 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (86 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (134 ) Income before income tax 12 Income taxes (4 ) Income after tax $ 8 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $86 million, or 226%, from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net investment income increased by $3 million, or 8%, from $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 56%, from $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in 2002 associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily 72 Table of Contents due to $14 million of consulting and compensation expenses incurred in 2003, related to our initial public offering in February 2004. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million of interest premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero recognized in 2002. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $92 million, or 124%, from $74 million in 2002 to $166 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to the $206 million of interest premiums incurred related to early extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, partially offset by the favorable $120 million change in net realized capital gains (losses) on investments. Income tax benefit increased by $38 million, or 62%, from $61 million in 2002 to $99 million in 2003. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31, 2001 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $210 million, or 85%, from $248 million in 2001 to $38 million in 2002. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $58 million, or 100%, from $58 million in 2001 to zero in 2002 due to the sale of FFG. Net investment income decreased by $72 million, or 64%, from $112 million in 2001 to $40 million in 2002. Excluding the $32 million reduction in investment income from the sale of FFG, net investment income decreased in 2002 as a result of a decrease in invested assets because we paid down debt and acquired CORE and DBD. Net realized losses on investments decreased by $1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to $118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other than temporary impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001 consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in Enron. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from $68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002, mainly due a to full year of amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of FFG as compared to nine months of amortization in 2001. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to $11 million in 2002. This decrease was due to the sale of FFGs mutual fund operations. Also, on June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million in 2002. Fees and other income decreased by $42 million, or 63%, from $67 million in 2001 to $25 million in 2002. Excluding the $65 million reduction in other income due to the sale of FFG, fees and other income increased by $23 million in 2002 mainly due to approximately $15 million of income associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. 73 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $149 million, or 46%, from $322 million in 2001 to $173 million in 2002. Policyholder benefits decreased by $70 million, or 100%, from $70 million in 2001 to zero in 2002. The decrease was entirely due to the sale of FFG. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $65 million, or 54%, from $120 million in 2001 to $55 million in 2002. Excluding the $86 million reduction in selling, underwriting and general expenses attributable to the sale of FFG, these expenses increased by $21 million from 2001 to 2002. Interest expense decreased by $14 million, or 100%, from $14 million in 2001 to zero in 2002. We used a portion of the FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of debt owed to Fortis Finance. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at $118 million. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $21 million, or 40%, from a $53 million loss in 2001 to a $74 million loss in 2002, primarily due to the sale of FFG. Income taxes increased by $40 million, or 190%, from $21 million in 2001 to $61 million in 2002. Excluding the $4 million reduction in income tax expenses due to the sale of FFG, income tax benefit increased by $44 million in 2002. The change in the income tax benefit was largely consistent with the increase in segment losses before income tax. In 2002, we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Fixed maturities $ 8,729 80 % $ 8,036 80 % $ 7,630 79 % Equity securities 456 4 272 3 247 3 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 933 9 842 8 869 9 Policy loans 68 1 69 1 68 1 Short term investments 276 2 684 7 627 6 Other investments 462 4 181 1 209 2 Total investments $ 10,924 100 % $ 10,084 100 % $ 9,650 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 70% and 75% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. As interest rates decrease, the market value of fixed maturity securities increases. 74 Table of Contents The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (pre tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,230 $ 7,631 $ 7,471 Net unrealized gains 499 405 159 Fair value $ 8,729 $ 8,036 $ 7,630 Equities: Cost $ 437 $ 265 $ 243 Net unrealized gains 19 7 4 Fair value $ 456 $ 272 $ 247 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $94 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The increase in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the decline in investment grade corporate securities yield spreads combined with an increase in Treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade corporate securities fell by approximately 119 basis points while yields on 10 year Treasury securities increased by 44 basis points between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $246 million, or 155%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. This reflected the impact of declining market interest rates. Yields on 10 year U.S. Treasury bonds decreased by 121 basis points from 5.03% at December 31, 2001, to 3.82% at December 31, 2002. Net unrealized gains on equity securities increased by $12 million, or 171%, from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003 and by $3 million, or 75%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Reserves The following table presents reserve information as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Future policy benefits and expenses $ 6,235 $ 5,807 $ 5,547 Unearned premiums 3,134 3,208 3,267 Claims and benefits payable 3,513 3,374 3,250 Total policy liabilities $ 12,882 $ 12,389 $ 12,064 Future policy benefits and expenses increased by $428 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and by $260 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. Unearned premiums decreased by $74 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and by $59 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The decrease is primarily driven by the run off of our credit life and disability contracts, offset by growth in other short duration contracts. Claims and benefits payable increased by $139 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and increased by $124 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. 75 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Future Future Policy Claims Policy Claims Benefits and Benefits and and Unearned Benefits and Unearned Benefits Expenses Premiums Payable Expenses Premiums Payable (In millions) Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 2,276 $ 3 $ 14 $ 1,991 $ 3 $ 15 Life insurance no longer offered 688 1 4 693 1 5 Universal life and annuities no longer offered 322 1 17 334 1 12 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,744 48 177 2,619 48 139 All other 205 57 151 170 75 167 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 13 394 11 457 Group disability 4 1,375 4 1,299 Medical 67 266 43 202 Dental 7 39 8 44 Property and warranty 1,149 621 1,135 536 Credit life and disability 759 403 1,074 445 Extended service contracts 1,023 18 803 16 All other 2 34 2 37 Total policy liabilities $ 6,235 $ 3,134 $ 3,513 $ 5,807 $ 3,208 $ 3,374 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Long Duration The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Pre Funded Funeral Life Insurance Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Loss recognition testing is performed annually. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. 76 Table of Contents Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $52 million higher (or lower). If claim termination rates were 10% lower (or higher) than currently assumed, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $38 million higher (or lower). The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be approximately $13 million higher (or lower). As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Disability incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $53 million more, $3 million less and $7 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Group Disability reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003, and its related upward revision reflects the result of reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based on results of those studies, reserves were increased by $44 million, almost all of which was attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to reflect current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability reserve redundancies in 2002 and 2001, which were less than 1% of prior year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning of year case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year case reserves. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Term Life incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $93 million, $29 million and $35 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A significant portion of the Group Term Life reserve is related to waiver of premium reserves for disabled claimants. Group Term Life waiver of premium reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. Reductions in the Group Term Life reserves reflected the results of reserve adequacy studies conducted in the third quarter of 2003. Based on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by $59 million. The change in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested assets, and recent mortality and recovery 77 Table of Contents experience. Another portion of the Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years described above, was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our beginning of year reserves and recovery rates being higher than assumed in our beginning of year waiver of premium reserves. The remaining redundancy and related downward revision were due to shorter than expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid claim dates. These amounts were offset by one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year waiver of premium reserves. The conclusion of the reserve studies determined that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million, which includes $3 million of reserve release relating to the group dental business. Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss development factors for the most recent four months would result in approximately $22 million higher (or lower) reserves at December 31, 2003. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 85% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in our Medical business related to prior years were $58 million, $43 million and $48 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the short tail nature of this business, these developments relate to claims incurred in the preceding year (i.e., in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The redundancies in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical reserve estimates, were caused by our claims developing more favorably than expected. Our actual claims experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and lower medical inflation than assumed in our prior year pricing and reserving processes. The differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates, medical provider utilization and medical inflation reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages which we no longer write (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. 78 Table of Contents We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate of reserves is selected from the middle to upper end of third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in our Property and Warranty lines of business related to prior years were $13 million less, $2 million more and $27 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The redundancy in our Property and Warranty lines of business, and the related downward revisions in our estimated reserves in 2001 occurred mostly in our credit unemployment and credit property insurance coverages, whereas the other coverages showed immaterial adjustments to prior years incurred losses. The small deficiency in 2002 largely reflected a shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional development and the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, resulting in a modest redundancy. These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual claim frequencies differing from the best estimate claim frequencies, and differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the periods they emerge. For the longer tail Property and Warranty coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident), there were no changes in estimated amounts for incurred claims in prior years for all years. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years, and the related downward revisions in estimated reserves, was attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in the results of operations. Reinsurance The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of As of December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Reinsurance recoverables $ 4,445 $ 4,650 Reinsurance recoverables decreased by $205 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,410 million at December 31, 2003 and $2,255 million at December 31, 2002. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2003 2002 (In millions) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,551 $ 2,452 Ceded unearned premium 971 1,277 Ceded claims and benefits payable 788 744 Ceded paid losses 135 177 Total $ 4,445 $ 4,650 79 Table of Contents We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases to facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal entities with business segments that we retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still reflected in our balance sheet. The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was $1,537 million and $1,558 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was $873 million and $697 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We would be responsible for administering this business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a default by reinsurers. Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows 80 Table of Contents depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2003, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was $290 million. For a discussion of the various restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, see Item 1 Business Regulation and Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy. Dividends and other interest income paid by our subsidiaries totaled $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $615.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Figures for 2001 were higher due to a gain on the sale of FFG. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to perform other acquisitions, to make interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend payments to our stockholders. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. Historically, Fortis has maintained a $1 billion commercial paper facility that we have been able to access (via intercompany loans) for up to $750 million. We use the commercial paper facility to cover any cash shortfalls, which may occur from time to time. During 2003, we accessed $75 million of this facility for 3 days in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. We had no commercial paper borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2001, $217 million in commercial paper was issued and redeemed. There was no outstanding commercial paper at year end 2001. In connection with our separation from Fortis, we no longer have access to this facility. In March 2004, we intend to establish a $500 million commercial paper program, which will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at the subsidiary level. In December 2003, we entered into two senior bridge credit facilities of $650 million and $1,100 million. The aggregate indebtedness of $1,750 million under the facility was in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. On January 30, 2004, we entered into a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are not in default. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. As of March 11, 2004 we are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. On February 5, 2004, we received a $725.5 million capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with the closing IPO. The proceeds from that contribution were used to repay the $650 million of outstanding indebtedness under the senior bridge credit facility and $75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition, we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the 81 Table of Contents $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our $975 million senior note offering described below. On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975 million. The first series is $500 million in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our $1.1 billion senior bridge facility. At the time of offering our senior notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement. The registration rights agreement requires us to file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the exchange of the senior notes for registered notes having nearly identical terms as the senior notes or to permit the registered resale of the senior notes. If we fail to comply with the filing requirements under our registration rights agreement within certain time periods, the interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase. Our qualified pension plan was under funded by $60 million at December 31, 2003. In accordance with ERISA, there is no expected minimum funding requirement for 2004 or 2005. Our nonqualified plan, which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of $72 million at December 31, 2003. The expected Company payments to retirees under this plan are approximately $4 million per year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our post retirement plans (other than pension), which are partially funded with $7 million of assets, had an accumulated post retirement benefit obligation of $51 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the expected Company payments to retirees and dependents under the postretirement plan are approximately $1.2 million per year in 2004 and 2005. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. We estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our name change and rebranding initiative will be approximately $10 million, which we will expense in 2004. We are not currently planning to make any other significant capital expenditures in 2004 or 2005. During January 2004 we paid to participants in the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of $25 million in connection with the cash out of all outstanding Fortis, Inc. incentive rights. See Item 11 Executive Compensation Long Term Incentive Plan Awards. In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs. 82 Table of Contents The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 741 $ 365 $ 632 Investing activities (711 ) (380 ) (218 ) Financing activities 317 (43 ) (380 ) Net change in cash $ 347 $ (58 ) $ 34 Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The key changes of the net cash inflow of $347 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,929 million, maturities of these securities of $1,131 million, and issuance of debt in the amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,164 million and maturities of these securities of $858 million. Key changes of the net cash inflow of $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 were the sale of FFG for $385 million in cash and changes in our revenues and expenses from operating activities as described above. At December 31, 2003, we had total debt outstanding of $1,970 million, as compared to $1,471 million at December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2003 this debt consisted of $1,750 million of two senior bridge credit facility arrangements, $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and $24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 this debt consisted of trust capital securities, which we classify as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and a small amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, Security 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts and interest paid $ 128,694 $ 117,114 $ 133,667 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends 963 1,052 1,053 Class A Common Stock dividends 139,310 67,000 Class B and C Common Stock dividends 41,877 41,876 42,298 Total $ 310,844 $ 160,042 $ 244,018 83 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2003, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less than More than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In thousands) Contractual obligations: Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts $ 196,224 $ $ $ $ 196,224 Debt 1,750,000 1,750,000 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 24,160 24,160 Operating leases 39,622 67,406 48,802 44,533 200,363 Commitments: Interest premiums on redemption of preferred securities of subsidiary trusts 66,734 66,734 Investment purchases Outstanding: unsettled trades 39,552 39,552 commercial mortgage loans on real estate 75,900 75,900 other investments 22,429 22,429 Total obligations and commitments $ 2,190,461 $ 67,406 $ 48,802 $ 68,693 $ 2,375,362 In December 2003 and January 2004, we redeemed all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to their aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and aggregate premium of approximately $206 million, all of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge credit facilities described under Liquidity and Capital Resources in connection with these redemptions. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $118 million and $120 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, we had an unused $50 million letter of credit facility. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Company Our profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business. Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties with which we do business are important to the success of our business segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with several mortgage lenders 84 Table of Contents and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers and other financial institutions through which we distribute our products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution relationships for our individual health insurance products with IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm USAA and Mutual of Omaha, as well as a relationship with Health Advocates Alliance, the association through which we provide many of our individual health insurance products through Assurant Healths agreement dated September 1, 2003 with its administrator, National Administration Company, Inc. The agreement that provides for our exclusive distribution relationship with IPSI terminates in July 2004, but may be extended if agreed to by both parties. We also maintain contractual relationships with several separate networks of health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. In Assurant PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one to five years. Although we believe we have generally been successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to terminate these arrangements, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services, which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with PPOs could also lead to higher medical or dental costs and or a loss of members to other medical or dental plans. For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few clients over the last three years as a result of bankruptcies and termination of contracts either by it or its clients; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. At Assurant Health, client turnover increased slightly over the last three years from issues related to the slowing economy, particularly in 2001 through early 2003; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Similar to Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits client turnover increased slightly over the last three years from issues related to the slowing economy, particularly in 2001 through early 2003, such as companies going out of business and businesses no longer providing benefits; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Assurant PreNeed terminated client relationships with three funeral home groups in 2003 because of profitability issues with the business; however, none of the clients terminated was significant to its business. Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or develop and maintain distribution sources. We distribute our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels including: independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life agents, financial institutions, funeral directors, association groups and other third party marketing organizations. We do not distribute our insurance products and services through captive or affiliated agents except for a small number of affiliated agents at Assurant Health. Our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. In Assurant Health, we depend in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on associations, including Health Advocates Alliance, in the marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our customers, market and distribute our products. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us and usually also market products of our competitors. Strong competition exists among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales representatives, agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. In addition, by relying on independent agents and brokers to distribute products for us, we face continued competition from our competitors products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory environment. Recently, the marketing of health insurance through association groups has come under increased scrutiny. An interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various third party distributors or our inability to respond to regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 85 Table of Contents We have our own sales representatives whose role in the distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. General economic, financial market and political conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions. These conditions include economic cycles such as insurance industry cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer lending, levels of inflation and movements of the financial markets. Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy, demographics, and legislative and competitive factors also influence our performance. During periods of economic downturn: individuals and businesses may choose not to purchase our insurance products and other related products and services, may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased or, in Assurant Employee Benefits and in small group employer health insurance in Assurant Health, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to rising unemployment levels; new disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise; there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment levels; and insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits. In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our pre funded funeral insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index. Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and capital. We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles (SAP), do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. During the past three years, we did not experience substantial deviations in actual claims losses from reserve estimates previously established. However, future loss 86 Table of Contents development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss limitation methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and property coverages. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by: changes in health and dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments. The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes, by insurance regulations, existing contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions or other factors. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads. Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death benefit growth rates on pre funded funeral insurance policies and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves related to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on current interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and or new claims would need to be calculated using lower discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates. Catastrophe losses, including man made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other personal business lines. We have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, 87 Table of Contents catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics, or can be man made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible that both the frequency and severity of man made catastrophes will increase and that we will not be able to implement exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance for such catastrophes. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal lines coverages, which for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents approximately 24% of our net earned premiums and other considerations in our Assurant Solutions segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2003, approximately 34% of the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal lines relates to properties located in California, Florida and Texas. As a result of our creditor placed homeowners insurance product, our concentration in these areas may increase in the future. This is because in our creditor placed homeowners insurance line, we agree to provide homeowners insurance coverage automatically. If other insurers withdraw coverage in these or other states, this may lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our creditor placed homeowners insurance in these areas. Claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Our ability to write new business also could be affected. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophes in the future. Pre tax catastrophe losses in excess of $1 million (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent years are: total losses of approximately $10 million incurred in 2001 in connection with tropical storm Allison; total losses of approximately $12 million incurred in 2002 in connection with Arizona wildfires, Texas floods and Hurricane Lili; and total losses of approximately $30 million incurred in 2003 in connection with various catastrophes caused by windstorms, hailstorms, tornadoes, Hurricane Isabel, and wildfires in southern California. In addition, our group life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care. For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths. Losses due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our successful utilization of catastrophic property and life reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a single event or multiple events, and life and disability reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently widely available. This means that the occurrence of a significant catastrophe could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in Assurant PreNeed the average age of policyholders is in excess of 70 years. This group is more susceptible to epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 88 Table of Contents Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to the terrorist assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance for man made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity constraints and, to the limited extent available, much more expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results. If we fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect our ability to write future business. As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life, property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent. We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of FFG to The Hartford. The assets backing the liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust, and the separate accounts relating to the FFG business are still reflected on our balance sheet. However, we would be responsible for administering this business in the event of a default by the reinsurer. We do not have the administrative systems and capabilities to process this business today. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to increase the value of the separate accounts relating to the business sold if such value declines. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make these payments. We are exposed to the credit risk of our agents in Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant Solutions. We advance agents commissions as part of our pre funded funeral insurance product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage as opposed to a percentage of the first year premium paid, the formula that is more common in other life insurance markets. There is a one year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. There is a very large producer within Assurant PreNeed and if it were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, we have not had any loss experience with this very large producer to date. In addition, we are subject to the credit risk of the parties with which we contract in Assurant Solutions. If these parties fail to remit payments owed to us or pass on payments they collect on our behalf, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, a client with whom we do business has declared bankruptcy. In the event that this client does not honor its claims obligation, we would be liable for making payment, which we estimate to be approximately $37 million, net of offsetting collateral, 89 Table of Contents as of December 31, 2003. We would also be responsible for administering such claims. Probable and estimable loss contingencies associated with this risk have been accrued. A further decline in the manufactured housing market may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant decline in both shipments and retail sales in the last five years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased from approximately 370,000 in 1998 to 130,000 in 2003, representing a 65% decline. Repossessions are at an all time high, resale values have been significantly reduced and several lenders, dealers, manufacturers and vertically integrated manufactured housing companies have either ceased operations or gone bankrupt. This downturn in the industry is the result of several factors, including excess production, aggressive sales practices, reduced underwriting standards and poor lending practices. As a result of this downturn, the industry has experienced consolidation, with the leaders purchasing the weaker competitors. If these downward trends continue, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moodys and seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P and Fitch. The ratings reflect A.M. Bests, Moodys, S&Ps and Fitchs opinions of our subsidiaries financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. The ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P and Fitch, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings. Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A are Excellent). Our other domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Moodys financial strength rating is A2 (Good) for one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are Good), and A3 (Good) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The S&P financial strength rating is A (Strong) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A are Strong), and A (Strong) for two of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Fitch financial strength rating for the seven rated domestic insurance companies is A (Strong) which is the third highest of twelve rating categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A, and A are Strong). Rating agencies review their ratings periodically and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P or Fitch, or placed under surveillance or review with possible negative implications, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could suffer and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to, among other things: the competitive 90 Table of Contents environment in the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. As customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, S&P or Fitch, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Contracts representing approximately 18% of Assurant Solutions net earned premiums and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2003 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from A or better to B or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts if the subsidiaries ratings fall below these minimum acceptable levels. Under our ten year marketing agreement with SCI, American Memorial Life Insurance Company (AMLIC), one of our subsidiaries in the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. In our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments, we do not have any material contracts that permit termination in the case of a ratings downgrade. Since January 1, 2000, none of the A.M. Best ratings for our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries has been downgraded. On September 25, 2003, the Moodys financial strength rating for Fortis Benefits Insurance Company, one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, was downgraded from A1 (Good) to A2 (Good) and the financial strength rating for John Alden Life Insurance Company, another domestic operating insurance subsidiary, was downgraded from A2 (Good) to A3 (Good) in contemplation of the fact that we would no longer be wholly owned by Fortis. In addition, on May 2, 2003, Moodys downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Fortis Benefits Insurance Company from Aa3 (Excellent) to A1 (Good) corresponding to the downgrading of Fortis. These recent downgrades did not have a quantifiable impact on the business of these subsidiaries primarily because our operating insurance companies rely solely on the ratings of A.M. Best for the marketing and sale of their products. The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is dependent upon our ability to keep up to date with technological advances. This is particularly important in Assurant Solutions, where our systems, including our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients, are critical to the operation of our business. Our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we have spent approximately $90 million in Assurant Solutions, $55 million in Assurant Health, $43 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $4 million in Assurant PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information systems. In 2004, we plan to spend for these purposes approximately $124 million in Assurant Solutions, $73 million in Assurant Health, $53 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed. In addition, our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we do not maintain 91 Table of Contents adequate systems we could experience adverse consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers; customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation exposure; or increases in administrative expenses. Our management information, internal control and financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and development to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements of being a public company. Failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, reduction to our profitability and or subject us to fines and penalties. A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health segment is the subject of national and state legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and certain of the activities conducted by our Assurant Solutions segment are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect such confidential information vary by business segment and may include among other things: training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information; actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information and maintaining a clean desk policy aimed at safeguarding certain current information. In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory problems, loss of reputation and client litigation. See Risks Related to Our Industry Cost of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. While our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new insurance ventures have played a significant role in achieving desired market positions in some, but not all, of our businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including among other things: inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that most of our acquisitions have been successful and 92 Table of Contents have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, we did recognize a goodwill impairment of $1,261 million in 2002 related to an earlier acquisition. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder dividends. As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiarys assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary. The payment of dividends to us by any of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiarys domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for more than half of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the greater of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior years statutory net income. In the remaining states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, the formula is the lesser amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. In addition, as part of the regulatory approval process for the acquisition of ABIG in 1999, we entered into an agreement with the Florida Insurance Department pursuant to which, until August of 2004, two of our subsidiaries have agreed to limit the amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to us to an amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise permitted under Florida law. Likewise, one of our subsidiaries, First Fortis Life Insurance Company, entered into an agreement with the New York Insurance Department as part of the regulatory approval process for the merger of Bankers American Life Assurance Company into First Fortis Life Insurance Company in 2001 pursuant to which it has agreed not to pay any ordinary dividends to us until fiscal year 2004. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States State Regulation Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us in 2003 without regulatory approval was approximately $290 million, of which approximately $99.5 million was paid during 2003. We expect that as a result of, among other things, statutory accounting for our sold businesses, the maximum amount of dividends our subsidiaries will be able to pay to us will be significantly lower in 2004. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses. Our $500 million senior revolving credit facility dated as of January 30, 2004 and our Series B and Series C Preferred Stock also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends. See Item 5 Market for 93 Table of Contents Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matter and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Preferred Stock and Dividend Policy. Risks Related to Our Industry We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be profitable. In each of our lines of business, we compete with other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line and product, although we have no single competitor who competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate. Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities. Competitors include insurance companies and financial institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors include health insurance companies and the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include benefits and life insurance companies as well as not for profit Delta Dental plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two pre need life insurance companies with nationwide representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business. Competition in our businesses is based on many factors, including quality of service, product features, price, scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies. We compete not only for business and individual customers, employer and other group customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without being subject to insurance regulations. Also, as a result of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which was enacted in November 1999, financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our own. This has resulted in new competitors with significant financial resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do, which may lead them to price their products and services lower than we do. In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. For example, several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a substantial market share. In addition, with regard to Assurant Health, organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able to compete effectively in such markets. New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers. 94 Table of Contents The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our results. The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for periods ranging from two to six years. The segments of the insurance markets in which we operate tend not to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality. Periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of underwriting capacity permit more favorable rate levels, consequent fluctuations in underwriting results and the occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these markets. Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the insurer, including competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. This may cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our product prices in order to maintain our market position, because of the adverse effect on profitability of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations of appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other factors affecting the insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results. The nature of the market for the insurance and related products and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting our industries to periodic negative publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. In addition to the occasional employment related litigation to which all businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to, our insurance and other related business operations. We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to: disputes over coverage or claims adjudication; disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements; disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims; disputes concerning past premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race; disputes relating to customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various business segments; disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions; disputes relating to certain excess of loss programs in the London market; disputes with taxing authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us. 95 Table of Contents In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies. Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses. There are various governmental and administrative investigations and proceedings pending against us. For example, an indictment has been issued in Minnesota alleging that one of our subsidiaries and two corporate officers of Assurant Solutions each violated the Minnesota Fair Campaign Practices Act. The outcome of these investigations and proceedings cannot be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such investigations or proceedings or any litigation would not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; authorizing lines of business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating underwriting limitations; imposing dividend limitations; regulating changes in control; licensing agents and distributors of insurance products; placing limitations on the minimum and maximum size of life insurance contracts; restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets; admitting statutory assets; mandating certain insurance benefits; restricting companies ability to terminate or cancel coverage; requiring companies to provide certain types of coverage; regulating premium rates, including the ability to increase premium rates; approving policy forms; regulating trade and claims practices; imposing privacy requirements; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; restricting certain transactions between affiliates; regulating the content of disclosures to debtors in the credit insurance area; regulating the type, amounts and valuation of investments; mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds; regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents; and 96 Table of Contents restricting contact with consumers, such as the recently created national do not call list, and imposing consumer protection measures. Assurant Health is also required by some jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by insurers. Each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to some risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of individuals. HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning July 1, 1997. See also Risks Related to Our Industry Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The capacity for an insurance companys growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices and procedures, is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies. We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. That type of action could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions; limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impositions of fines, taxes or other penalties for improper licensing, the failure to promptly pay claims, however defined, or other regulatory violations; increased licensing requirements; 97 Table of Contents prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations; new benefit mandates; increased regulation relating to the use of associations and trusts in the sale of individual health insurance; limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and, as a result, manage health care and utilization due to any willing provider legislation, which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement; limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider; and restriction of solicitation of pre funded funeral insurance consumers by funeral board laws. State legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory projects, all of which can affect our operations. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, could significantly harm the insurance industry and us. Federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. In addition, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care issues. The U.S. Congress is considering Patients Bill of Rights legislation, which, if adopted, would permit health plans to be sued in state court for coverage determinations and could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). There recently have been legislative attempts to limit ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. For example, the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would, among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures, require plans to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a national health insurance program. Any of these proposals, if implemented, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Federal changes in Medicare and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have negative implications for the private sector due to cost shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers. State small employer group and individual health insurance market reforms to increase access and affordability could also reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing for risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance policies. In addition, the U.S. Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to 98 Table of Contents allow an optional federal incorporation, similar to banks. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the federal government has granted charters in years past to insurance like organizations that are not subject to state insurance regulations, such as risk retention groups. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States Federal Regulation Legislative Developments. Thus, it is hard to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or on us. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. In addition, the insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The privacy of individuals has been the subject of recent state and federal legislation. State privacy laws, particularly those with opt in clauses, can affect the pre funded funeral insurance business. These laws make it harder to share information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created do not call list would restrict our ability to contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our expectations for growth in our direct marketed consumer credit insurance products in the United States. HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have thus far been adopted impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. We have been working diligently to comply with these regulations in the time periods required. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of the required transactions or that other entities with which we interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims. HIPAA is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Known and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties. In addition, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of the insurance policy and annually thereafter. Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements. However, certain state laws may require individuals to opt in to information sharing instead of being immediately included. This could significantly increase costs of doing business. Additionally, when final U.S. Treasury Department regulations are promulgated in connection with the USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to expend additional resources to tailor our existing anti fraud efforts to the new rules. Risks Related to Our Relationship with and Separation from Fortis Fortis will continue to have representation on our board of directors and influence our affairs for as long as it remains a significant stockholder. 99 Table of Contents As of February 5, 2004, Fortis, through Fortis Insurance N.V., its wholly owned subsidiary, owned approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. For as long as Fortis continues to own shares of common stock representing more than one third of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, it will be able to veto corporate actions requiring a two thirds vote of our stockholders. Fortis may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. We have entered into a shareholders agreement with Fortis pursuant to which Fortis has the right to nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, two designees (out of a maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our board of directors. In addition, although Fortis has advised us that it intends to divest all of its shares of our common stock over a period of time, Fortis is under no obligation to do so. Subject to the terms of the lock up agreement described below, Fortis has the sole discretion to determine the timing of any such divestiture. See Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for additional information on lock up agreements and related party transactions between our Company and Fortis. In addition, for so long as Fortis continues to own less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, the following will also apply: Our board of directors shall consist of no more than 12 directors (including at least seven independent directors); Fortis will have the right to nominate two designees to our board of directors (out of a maximum of 12 directors), and the shareholders agreement and our by laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees; and Pursuant to the shareholders agreement, the following significant corporate actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis Insurance, as shareholder: any recapitalization, reclassification, spin off or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries; or any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceedings with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries. Because Fortis will control us, conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could arise which may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us, including, but not limited to, the following areas: Stock Ownership. So long as Fortis owns shares of common stock representing more than one third of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, Fortis will be able to veto mergers and the sale of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets. With certain limited exceptions, Fortis, exercising its rights as a stockholder, can veto a merger or sale without regard to the interests of the other stockholders. In addition, the shareholders agreement also provides that for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, the following actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis Insurance N.V., as stockholder: any recapitalization, reclassification or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries (other than certain activities between wholly owned subsidiaries); and 100 Table of Contents any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to us or our principal subsidiaries. For more information regarding the shareholders agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Shareholders Agreement. Cross Directorships. Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are directors of our Company who are also currently directors and or officers of Fortis. Service as both a director of our Company and as a director or officer of Fortis or ownership interests of directors or officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. Our directors who are also directors or officers of Fortis will have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For example, these decisions could relate to: disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition or disposition opportunity; or corporate finance decisions. Allocation of Business Opportunities. Although we do not expect Fortis to compete with us in the near term, there may be business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis and us. Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to Fortis and we may have no recourse against the Fortis designees or Fortis. We have no formal mechanisms for allocating business opportunities. The loss of the Fortis name in Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant PreNeed may affect our profitability. In connection with our separation from Fortis, we have changed our name and the names of our business units to Assurant, Inc. and other Assurant names and have launched a re branding initiative pursuant to which we will change our brand name and most of the trademarks and trade names under which we conduct our business. The transition to our new name in each of our business segments and subsidiaries will occur rapidly in the case of some products and business segments and over specified periods in the case of other products and business segments. Under the terms of a license from Fortis, we have only a limited amount of time to continue to use the Fortis name. Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant PreNeed have expended substantial resources to establish the Fortis name and reputation in the health, employee benefits and pre funded funeral insurance marketplace, particularly among brokers and consultants acting as advisors in the health and benefits market and with funeral directors in the pre funded funeral market. The impact of the change in trademarks and trade names and other changes (including, without limitation, the name change) on our business and operations cannot be fully predicted, and the lack of an established brand image for the Assurant name in the health, benefits and pre funded funeral insurance marketplace may cause a disruption in sales and persistency and thus affect profitability. Any such disruption could also cause rating agencies to lower our financial strength and other ratings in the future. In addition, the costs of effecting the name change and branding initiative will be substantial and are currently estimated to be approximately $10 million. In certain states we may be required to notify policyholders of our name change and in certain instances new certificates may need to be issued. This might result in increased lapses of our insurance policies. Because Fortis operates U.S. branch offices, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA). Fortis Bank SA/NV (Fortis Bank), which is a subsidiary of Fortis, obtained approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the Federal Reserve Board to establish branch offices in Connecticut and New York. By virtue of the opening of these offices, the U.S. operations of Fortis, including our operations, became subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the BHCA. In order to continue to operate its U.S. nonbanking operations, including the insurance activities conducted by our subsidiaries, Fortis notified the Federal Reserve Board of its election to be a financial holding company for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal Reserve Boards implementing regulations in Regulation Y. Pursuant to Fortis status as a financial 101 Table of Contents holding company, Fortis and its subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries, are permitted to engage in nonbanking activities in the United States that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity as defined in Section 4(k) of the BHCA and in Regulation Y. In particular, Fortis status as a financial holding company permits Fortis to engage in the United States in both banking activities through the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank and insurance activities through our subsidiaries. Activities that are financial in nature include, among other things: insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or providing and issuing annuities; and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing. Fortis will continue to qualify as a financial holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains well capitalized and well managed as those terms are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be considered well capitalized if it maintains tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively, and will be considered well managed if it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. As a general matter, as long as Fortis controls us within the meaning of the BHCA or owns more than 5% of any class of our voting shares, the BHCA does not permit us to engage in nonfinancial activities such as manufacturing, distribution of goods and real estate development except to the extent that another exemption under the BHCA, such as the merchant banking exemption, is available. If the Federal Reserve Board were to determine that any of our existing activities were not insurance activities or not otherwise financial in nature or not incidental to such activities, or if Fortis lost and was unable to regain its financial holding company status, we could be required to restructure our operations or divest some of these operations, which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability. The Federal Reserve Board oversees all of Fortis direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries for compliance with the BHCA, including our Company. Our Company will be considered a subsidiary of Fortis so long as Fortis owns 25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise controls us within the meaning of the BHCA. In addition, even if we are not a subsidiary of Fortis, the nonfinancial activities restrictions of the BHCA and Regulation Y (discussed above) would continue to apply so long as Fortis owned more than 5% of any class of our voting shares and another BHCA exemption, such as the merchant banking exemption, is not available. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate the entrenchment of directors, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. The following provisions included in our certificate of incorporation and by laws have anti takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by laws: permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; divide our board of directors into three classes; limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; 102 Table of Contents except for Fortis, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors; prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent; impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; subject to limited exceptions, require the approval of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter to approve mergers and consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and require the approval by the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter for the stockholders to amend the provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation described in the second through seventh bullet points above and this supermajority provision. In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to affect a change of control of our Company. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person acquiring 5% or more of shares of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the applicants plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. From time to time, the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in operating results; natural disasters and terrorist attacks; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; press releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our markets; regulatory changes; sales of stock by insiders; and changes in our financial strength ratings. 103 Table of Contents In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility that the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. As of December 31, 2003, we held $8,729 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $933 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 88% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2002, we held $8,036 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $842 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 88% of total invested assets. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. 104 Table of Contents The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying yield curves. We have assumed that both the United States and Canadian yield curves have a 100% correlation and, therefore, move together. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2003 100 50 0 50 100 (In millions) Total market value $ 9,255 $ 8,989 $ 8,729 $ 8,472 $ 8,224 % Change in market value from base case 6.0 % 3.0 % 0.00 % (2.9 )% (5.8 )% $ Change in market value from base case $ 526 $ 260 $ 0 $ (257 ) $ (505 ) Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. See Item 1 Business Investments. The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2003: Percentage Rating Fair Value of Total (In millions) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,074 70% Baa 2,110 24% Ba 361 4% B and lower 184 2% Total $ 8,729 100% We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $4,445 million of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2003, we are protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,537 million and $873 million as of December 31, 2003 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of 105 Table of Contents the assets in these trusts decreases, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 16% of Assurant PreNeeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $391 million as of December 31, 2003 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing a contract with payments tied to the Consumer Price Index. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily British pounds and Danish krone. Total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 1% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2003. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. We assess our foreign exchange risk by examining the foreign exchange rate exposure of the excess of invested assets over the statutory reserve liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Two stress scenarios are examined. The first scenario assumes a hypothetical 10% immediate change in the foreign exchange rate. The second scenario assumes a more severe 2.33 standard deviation event (comparable to a one in 100 probability under a normal distribution). The modeling techniques we use to calculate our exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates or correlation among various markets. Our actual experience may differ due to correlation assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology, such as significant illiquidity or other market events. Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. 106 Table of Contents On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract to partially hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our pre funded funeral insurance policies. See Inflation risk. In 2003, we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we transferred the invested assets related to this coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments in the December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003.
