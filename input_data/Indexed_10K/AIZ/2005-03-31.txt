The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance products and related services in North America and selected other markets. We provide: creditor placed homeowners insurance; manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended service contracts; individual health and small employer group health 50 Table of Contents insurance; group dental insurance; group disability insurance; group life insurance and pre funded funeral insurance. The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive profit opportunities. We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. As such, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Revenues We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Our investment portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates, and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 83% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death benefit growth that is either pegged to changes in the CPI or determined periodically at the discretion of the Company. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates 51 Table of Contents and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Expenses Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 19 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2004, we granted approximately 3.9 million stock appreciation rights to our employees and directors. For every dollar by which our stock price exceeds $22.00, we will recognize an expense of approximately $3 million. At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2004, we had $1,970 million and $996 million, respectively of debt and preferred stock. This has had an impact on our annual interest and dividend costs. We will need to comply with certification requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as of December 31, 2005, and we expect to incur increased expenses to comply with these requirements. Regulation Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some of our businesses, such as individual medical products, our revenues and net income will be affected by our ability to get regulatory approval for rate increases. Where rate increases are unacceptable to us, we could withdraw from a state but may for a limited period of time be required to participate in state sponsored risk pools for our former insureds who cannot get replacement policies. For other factors affecting our results of operations or financial condition, see Risk Factors. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following material dispositions, including: On May 3, 2004, we sold the assets of our WorkAbility division of CORE, Inc. (CORE). We recorded a pre tax loss on the sale of $9 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. 52 Table of Contents On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership in Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP) to NHP Holding LLC. We recorded pre tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. Critical Accounting Estimates There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Reserves for the sensitivity analysis of our significant critical accounting estimates. Premiums Short Duration Contracts Our short duration contracts are those on which we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term. Our short duration contracts primarily include: group term life, group disability, group medical and group dental, property and warranty, credit life and disability and extended service contracts and individual medical contracts issued after 2002 in most jurisdictions. Long Duration Contracts Currently, our long duration contracts being sold are pre funded funeral life insurance and investment type annuities. For pre funded funeral life insurance policies, any excess of the gross premium over the net premium is deferred and is recognized in income in a constant relationship with the insurance in force. For pre funded funeral investment type annuity contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and traditional life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from policyholders. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively. Reinsurance Assumed Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates which are based on both payments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Fee Income We primarily derive income from fees received from providing administration services. Fee income is earned when services are performed. 53 Table of Contents Reserves Reserves are established according to GAAP, using generally accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or SAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. Short Duration Contracts For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. For group disability, the case reserves and the IBNR are recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the expected claims future payments. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is reviewed quarterly by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. Group long term disability and group term life reserve adequacy studies are performed annually, and morbidity and mortality assumptions are adjusted where appropriate. Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the unexpired period of the policy. We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for IBNR of $50 million (before reinsurance) and $38.9 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at December 31, 2004. Any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and 54 Table of Contents what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos, environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $2.3 million, $2.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. One of our subsidiaries, ARIC, participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. While the majority of the negotiations, arbitrations and or litigations between the multiple layers of reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries are still ongoing, ARIC and an affiliated company, BICL did resolve disputes with two of its reinsurers in the 1996 and 1997 program years by means of a commutation agreement. As a result of the settlement, the two affiliated reinsurers paid ARIC and BICL $6 million and both parties agreed to release each other from any past, present or future obligations of any kind. Based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that it is not reasonably likely that any liabilities we experience in connection with these programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. Long Duration Contracts Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 or issued in a limited number of jurisdictions and the traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of the future net premiums. These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral investment type annuities, universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, and the variable life insurance and investment type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances. 55 Table of Contents Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded for these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. DAC The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions including the anticipation of interest income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Short Duration Contracts DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability and group dental consist primarily of new business underwriting, field sales support, commissions to agents and brokers, and compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs are front end loaded; thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical contracts consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation to representatives. These contracts are considered short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these costs are not deferred but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and in a limited numbers of juridictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The 56 Table of Contents majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed businesses were written off when the businesses were sold. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Changes in individual security values are regularly monitored in order to identify potential problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost. Each quarter the watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. At this meeting, any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. Other Accounting Policies For a description of other accounting policies applicable to the periods covered by this report, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Significant Accounting Standard Affecting Our Business On January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS 142. As of our adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In addition, we were required to subject our goodwill to an initial impairment test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to conduct impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment event, our net income will be higher as a result of not having to amortize goodwill. As a result of this initial impairment test, we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,261 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 57 Table of Contents principle as of January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. We performed a January 1, 2003 and 2004 impairment test during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 and concluded that goodwill was not further impaired. We also performed a January 1, 2005 impairment test during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and management believes that goodwill will not be impaired. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of additional recent accounting standards that are applicable to us.

See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 58 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $338 million, or 5%, from $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $7,404 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $326 million, or 5%, from $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $6,483 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase of $87 million and $222 million in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in the extended service contract, international, and creditor placed and voluntary homeowners businesses. This growth was offset by a decline in domestic credit insurance and our manufactured housing businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increased sales, which partially reflect the success of HSAs, and increased rates. Net investment income increased by $28 million, or 5%, from $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $635 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased 16 basis points from 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in the average portfolio yield was due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million, or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net realized gains on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we had other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities of $20 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to other investments. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was consistent with the anticipated run off of the business ceded to The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000. See Reinsurance. On May 3, 2004 we sold our WorkAbility division and recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of this business in the second quarter of 2004. Fees and other income decreased by $19 million, or 8%, from $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $213 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $25 million and $9 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and Corporate and Other, respectively, offset by increases of $7 million and $6 million in Assurant Solutions and in Assurant Health, respectively. The decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily driven by lower fee income resulting from the sale of the WorkAbility division. The decrease in Corporate and Other was due to a one time adjustment recorded in third quarter of 2003. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in fees related to growth in extended service contracts and debt deferment businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $62 million, or 1%, from $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $6,868 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $182 million, or 5%, from $3,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $3,840 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases of $37 million, $106 million and $29 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to higher catastrophe 59 Table of Contents losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses from catastrophes, net of reinsurance, of $93 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This was partially offset by improved loss experience in our specialty property business absent the catastrophes. The increase in Assurant Health was consistent with the increase in net earned premiums and other considerations. The increase in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to a reserve reduction in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for the group disability, group life and group dental products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced reserves by $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these estimates. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $142 million, or 5%, from $2,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases of $61 million, $86 million, $10 million and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other, respectively, offset by a decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits of $23 million. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in extended service contract, international and creditor placed homeowners businesses and Sarbanes Oxley related expenses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increased commission expense associated with our individual health businesses. The decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to the sale of the WorkAbility division. The increase in Assurant PreNeed was primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in mix of business to more single pay sales. The increase in Corporate and Other was primarily due to public company costs, including expenses related to our initial and secondary public stock offerings and additional costs related to Sarbanes Oxley. Interest expense increased by $55 million from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was the result of two senior notes that we issued in February 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in January 2004. In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred securities. Net Income Net income increased by $165 million, or 89%, from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $351 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes increased by $111 million, or 150%, from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 28.5% compared to 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2004, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act), we repatriated $110 million of capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately $5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction of our tax liability. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $534 million, or 8%, from $6,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 60 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net earned premiums and other considerations was primarily due to increases of $285 million, $175 million, and $23 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $8 million in Assurant PreNeed. The increase in Assurant Solutions was due to growth in specialty property and consumer protection products. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increases in individual health insurance business due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net investment income decreased by $25 million, or 4%, from $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment yields driven by the lower interest rate environment. The yield on average invested assets was 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.27% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million in the Corporate and Other segment. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. See Reinsurance. Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no disposals in 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 6%, from $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002, associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $222 million, or 6%, from $3,435 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $3,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $144 million, $95 million and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty property products, primarily in creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health insurance business, which was consistent with growth in this business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was 61 Table of Contents primarily due to increases of $141 million, $43 million and $11 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was consistent with growth in the specialty property and consumer protection products business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increases in commissions, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general expenses, which was consistent with the growth in business. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of the preferred securities in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of preferred securities in early January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the preferred securities, we incurred $206 million in interest premiums on redemption for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in 2002. Net Income Net income increased by $1,187 million, or 119%, from a loss of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to a profit of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2003. Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or 33%, from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.5% compared to 29.7% in 2002. Assurant Solutions Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,449 $ 2,362 $ 2,077 Net investment income 185 187 205 Fees and other income 136 129 119 Total revenues 2,770 2,678 2,401 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (936 ) (899 ) (755 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (1,651 ) (1,590 ) (1,449 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,587 ) (2,489 ) (2,204 ) Segment income before income tax 183 189 197 Income taxes (57 ) (56 ) (65 ) Segment income after tax $ 126 $ 133 $ 132 Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Specialty Property Solutions(1) $ 769 $ 733 $ 552 Consumer Protection Solutions(2) 1,680 1,629 1,525 Total $ 2,449 $ 2,362 $ 2,077 62 Table of Contents (1) Specialty Property Solutions includes a variety of specialized property insurance programs that are coupled with differentiated administrative capabilities. (2) Consumer Protection Solutions includes an array of debt protection, administrative services, credit based programs and extended service contracts. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $92 million, or 3%, from $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,770 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $87 million, or 4% from $2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $51 million in net earned premiums and other considerations from our consumer protection solutions products, primarily due to growth in our extended service contract and international businesses, partially offset by the decline of our domestic credit insurance business. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our specialty property solutions products increased by $36 million, primarily from growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance product lines. This growth was partially offset by lower net earned premiums in our manufactured housing business, primarily due to the overall decline in manufactured housing sales. Net investment income decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased by 40 basis points from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 4.78% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Fees and other income increased by $7 million, or 5%, from $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase in fees related to growth in our extended service contracts and our debt deferment businesses. These increases were partially offset by two factors. The year ended December 31, 2003 included fee income of $6 million pertaining to certain non profitable membership programs that were discontinued in the latter part of 2003 and in the first quarter of 2003 we recognized fees for a one time project. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $98 million, or 4%, from $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,587 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $37 million, or 4%, from $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $936 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to higher catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses, net of reinsurance, from catastrophes of $93 million and $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The higher catastrophe losses in 2004 were partially offset by improved loss experience, in our specialty property business absent the catastrophes. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $61 million, or 4%, from $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,651 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $15 million, which is consistent with the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $46 million, primarily due to increased business from our extended service contracts, international, and creditor placed homeowners insurance businesses. Additionally, in 2004 we incurred Sarbanes Oxley related expenses and an increase in guaranty fund assessments attributable to the four hurricanes. 63 Table of Contents Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $7 million, or 5%, from $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes increased by $1 million, or 2%, from $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change in income taxes is consistent with the change in pretax income and reflects a change in the mix of international and domestic taxable income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $277 million, or 12%, from $2,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $285 million, or 14%, from $2,077 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $181 million of additional net earned premiums and other considerations attributable to our special property products, primarily due to our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners insurance lines of business generated from new clients and increased sales growth from our existing clients. Consumer protection products also contributed $104 million in net earned premiums and other considerations primarily from growth in our warranty and extended service contracts business. Net investment income decreased by $18 million, or 9%, from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The average portfolio yield dropped 67 basis points from 5.85% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 3%. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 8%, from $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the continuing transition of our credit insurance business to our debt protection administration business. We also recognized fees for a one time project in the first quarter of 2003 of $2.9 million. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $144 million, or 19%, from $755 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our specialty property products accounted for $112 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business and approximately $18 million of the increase was attributable to various catastrophes ($30 million in 2003 compared to $12 million in 2002). Our consumer protection products also contributed $32 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our warranty and extended service contracts line of business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling and underwriting expenses, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $116 million, which consisted of $45 million primarily from our specialty property products due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of the increase was from our consumer protection products due to increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract lines of business. General expenses increased by $25 million, primarily from start up costs related to setting up new clients in the creditor placed homeowners insurance area and increased business from our warranty and extended service contract products. 64 Table of Contents Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $1 million, or 1%, from $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the decrease in investment income of $13 million after tax, segment income after tax increased by $14 million, or 11%. Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or 14%, from $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in 2003. Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions except membership data) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,231 $ 2,009 $ 1,834 Net investment income 68 49 55 Fees and other income 39 33 23 Total revenues 2,338 2,091 1,912 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (1,423 ) (1,317 ) (1,222 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (675 ) (589 ) (546 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,098 ) (1,906 ) (1,768 ) Segment income before income tax 240 185 144 Income taxes (82 ) (64 ) (49 ) Segment income after tax $ 158 $ 121 $ 95 Loss ratio(1) 63.8 % 65.6 % 66.6 % Expense ratio(2) 29.7 % 28.9 % 29.4 % Combined ratio(3) 92.4 % 93.3 % 95.2 % Membership by product line (in thousands): Individual 782 761 670 Small employer group 333 376 355 Total 1,115 1,137 1,025 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $222 million, or 11%, from $2,009 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2,231 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premium growth in individual health insurance business was attributable to continued sales which partially reflect the success of the HSAs that were introduced on January 1, 2004, and premium rate increases. Net earned premium growth in our small employer group health insurance business was attributable to premium rate increases partially offset by decreases in membership. Net investment income increased by $19 million, or 39%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased by 8 basis points from 5.55% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 5.47% for the year ended December 31. 2004, due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 39% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Fees and other income increased by $6 million, or 18%, from $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets, such as sales of our non insurance health access discount cards. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $192 million, or 10%, from $1,906 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $106 million, or 8%, from $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,423 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss ratio improved 180 basis points from 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004. This improvement was attributable to favorable loss experience predominantly on individual health insurance business, as well as a higher mix of individual health insurance business compared to small employer group health insurance business in 2004. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $86 million, or 15%, from $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $675 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The expense ratio increased by 80 basis points from 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. These increases were primarily related to increased commission expense on first year individual health insurance business and additional spending on initiatives to improve our product offerings, distribution, customer service, and infrastructure. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $37 million, or 31%, from $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes increased by $18 million, or 28%, from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to the increase in pre tax income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 9.0%, from $1,912 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 66 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $175 million, or 10%, from $1,834 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,009 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums attributable to our individual health insurance business increased $156 million due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group health insurance business increased $19 million primarily because we instituted premium rate increases in select small group markets to sufficiently price for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for anticipated future medical trends. Net investment income decreased by $6 million, or 11%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 88 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.55% for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the lower interest rate environment. Offsetting the decrease in yield was a 4% increase in average invested assets for the year ended December 31, 2003, over the comparable prior year period. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 43%, from $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets, such as sales of our non insurance health access discount cards. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $138 million, or 8%, from $1,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,906 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $95 million, or 8%, from $1,222 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was consistent with the increase in net earned premiums and other considerations. The loss ratio improved 100 basis points from 66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to our risk management activities. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $43 million, or 8%, from $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Commissions increased by $33 million corresponding to an increase in first year net earned premiums over the prior year. Taxes, licenses and fees decreased by $6 million due to reduced premium tax rates on a portion of the medical premium. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $7 million due to higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General expenses increased by $9 million mainly due to additional spending to improve claims experience. The expense ratio improved 50 basis points from 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $26 million, or 27%, from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income taxes increased by $15 million, or 31%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 27% increase in segment income before income tax during the year ended December 31, 2003. 67 Table of Contents Assurant Employee Benefits Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee Benefits segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,277 $ 1,256 $ 1,233 Net investment income 150 140 148 Fees and other income 29 54 74 Total revenues 1,456 1,450 1,455 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (950 ) (921 ) (945 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (410 ) (433 ) (422 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,360 ) (1,354 ) (1,367 ) Segment income before income tax 96 96 88 Income taxes (34 ) (34 ) (31 ) Segment income after tax $ 62 $ 62 $ 57 Loss ratio(1) 74.4 % 73.3 % 76.6 % Expense ratio(2) 31.4 % 33.1 % 32.3 % Premium persistency ratio(3) 81.1 % 79.9 % 79.9 % Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Group dental $ 521 $ 539 $ 554 Group disability 506 461 400 Group life 250 256 279 Total $ 1,277 $ 1,256 $ 1,233 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

(3) The premium persistency ratio is equal to the rate at which existing business for all issue years at the beginning of the period remains in force at the end of the period. The calculation for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes DBD. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, from $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,456 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $21 million, or 2%, from $1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,277 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premium growth was driven by our disability business. Group disability net earned premiums increased by 68 Table of Contents $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in business written through alternate distribution sources, as well as the transition of a block of business from administrative fee only business to fully insured business. The increase in group disability net earned premiums was partially offset by decreases in group dental and group life net earned premiums and other considerations. Group Dental net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. We are maintaining pricing discipline in an increasingly competitive market, which has resulted in lower sales and renewals. Group life net earned premiums decreased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business during 2003. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 81.1% for 2004, an increase of 120 basis points from 2003. Net investment income increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield declined 17 basis points from 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 6.22% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 10% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December, 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $25 million, or 46%, from $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee income resulting from the sale of the WorkAbility division, as well as the transition of a block of business from administrative fee only business to fully insured business. See Corporate and Other. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, from $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,360 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $29 million, or 3%, from $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $950 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss ratio increased by 110 basis points from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 74.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. These year over year increases were primarily driven by a reduction in reserves in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for group disability, group life, and group dental products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced reserves by $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these estimates. Also contributing to the increase in 2004 was poor experience on a single large disability case and deterioration in group dental experience, partially offset by lower group disability incidence and improved group life mortality experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $23 million or 5% from $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $410 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The expense ratio decreased by 170 basis points from 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by the sale of the WorkAbility division noted earlier, as well as the writedown of previously capitalized software in 2003, not incurred in 2004. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 was $62 million. Income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 were $34 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less than 1%, from $1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 69 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in disability net earned premium of $61 million was primarily due to additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS. Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition, dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven by lower sales and the non renewal of a large account. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003, which was unchanged from 2002. Net investment income decreased by $8 million, or 5%, from $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 77 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.16% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. Average invested assets increased by 6% from 2002 to 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $20 million, or 27%, from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee revenue from CORE due to the sale of PRA. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by $13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits decreased by $24 million, or 3%, from $945 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was driven by favorable development in disability claims and lower claim volume due to the reduction in dental and group life net earned premiums. In addition, during the third quarter of 2003, we completed reserve studies for the group disability, group life, and group dental products, which concluded that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant. Adjustments were made to reserves to reflect current mortality and morbidity experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million. The benefits loss ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in 2003. Excluding the reserve release discussed above, the benefits loss ratio improvement was driven primarily by favorable disability experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio increased from 32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to a $6.2 million writedown of previously capitalized software related to our new administration system. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $5 million, or 9%, from $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income tax expense increased by $3 million, or 10%, from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 9% increase in segment income before tax. 70 Table of Contents Assurant PreNeed Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant PreNeeds segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 526 $ 530 $ 538 Net investment income 206 188 184 Fees and other income 7 5 5 Total revenues 739 723 727 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (531 ) (521 ) (513 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (157 ) (147 ) (137 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (688 ) (668 ) (650 ) Segment income before income tax 51 55 77 Income taxes (17 ) (19 ) (27 ) Segment income after tax $ 34 $ 36 $ 50 Net earned premiums and other considerations by channel: AMLIC $ 273 $ 283 $ 293 Independent 253 247 245 Total $ 526 $ 530 $ 538 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $16 million, or 2%, from $723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $739 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $4 million, or less than 1%, from $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $526 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a 3.6% decline in new sales as a result of our decision to make pricing changes on certain new business as well as a decrease in renewal premiums in the AMLIC channel. These were partially offset by the change in the mix of business from limited pay to single pay sales in the independent channel. Net investment income increased by $18 million, or 10%, from $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased 23 basis points from 6.57% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 6.34% for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 14% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from the year ended December 31, 2003. Fees and other income increased by $2 million, or 40% from $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reason for this increase is $1 million of income related to a derivative instrument, the CPI cap. 71 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $20 million, or 3%, from $668 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $688 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $10 million, or 2%, from $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $531 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a larger in force block of business as well as an increase of $5 million over 2003 related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in growth rates on the discretionary growth business which reduced policyholder benefits by $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in mix of business to more single pay sales. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $2 million, or 6%, from $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 11%, from $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $4 million, or 1%, from $727 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $8 million, or 2%, from $538 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel which was caused by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI, AMLICs principal customer. Net investment income increased by $4 million, or 2%, from $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. A 8% increase in average invested assets was offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the annualized investment yield, which was 6.91% at December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at December 31, 2003. The increase in average invested assets was due to a larger in force block of business. The rate decline reduced net investment income by $10 million over the comparable prior year period. The decline in yields was due to the lower interest rate environment and the restructuring of the portfolio in 2002 to improve credit quality. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $18 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $668 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $8 million, or 2%, from $513 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was due to the increase in business written and other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies use a CPI rate credited on policies. The CPI rate increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition, benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. 72 Table of Contents Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and VOBA expense increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force block of business. Overall general operating expenses before deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable prior year period due to expense control. This reduction includes a $0.7 million charge associated with restructuring of the sales force in our independent division. Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the prior year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $14 million, or 28%, from $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was caused primarily by smaller spreads between investment income earned and the fixed benefits credited to policyholders, increased growth credited on the CPI block of business and higher utilization of the early pay off feature. Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or 30%, from $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment income before tax. Corporate and Other Overview The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of the FFG and LTC businesses. The table below presents information regarding Corporate and Others segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ $ $ Net investment income 26 43 40 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 24 2 (118 ) Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 58 68 80 Gain (loss) on disposal of businesses (9 ) 11 Fees and other income 2 11 25 Total revenues 101 124 38 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits Selling, underwriting and general expenses (77 ) (69 ) (55 ) Interest expense (56 ) (1 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2 ) (113 ) (118 ) Premium on redemption of preferred securities (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (135 ) (389 ) (173 ) Segment (loss) before income tax (34 ) (265 ) (135 ) Income taxes 5 99 61 Segment (loss) after tax $ (29 ) $ (166 ) $ (74 ) 73 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $330 million (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $23 million, or 19%, from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net investment income decreased by $17 million, or 40%, from $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 mainly due to the lower interest rate environment and the decrease in average invested assets. Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million, or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net realized gains on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we had other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities of $20 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to other investments. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was consistent with the anticipated run off of the business ceded to The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000. On May 3, 2004, we sold our WorkAbility division and recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of business in the second quarter of 2004. Fees and other income decreased by $9 million, or 82%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to a one time adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2003. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $254 million, or 65%, from $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $8 million, or 12%, from $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to $25 million of public company costs in 2004, including expenses related to our initial and secondary public stock offerings and additional costs related to Sarbanes Oxley. In 2003, we incurred $14 million of public company costs, including expenses related to our initial public offering. Interest expense increased by $55 million from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was the result of the two senior notes that we issued in February 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in January 2004. 74 Table of Contents In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred securities. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after income tax improved by $137 million, or 83%, from $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income tax benefit decreased by $94 million, or 95%, from an income tax benefit of $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to an income tax benefit of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. Also, in December 2004, pursuant to the Jobs Act, we repatriated $110 million of capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately $5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction of our tax liability. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $86 million, or 226%, from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net investment income increased by $3 million, or 8%, from $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $20 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. See Reinsurance. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 56%, from $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in 2002 associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 75 Table of Contents Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $14 million of consulting and compensation expenses incurred in 2003, related to our initial public offering in February 2004. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities we incurred $206 million of interest premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero recognized in 2002. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $92 million, or 124%, from $74 million in 2002 to $166 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to the $206 million of interest premiums incurred related to early extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, partially offset by the favorable $120 million change in net realized capital gains (losses) on investments. Income tax benefit increased by $38 million, or 62%, from $61 million in 2002 to $99 million in 2003. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Fixed maturities $ 9,178 76 % $ 8,729 77 % $ 8,036 77 % Equity securities 527 4 456 4 272 3 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1,054 9 933 8 842 8 Policy loans 65 1 68 1 69 1 Short term investments 300 2 276 2 684 7 Collateral head under securities lending 535 4 420 4 377 3 Other investments 489 4 462 4 181 1 Total investments $ 12,148 100 % $ 11,344 100 % $ 10,461 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 67% and 70% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. As interest rates increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities decreases. 76 Table of Contents The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (pre tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,680 $ 8,230 $ 7,631 Net unrealized gains 498 499 405 Fair value $ 9,178 $ 8,729 $ 8,036 Equities: Cost $ 513 $ 437 $ 265 Net unrealized gains 14 19 7 Fair value $ 527 $ 456 $ 272 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased by $1 million, or less than 1%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $5 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004. The decrease in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the net effect of the change in treasury yields. The 10 year treasury yield decreased 3 basis points between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 and the 5 year treasury yield increased 36 basis points between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $94 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $12 million, or 171%, from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003. The increase in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the decline in investment grade corporate securities yield spreads combined with an increase in treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade corporate securities fell by approximately 119 basis points while yields on 10 year treasury securities increased by 44 basis points between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. We recorded $0.6 million, $20 million, and $85.3 million of pre tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, associated with other than temporary declines in value of available for sale securities. We also recorded $4.2 million, $11 million, and zero of pre tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, associated with other investments. The investment category and duration of our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at December 31, 2004 were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fixed maturities Bonds: United States Government and government agencies and authorities $ 303 $ (3 ) $ 44 $ (1 ) $ 347 $ (4 ) States, municipalities and political subdivisions 21 1 22 Foreign governments 54 25 (1 ) 79 (1 ) Public utilities 92 (1 ) 3 95 (1 ) All other corporate bonds 553 (6 ) 39 (1 ) 592 (7 ) Total fixed maturities $ 1,023 $ (10 ) $ 112 $ (3 ) $ 1,135 $ (13 ) Equity securities Non redeemable preferred stocks: Non sinking fund preferred stocks $ 88 $ (2 ) $ 7 $ (1 ) $ 95 $ (3 ) Total equity securities $ 88 $ (2 ) $ 7 $ (1 ) $ 95 $ (3 ) 77 Table of Contents The total unrealized losses represent less than 1% of the aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately 77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 474 individual securities with 92% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $0.1 million. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for longer than six months but less than 12 months was approximately $7.9 million, with no security with a book value of greater than $1.0 million having a market value below 86% of book value. As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and concluded that there were no additional other than temporary impairments for the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased. Reserves The following table presents reserve information as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Future policy benefits and expenses $ 6,413 $ 6,235 $ 5,807 Unearned premiums 3,354 3,134 3,208 Claims and benefits payable 3,615 3,472 3,374 Total policy liabilities $ 13,382 $ 12,841 $ 12,389 Future policy benefits and expenses increased by $178 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $428 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. Unearned premiums increased by $220 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and decreased by $74 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to the increase from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 was new extended service contract business assumed in late 2003. The decrease from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 was primarily driven by the run off of our domestic credit insurance contracts, offset by growth in other short duration contracts. Claims and benefits payable increased by $143 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $98 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. 78 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 Future Future Policy Claims and Policy Claims and Benefits and Unearned Benefits Benefits and Unearned Benefits Expenses Premiums Payable Expenses Premiums Payable (In millions) Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 2,684 $ 3 $ 14 $ 2,276 $ 3 $ 14 Life insurance no longer offered 525 1 2 688 1 4 Universal life and annuities no longer offered 320 1 12 322 1 17 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,694 48 216 2,744 48 177 All other 190 53 123 205 57 151 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 10 393 13 394 Group disability 4 1,446 4 1,375 Medical 100 349 67 266 Dental 6 35 7 39 Property and warranty 1,105 597 1,149 580 Credit life and disability 655 359 759 403 Extended service contracts 1,347 38 1,023 18 All other 21 31 2 34 Total policy liabilities $ 6,413 $ 3,354 $ 3,615 $ 6,235 $ 3,134 $ 3,472 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Long Duration The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. Historically, loss recognition testing has not resulted in an adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated. 79 Table of Contents Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $50.0 million higher (or $47.7 million lower). If claim termination rates were 10% lower (or higher) than currently assumed, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $33.9 million higher (or $31.7 million lower). The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $12.0 million higher (or $11.3 million lower). As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Group Disability incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $12 million less, $53 million more, and $3 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Group Disability reserves are long term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003, and its related upward revision, reflects the result of reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based on results of those studies, reserves were increased by $44 million, almost all of which was attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to reflect current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability reserve redundancies in 2002 and 2004, which were less than 1% of prior year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning of year case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year case reserves. The difference in actual versus best estimate recovery rates reflects an experience gain, which is recognized in the period the gain is realized. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Group Term Life incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $36 million, $93 million, and $29 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A significant portion of the Group Term Life reserve is related to waiver of premium reserves for disabled claimants. Group Term Life waiver of premium reserves are long term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. Group Term Life reserves were reduced in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect the results of reserve adequacy studies conducted. Based on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by $59 million. The 80 Table of Contents change in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested assets and recent mortality and recovery experience. Another portion of the Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years described above was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our beginning of year reserves and recovery rates being higher than assumed in our beginning of year wavier of premium reserves. The remaining redundancy was due to shorter than expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid claim dates. These adjustments were made to reflect current yields on invested assets, and recent mortality and recovery experience. These changes were offset by one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year waiver of premium reserves. The differences in actual versus best estimate mortality, recovery and paid claim lag rates reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. The conclusion of the 2003 reserve studies determined that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million, which included $3 million of reserve release relating to the group dental business. Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss development factors for the most recent four months would result in approximately $18 million higher (or $14 million lower) reserves at December 31, 2004. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 80% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our Medical business related to prior years were $50 million, $58 million, and $43 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the short tail nature of this business, these developments related to claims incurred in the preceding year (i.e., in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively). The redundancies in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical reserve estimates, were caused by our claims developing more favorably than expected. Our actual claims experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and lower medical inflation than assumed in our prior year pricing and reserving processes. The differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates, medical provider utilization and medical inflation reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus 81 Table of Contents case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate is selected from the middle to upper end of the third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our property and warranty lines of business related to prior years were $25 million less, $13 million less, and $2 million more than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys property and warranty lines of business had a small deficiency in 2002 which was largely attributable to a shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional development on the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, contributing to a modest redundancy. In 2004, an improved economic environment led to lower unemployment levels, which meant that loss payments on existing claims as well as payments on new claims in our credit unemployment lines, were not as high as would have been expected. This, coupled with lower reserve levels as a result of reduced premium writings in this line, lead to a redundancy. These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual claim frequencies differing from best estimate claim frequencies, and difference in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the periods they emerge. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in the results of operations. Reinsurance The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Reinsurance recoverables $ 4,133 $ 4,377 $ 4,650 Reinsurance recoverables decreased by $244 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $273 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,389 million, $2,410 million, and $2,255 million at December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 (In millions) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,504 $ 2,551 Ceded unearned premium 767 971 Ceded claims and benefits payable 720 747 Ceded paid losses 142 108 Total $ 4,133 $ 4,377 We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing. 82 Table of Contents Based on our December 31, 2004 results, we anticipate that we will receive approximately $34 million from reinsurers in respect of the 2004 Florida hurricanes. Our benefits, losses and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect this anticipated recovery. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases to facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal entities with business segments that we retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still reflected in our balance sheet. The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was $1,507 million and $1,537 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was $882 million and $873 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We would be responsible for administering this business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a default by reinsurers. In addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to increase the value of the separate account assets relating to modified guaranteed annuity business sold if such value declines below the value of the associated liabilities. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make these payments. Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form 83 Table of Contents of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2004, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was $302 million. For a discussion of the various restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, please see Item 1 Business Regulation and Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, and $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend payments to our stockholders. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. In December 2003, we entered into two senior bridge credit facilities of $650 million and $1,100 million. The aggregate indebtedness of $1,750 million under the facility was in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. On January 30, 2004, we entered into a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are not in default. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. As of December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. On February 10, 2004, we received a $725.5 million capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. The proceeds from that contribution were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the $650 million senior bridge credit facility and $75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition, we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our $975 million senior note offerings described below. All amounts outstanding under our senior bridge credit facilities were paid off in 2004. On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975 million. The first series is $500 million in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is 84 Table of Contents payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. In March 2004, we established a $500 million commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. On June 1, 2004, August 9, 2004 and October 18, 2004, we used $20 million, $40 million and $40 million, respectively, from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, which was repaid on June 15, 2004, August 20, 2004 and October 29, 2004, respectively. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at December 31, 2004. We did not use the revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and no amounts are currently outstanding. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay the remaining portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our $1,100 million senior bridge facility. Our qualified pension plan was under funded by $57.4 million at December 31, 2004. We established a funding policy in which service cost plus 15% of plan deficit will be contributed annually. In the full year 2004, we made contributions to the pension fund totaling $26 million. This funding policy will be revised annually to take into effect any assumption changes, return on plan assets and funded status of the plan. In accordance with ERISA, there is no expected minimum funding requirement for 2004 or 2005. Our nonqualified plan, which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of $85.2 million at December 31, 2004. The expected Company payments to retirees under this plan are approximately $4 million per year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our post retirement plans (other than pension), which are partially funded with $7 million of assets, had an accumulated post retirement benefit obligation of $54.5 million at December 31, 2004. In the full year 2004, we contributed $5.7 million towards pre funding these benefits. In addition, the expected Company payments to retirees and dependents under the postretirement plan are approximately $1.2 million per year in 2004 and 2005. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our name change and rebranding initiative have been approximately $10 million, which were expensed in 2004. We are not currently planning to make any other significant capital expenditures in 2005. During January 2004, we paid to participants in the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of $25 million in connection with the cash out of all outstanding Fortis incentive rights. In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. 85 Table of Contents The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 834 $ 741 $ 364 Investing activities (644 ) (711 ) (379 ) Financing activities (341 ) 318 (43 ) Net change in cash $ (151 ) $ 348 $ (58 ) Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The key changes of the net cash outflow of $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,238 million, maturities of these securities of $851 million, repayment of debt in the amount of $1,750 million, issuance of debt of $972 million, and issuance of common stock of $725 million. The key changes of the net cash inflow of $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,929 million, maturities of these securities of $1,131 million and issuance of debt in the amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,164 million and maturities of these securities of $858 million. At December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $996 million, as compared to $1,970 million at December 31, 2003 and $1,471 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, this debt consisted of $972 million of senior notes and $24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, Security 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and interest paid $ 38 $ 129 $ 117 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends 1 1 1 Common stock dividends 30 181 42 Total $ 69 $ 311 $ 160 86 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2004, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Contractual obligations: Insurance liabilities(1) $ 1,515 $ 637 $ 256 $ 991 $ 3,399 Debt 975 975 Interest on debt 60 181 181 762 1,184 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 24 24 Operating leases 35 52 37 28 152 Commitments: Investment purchases Outstanding: unsettled trades 35 35 commercial mortgage loans on real estate 32 32 other investments 24 5 29 Total obligations and commitments $ 1,701 $ 875 $ 474 $ 2,780 $ 5,830 (1) Insurance liabilities, reflected in the commitments and contingencies table above, include products for which we are currently making periodic payments and products for which we are not making periodic payments, but for which we believe the amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and determinable. Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The total amount represents the claims and benefits payable on all of our long and short duration contracts with the exception of $216 million related to our FFG and LTC disposed businesses. The payment of these liabilities has been fully reinsured. See Item 1 Business Business Dispositions. Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of $6,413 million and unearned premiums of $3,354 million as of December 31, 2004 have been excluded from the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above because the determination of these liability amounts and the timing of payments are not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event, payment triggering or revenue recognition event has not yet occurred. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan liability was $49 million. This liability will be paid based on the plan description. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $66 million and $117 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. 87 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Company Our profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business. Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties with which we do business are important to the success of our business segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with several mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers and other financial institutions through which we distribute our products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution relationships for our individual health insurance products with IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), and USAA, as well as a relationship with HAA, the association through which we provide many of our individual health insurance products through Assurant Healths agreement dated September 1, 2003 with its administrator, NAC. An association in the health insurance market is an entity formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance and does not make health insurance coverage offered through the association available other than in connection with membership in the association. The agreement that provides for our exclusive distribution relationship with IPSI terminates in June 2008, but may be extended if agreed to by both parties. We also maintain contractual relationships with several separate networks of health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. A PPO is an entity that acts as an intermediary between an insurer and a network of hospitals, physicians, dentists or other providers of health care who have agreed to provide care to insureds subject to contractually established reimbursement rates. In Assurant PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one to five years. Although we believe we have generally been successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to terminate these arrangements or seek to renew these contracts on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services, which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with PPOs could also lead to higher medical or dental costs and or a loss of members to other medical or dental plans. For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few clients over the last three years as a result of bankruptcies and termination of contracts either by it or its clients; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. At Assurant Health, client turnover has been stable over the last three years as none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Assurant PreNeed terminated several client relationships with three funeral home groups in 2003 because of profitability issues with the business; none of the clients terminated was significant to its business. Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or develop and maintain distribution sources. We distribute our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels including: independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life agents, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, funeral directors, association groups and other third party marketing organizations. Our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. We do not distribute our insurance products and services through captive or affiliated agents. In Assurant Health, we depend in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on associations, including HAA, in the marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our customers, market and distribute our products. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us and usually also market products of our competitors. Strong competition exists 88 Table of Contents among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales representatives, agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. In addition, by relying on independent agents and brokers to distribute products for us, we face continued competition from our competitors products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory environment. Recently, the marketing of health insurance through association groups and broker compensation arrangements have come under increased scrutiny. An interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various third party distributors or our inability to respond to regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have our own sales representatives whose role in the distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. General economic, financial market and political conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions. These conditions include economic cycles such as insurance industry cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer lending, levels of inflation and movements of the financial markets. Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy, demographics, and legislative and competitive factors also influence our performance. During periods of economic downturn: individuals and businesses may choose not to purchase our insurance products and other related products and services, may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased or, in Assurant Employee Benefits and in small group employer health insurance in Assurant Health, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to rising unemployment levels; new disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise; there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment levels; and insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits. In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our pre funded funeral insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. Pre funded funeral insurance provides benefits to fund the costs incurred in connection with a pre arranged funeral contract, which is an arrangement between a funeral firm and an individual whereby the funeral firm agrees to perform a selected funeral upon the individuals death. Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and capital. We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims IBNR as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or SAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts 89 Table of Contents and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. However, future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss limitation methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and property coverages. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Utilization review is a review process designed to control and limit medical expenses, which includes, among other things, requiring certification for admission to a health care facility and cost effective ways of handling patients with catastrophic illnesses. Claims management entails the use of a variety of means to mitigate the extent of losses incurred by insureds and the corresponding benefit cost, which includes efforts to improve the quality of medical care provided to insureds and to assist them with vocational services. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by: changes in health and dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments. The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes, by insurance regulations, existing contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions or other factors. Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales and profitability. Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses that could reduce our profitability. Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant fluctuations in the fixed income market could impair our profitability, financial condition and or cash flows. Our investments are 90 Table of Contents subject to market wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In particular, volatility of claims may force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net investment income was $635 million and our net realized gains on investments were $24 million, which collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues during such period. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our net investment income was $607 million and our net realized gains on investments were $2 million, which collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues during such period. The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions. Changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments, which comprised $9,478 million, or 82%, of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2004 and $9,005 million, or 82%, as of December 31, 2003. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates, and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. As of December 31, 2004, mortgage backed and other asset backed securities represented approximately $1,677 million, or 14%, of the fair value of our total investments. Because substantially all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of these securities are reflected in our balance sheet. Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We employ asset/ liability matching strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. Our asset/ liability matching strategies include: asset/ liability duration management, structuring our bond and commercial mortgage loan portfolios to limit the effects of prepayments and consistent monitoring of, and appropriate changes to, the pricing of our products. However, these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and no assurances can be given that significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. Whole life insurance refers to a form of life insurance that provides guaranteed death benefits and guaranteed cash values to policyholders. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 83% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves related to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the CPI. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings or a negative spread. As a result, declining interest rates or 91 Table of Contents high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on current interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. Waiver of premium refers to a provision in a life insurance policy pursuant to which an insured with total disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to pay premiums for the duration of the disability or for a stated period, during which time the life insurance coverage provides continued coverage. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and or new claims would need to be calculated using lower discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates. Our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk. We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and preferred stocks. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in investment losses. Further, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer. As of December 31, 2004, we held $9,178 million of fixed maturity securities, or 76% of the fair value of our total invested assets at such date. Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities, which comprised 6% of the fair value of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. These investments generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Other than temporary impairment losses on our available for sale securities totaled $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, less than 1% of the fair value of our total investments was invested in common stock; however, we have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such investments in the future. Investments in common stock generally provide higher expected total returns, but present greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed income investments. In addition, while currently we do not utilize derivative instruments to hedge or manage our interest rate or equity risk, we may do so in the future. Derivative instruments generally present greater risk than fixed income investments or equity investments because of their greater sensitivity to market fluctuations. Effective as of August 1, 2003, we utilize derivative instruments in managing Assurant PreNeeds exposure to inflation risk. While these instruments seek to protect a portion of Assurant PreNeeds existing business that is tied to the CPI, a sharp increase in inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments subject us to liquidity risk. As of December 31, 2004, commercial mortgage loans on real estate investments represented approximately 9% of the fair value of our total investments. These types of investments are relatively illiquid, thus increasing our liquidity risk. In addition, if we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both. The risk parameters of our investment portfolio may not target an appropriate level of risk, thereby reducing our profitability and diminishing our ability to compete and grow. We seek to earn returns on our investments to enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to our customers. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each of our business segments. However, we may not succeed in targeting an appropriate overall risk level for our investment portfolio. As a result, the return on our investments may be insufficient to 92 Table of Contents meet our profit targets over the long term, thereby reducing our profitability. If, in response, we choose to increase our product prices to maintain profitability, we may diminish our ability to compete and grow. Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments. Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition, under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us after a loan default. Catastrophe losses, including man made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other personal business lines. We have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics, or can be man made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible that both the frequency and severity of man made catastrophes will increase and that we will not be able to implement exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance for such catastrophes. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal lines coverages, which for the year ended December 31, 2004 represented approximately 26% of our net earned premiums and other consideration in our Assurant Solutions segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 35.6% of the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal lines related to properties located in California, Florida and Texas. As a result of our creditor placed homeowners insurance product, which typically provides coverage against an insureds property being destroyed or damaged by various perils, our concentration in these areas may increase in the future. This is because in our creditor placed homeowners insurance line, we agree to provide homeowners insurance coverage automatically. If other insurers withdraw coverage in these or other states, this may lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our creditor placed homeowners insurance in these areas. Adverse selection refers to the process by which an applicant who believes himself to be uninsurable, or at greater than average risk, seeks to obtain an insurance policy at a standard premium rate. Claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Our ability to write new business also could be affected. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophes in the future. 93 Table of Contents Pre tax catastrophe losses in excess of $1 million (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent years include: total losses of approximately $10 million incurred in 2001 in connection with tropical storm Allison; total losses of approximately $12 million incurred in 2002 in connection with Arizona wildfires, Texas floods and Hurricane Lili; total losses of approximately $30 million incurred in 2003 in connection with various catastrophes caused by windstorms, hailstorms and tornadoes, Hurricane Isabel and the California wildfires; and total losses of approximately $125 million incurred through December 31, 2004 in connection with the four Florida hurricanes. Total reinsurance recoveries related to these events are anticipated to be approximately $34 million. No liquidation in investments was required in connection with these catastrophes as the claims were paid from current cash flow, cash on hand or short term investments. In addition, our group life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care. The mortality rate refers to the relationship of the frequency of deaths of individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time. The morbidity rate refers to the relationship of the incidence of disease or disability contracted by individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time. For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths. Losses due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in Assurant PreNeed the average age of policyholders is in excess of 72 years. This group is more susceptible to epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our successful utilization of catastrophic property and life reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a single event or multiple events, and life and disability reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently widely available. This means that the occurrence of a significant catastrophe could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to the terrorist assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance for man made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity constraints and, to the limited extent available, much more expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results. If we fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect our ability to write future business. As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life, property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay 94 Table of Contents such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have maintained reinsurance on a significant portion of our Assurant Health business, but we will not renew or replace this reinsurance effective as of December 31, 2004 and therefore, we will not be entitled to certain reinsurance recoverables to which we were previously entitled. We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent. We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of the insurance operations of our FFG division to The Hartford. The assets backing the liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust, and the separate accounts relating to the FFG business are still reflected on our balance sheet. Such separate accounts represent assets allocated under certain policies and contracts that are segregated from the general account and other separate accounts. The policyholder or contractholder bears the risk of investments held in a separate account. However, we would be responsible for administering this business in the event of a default by the reinsurer. We do not have the administrative systems and capabilities to process this business today. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to the credit risk of our agents in Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant Solutions. We advance agents commissions as part of our pre funded funeral insurance product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage as opposed to a percentage of the first year premium paid, the formula that is more common in other life insurance markets. There is a one year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. There is a very large producer within Assurant PreNeed and if it were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, we have not had any loss experience with this very large producer to date. In addition, we are subject to the credit risk of the parties with which we contract in Assurant Solutions. If these parties fail to remit payments owed to us or pass on payments they collect on our behalf, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. A further decline in the manufactured housing market may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant decline in both shipments and retail sales in the last six years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased from approximately 350,000 in 1999 to approximately 120,000 (annualized) in 2004, representing a 66% decline. Repossessions are at an all time high, resale values have been significantly reduced and several lenders, dealers, manufacturers and vertically integrated manufactured housing companies have either ceased operations or gone bankrupt. This downturn in the industry is the result of several factors, including excess production, aggressive sales practices, reduced underwriting standards and poor lending practices. As a result of this downturn, the industry has experienced consolidation, with the leaders purchasing the weaker competitors. If these downward trends continue, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 95 Table of Contents The financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moodys, and S&P, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best. Six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moodys and seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P. The ratings reflect A.M. Bests, Moodys, and S&Ps opinions of our subsidiaries financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. The ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moodys, and S&P, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings. All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best have financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A are Excellent) or A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Moodys financial strength rating is A2 (Good) for one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are Good), and A3 (Good) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The S&P financial strength rating is A (Strong) for four of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A are Strong), and A (Strong) for three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. Rating agencies review their ratings periodically and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, or S&P, or placed under surveillance or review with possible negative implications, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could suffer and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to, among other things: the competitive environment in the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. As customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, or S&P, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Contracts representing approximately 22% of Assurant Solutions net earned premiums and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2004 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from A or better to B or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts if the subsidiaries ratings fall below these minimum acceptable levels. Under our ten year marketing agreement with SCI, AMLIC, one of our subsidiaries in the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. In our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments, we do not have any material contracts that permit termination in the case of a ratings downgrade. 96 Table of Contents The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is dependent upon our ability to keep up to date with technological advances. This is particularly important in Assurant Solutions, where our systems, including our ability to keep our systems integrated with those of our clients, are critical to the operation of our business. Our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we have spent approximately $118 million in Assurant Solutions, $81 million in Assurant Health, $67 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information systems. In 2005, we plan to spend for these purposes approximately $126 million in Assurant Solutions, $89 million in Assurant Health, $62 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed. In addition, our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we do not maintain adequate systems we could experience adverse consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers; customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation exposure; or increases in administrative expenses. Our management information, internal control and financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and development to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements of being a public company. Efforts to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act will entail significant expenditure; non compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act may adversely affect us. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE require changes to some of our accounting and corporate governance practices, including the requirement that we issue a report on our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act by December 31, 2005. We expect these new rules and regulations to continue to increase our accounting, legal and other costs, and to make some activities more difficult, time consuming and or costly. In the event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related rules, it may have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, reduction to our profitability and or subject us to fines and penalties. A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health segment is the subject of national and state legislation, including the HIPAA, and certain of the activities conducted by our Assurant Solutions segment are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect such confidential information vary by business segment and may include among other things: training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information; actively monitoring our record 97 Table of Contents retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information and maintaining a clean desk policy aimed at safeguarding certain current information. In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information we could experience adverse consequences, including loss of clients and related revenue, regulatory problems, loss of reputation and client litigation. See Risks Related to Our Industry Cost of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. While our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new insurance ventures have played a significant role in achieving desired market positions in some, but not all, of our businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including among other things: inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that most of our acquisitions have been successful and have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, we did recognize a goodwill impairment of $1,261 million in 2002 related to an earlier acquisition. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder dividends. As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiarys assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary. 98 Table of Contents The payment of dividends to us by any of our operating subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiarys domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior years statutory net income. In some states, the formula is the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us in 2005 without regulatory approval is approximately $364 million. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million through December 31, 2004. We may seek approval of regulators to pay dividends in excess of any amounts that would be permitted without such approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would seek such approval or would obtain such approval. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses. Our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders if we are in default or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default of the credit facilities. Risks Related to Our Industry Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. In addition to the occasional employment related litigation to which businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in, various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to, our insurance and other related business operations. We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to: disputes over coverage or claims adjudication; disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements; disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims; disputes concerning past premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race; disputes relating to customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various business segments; disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions; disputes relating to certain excess of loss programs in the London market; disputes with taxing authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us. The outcome of these actions cannot be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such actions or any litigation would not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In 99 Table of Contents addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies. Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses. Recently, the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current litigation, investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes and the use of inducements to brokers or companies in the sale of group insurance products. In accordance with a long standing and widespread industry practice, we have paid and may continue to pay contingent commissions to insurance brokers and agents, primarily in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. We purchase reinsurance, including but not limited to reinsurance agreements that share risks and profits with certain clients in our Assurant Solutions segment on business produced by these clients. These clients include mortgage lenders and servicers, financial institutions and retailers. We have received inquiries and informational requests from insurance departments in certain states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate. We have conducted an internal review under the supervision of outside counsel to confirm that our employees have not provided inflated or fictitious quotes or used improper inducements in the sale of group insurance products in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. Another focus of regulators has been the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. One of our reinsurers thinks we should have been accounting for premiums ceded to them as a loan instead of as an expense. Management believes that the difference in treatment would be immaterial to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, premiums ceded to this reinsurer were $2.6 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and losses ceded were $10 million, $0, and $0, respectively. We cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation, investigations and regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our business. Given our prominent position in the insurance industry, it is possible that we will become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed against us. Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines and damages, perhaps in material amounts. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by the negative publicity for the insurance industry related to these proceedings, and by any new industry wide regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings. See Item 1 Business Regulation. We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be profitable. In each of our lines of business, we compete with other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line and product, although we have no single competitor who competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate. Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities. Competitors include insurance companies and financial institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors include health insurance companies, HMO and the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include benefits and life insurance companies as well as not for profit Delta Dental plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two pre need life insurance companies with nationwide representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business. 100 Table of Contents Competition in our businesses is based on many factors, including quality of service, product features, price, scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies. We compete not only for business and individual customers, employer and other group customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without being subject to insurance regulations. Credit insurance is insurance issued to cover the life, unemployment or disability of a debtor or borrower for an outstanding loan. Also, as a result of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which was enacted in November 1999, financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our own. This has resulted in new competitors with significant financial resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do, which may lead them to price their products and services lower than we do. In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. For example, several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a substantial market share. In addition, with regard to Assurant Health, organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able to compete effectively in such markets. New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers. The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our results. The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for periods ranging from two to six years. The segments of the insurance markets in which we operate tend not to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality. Periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of underwriting capacity permit more favorable rate levels, consequent fluctuations in underwriting results and the occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these markets. Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the insurer, including competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. This may cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our product prices in order to maintain our market position, because of the adverse effect on profitability of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations of appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other factors affecting the insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 101 Table of Contents The insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results. The nature of the market for the insurance and related products and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting our industries to the possibility of periodic negative publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. We are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; authorizing lines of business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating underwriting limitations; imposing dividend limitations; regulating changes in control; licensing agents and distributors of insurance products; placing limitations on the minimum and maximum size of life insurance contracts; restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets; admitting statutory assets; mandating certain insurance benefits; restricting companies ability to terminate or cancel coverage; requiring companies to provide certain types of coverage; regulating premium rates, including the ability to increase premium rates; approving policy forms; regulating trade and claims practices; imposing privacy requirements; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; restricting certain transactions between affiliates; regulating the content of disclosures to debtors in the credit insurance area; 102 Table of Contents regulating the type, amounts and valuation of investments; mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds; regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents; and restricting contact with consumers, such as the recently created national do not call list, and imposing consumer protection measures. Assurant Health is also required by some jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by insurers. Each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to some risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of individuals. HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning July 1, 1997. See also Risks Related to Our Industry Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The capacity for an insurance companys growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by SAP and procedures, is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies. We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. That type of action could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions; 103 Table of Contents limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impositions of fines, taxes or other penalties for improper licensing, the failure to promptly pay claims, however defined, or other regulatory violations; increased licensing requirements; prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations; new benefit mandates; increased regulation relating to the use of associations and trusts in the sale of individual health insurance; limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and, as a result, manage health care and utilization due to any willing provider legislation, which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement; limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider; and restriction of solicitation of pre funded funeral insurance consumers by funeral board laws. State legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory projects, all of which can affect our operations. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, could significantly impact the insurance industry and us. Federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. In addition, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care issues. The U.S. Congress is considering Patients Bill of Rights legislation, which, if adopted, would permit health plans to be sued in state court for coverage determinations and could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. There recently have been legislative attempts to limit ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. For example, the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, there have been attempts by the NAIC and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in policy forms. The elimination of discretionary clauses could increase our liability under our health insurance policies. New interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would, among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures, require plans to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a national health insurance program. Any of these proposals, if implemented, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Federal changes in 104 Table of Contents Medicare and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have negative implications for the private sector due to cost shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers. State small employer group and individual health insurance market reforms to increase access and affordability could also reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing for risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance policies. In addition, the U.S. Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal incorporation, similar to banks. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the federal government has granted charters in years past to insurance like organizations that are not subject to state insurance regulations, such as risk retention groups. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States Federal Regulation Legislative Developments. Thus, it is hard to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or on us. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. In addition, the insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements. See Item 1 Business Regulation. It is difficult to predict the effect of the current investigations in connection with insurance industry practices. See Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The privacy of individuals has been the subject of recent state and federal legislation. State privacy laws, particularly those with opt in clauses, can affect the pre funded funeral insurance business and Solutions business. These laws make it harder to share information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created do not call list would restrict our ability to contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our expectations for growth in our direct marketed consumer credit insurance products in the United States. HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have thus far been adopted impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of the required transactions or that other entities with which we interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims. HIPAA is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties. In addition, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of the insurance policy and annually thereafter. Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements. However, certain state laws may require individuals to opt in 105 Table of Contents to information sharing instead of being immediately included. This could significantly increase costs of doing business. Additionally, when final U.S. Treasury Department regulations are promulgated in connection with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to expend additional resources to tailor our existing anti fraud efforts to the new rules. Risks Related to Our Relationship with Fortis Fortis will continue to have representation on our board of directors and influence our affairs for as long as it remains a significant stockholder. As of March 4, 2005, Fortis owned 22,999,130 shares, or approximately 16%, of our outstanding common stock. We have entered into a shareholders agreement with Fortis pursuant to which Fortis has the right to nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, two designees (out of a maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our board of directors. However, we agreed with Fortis to terminate the shareholders agreement effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate governance arrangements will come into effect. These arrangements include that, if at any time while there are no vacancies on our 12 member board of directors, our board of directors, or a committee thereof, adopts a resolution (i) recommending to our shareholders that a particular candidate be elected to our board of directors to replace one of the Fortis designees or (ii) appointing to our board of directors a new member, then Fortis will cause one of the Fortis designees to resign from our board of directors promptly following the adoption of such resolution. In addition, if at any time Fortis ceases to own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, Fortis will promptly cause any remaining Fortis designees to resign from our board of directors. See Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for additional information on related party transactions between our Company and Fortis. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that for so long as Fortis continues to own less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, our board of directors will consist of no more than 12 directors (including at least seven independent directors). Pursuant to our shareholders agreement with Fortis, Fortis has the right to nominate two designees to our board of directors (out of a maximum of 12 directors), and the shareholders agreement and our by laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees. However, we agreed with Fortis to terminate the shareholders agreement effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate governance arrangements will come into effect. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Corporate Governance Arrangements. Fortis sale of the exchangeable bonds concurrently with the closing of the secondary offering will not affect Fortis board rights unless the exchangeable bonds are exchanged for shares of our common stock. The exchangeable bonds and the 22,999,130 shares of Assurant common stock into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 106 Table of Contents Because Fortis will control us, conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could arise which may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us, including, but not limited to, the following areas: Stock Ownership. Our shareholders agreement provides that for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, the following actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis, as stockholder: any recapitalization, reclassification, spin off or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries; or any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to us or our subsidiaries. For more information regarding the shareholders agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Shareholders Agreement. However, under our new corporate governance arrangements with Fortis, which became effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, we will no longer be required to obtain Fortis approval for such corporate actions, but Fortis will agree to vote its shares of our common stock in favor of any such corporate action if, at any time while at least one Fortis designee remains on our board of directors, our board of directors, including any Fortis designee, votes in favor of such corporate action. For more information regarding these matters, see Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. The exchangeable bonds and the shares of Assurant common stock into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Cross Directorships. Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are directors of our Company who are also currently directors and or officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group. Service as both a director of our Company and as a director or officer of Fortis or the Fortis Group or ownership interests of directors or officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis Group could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. Our directors who are also directors or officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group will have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For example, these decisions could relate to: disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition or disposition opportunity; or corporate finance decisions. Allocation of Business Opportunities. Although we do not expect Fortis Group to compete with us in the near term, there may be business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis Group and us. Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to Fortis and we may have no recourse against the Fortis designees or the Fortis Group. We have no formal mechanisms for allocating business opportunities. Because Fortis Bank operates U.S. branch offices, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. Fortis Bank S.A./N.V. (Fortis Bank), which is a company in the Fortis Group, obtained approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) to establish branch offices in Connecticut and New York. By virtue of the opening of these offices, the Fortis Groups operations and investments (including the Fortis Groups investment in us) became subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the BHCA. Except to the extent that a BHCA exemption or authority is available, Section 4 of the BHCA does not permit foreign banking organizations with U.S. branches to own more than 5% of any class of voting shares or otherwise to control any company that conducts commercial activities, such as manufacturing, distribution of goods or real estate development. 107 Table of Contents To broaden the scope of activities and investments permissible for the Fortis Group and us, the Fortis Group in 2002 notified the Federal Reserve of its election to be a financial holding company for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal Reserves implementing regulations in Regulation Y. As a financial holding company, the Fortis Group may own shares of companies engaged in activities in the United States that are financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity or complementary to a financial activity. Activities that are financial in nature include, among other things: insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or providing and issuing annuities; and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing. In connection with Fortis Banks establishment of U.S. branches, staff of the Federal Reserve inquired as to whether certain of our activities are financial in nature under Section 4(k) of the BHCA. In light of the Fortis Groups contemplated divestiture of our shares, this inquiry was suspended at the Fortis Groups and our request. To the extent that any of our activities might be deemed not to be financial in nature under Section 4(k), the Fortis Group may rely on an exemption in Section 4(a)(2) of the BHCA that permits the Fortis Group to continue to hold interests in companies engaged in activities that are not financial in nature for an initial period of two years and, with Federal Reserve approval for each extension, for up to three additional one year periods. The Federal Reserve also has the discretion to permit the Fortis Group to hold such interests after the five year period under certain provisions other than Section 4(a)(2). The initial two year period under Section 4(a)(2) expired on December 2, 2004. The Fortis Group has requested an initial one year extension of the divestiture period. If the Federal Reserve does not grant an extension of the exemption period for any one year period or if Fortis holds more than 5% of any class of our voting shares after December 2, 2007, without the consent or acquiescence of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve determined that certain of our activities are nonfinancial, the Fortis Group may be required (i) to rely on another provision of the BHCA, (ii) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank, or (iii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class of our voting shares and to divest any control over us for purposes of the BHCA. The Fortis Group will continue to qualify as a financial holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains well capitalized and well managed, as those terms are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be considered well capitalized if it maintains tier 1 and total RBC ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively. The Fortis Group will be considered well managed if it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. If the Fortis Group lost and were unable to regain its financial holding company status, the Fortis Group could be required (i) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank or (ii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class of our voting securities and to divest any control over us for purposes of the BHCA. In addition, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA over all of the Fortis Groups direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries will be considered subsidiaries of the Fortis Group for purposes of the BHCA so long as the Fortis Group owns 25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise controls or has been determined to have a controlling influence over us within the meaning of the BHCA. The Federal Reserve could take the position that the Fortis Group continues to control us until the Fortis Group reduces its ownership to less than 5% of our voting shares. So long as the Fortis Group controls us for purposes of the BHCA, the Federal Reserve could require us immediately to discontinue, restructure or divest any of our operations that are deemed to be impermissible under the BHCA, which could result in reduced revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability for us. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may 108 Table of Contents prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate directors entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. The following provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws have anti takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by laws: permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; divide our board of directors into three classes; limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; except for Fortis, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors; prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent; impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; subject to limited exceptions, require the approval of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter to approve mergers and consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and require the approval by the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter for the stockholders to amend the provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation described in the second through seventh bullet points above and this supermajority provision. In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our Company. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person acquiring 5% or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the applicants plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. 109 Table of Contents Our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. From time to time, the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in operating results; natural disasters and terrorist attacks; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; press releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our markets; regulatory changes; sales of stock by insiders; and changes in our financial strength ratings. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset 110 Table of Contents backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. As of December 31, 2004, we held $9,178 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $1,054 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 84% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2003, we held $8,729 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $933 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 85% of total invested assets. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying yield curves. We have assumed that both the United States and Canadian yield curves have a 100% correlation and, therefore, move together. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2004 (100) (50) 0 50 100 (In millions) Total market value $ 9,751 $ 9,460 $ 9,178 $ 8,907 $ 8,649 % Change in market value from base case 6.24 % 3.08 % 0.00 % (2.95 )% (5.77 )% $ Change in market value from base case $ 573 $ 282 $ 0 $ (271 ) $ (528 ) Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. See Item 1 Business Investments. 111 Table of Contents The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2004: Percentage of Rating Fair Value Total (In millions) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,142 67% Baa 2,493 27% Ba 416 5% B and lower 127 1% Total $ 9,178 100% We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $4,133 million of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2004, we are protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,507 million and $882 million as of December 31, 2004 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. We believe that a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated A or better by A.M. Best. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 12% of Assurant PreNeeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $398 million as of December 31, 2004 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing a contract with payments tied to the CPI. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily the British pound and Danish krone. Total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 2% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2004. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. 112 Table of Contents Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract to partially hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our pre funded funeral insurance policies. In 2003 we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments in the December 31, 2003 and 2004 consolidated balance sheet. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance products and related services in North America and selected other markets. We provide: creditor placed homeowners insurance; manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended service contracts; individual health and small employer group health 50 Table of Contents insurance; group dental insurance; group disability insurance; group life insurance and pre funded funeral insurance. The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive profit opportunities. We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. As such, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Revenues We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Our investment portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates, and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 83% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death benefit growth that is either pegged to changes in the CPI or determined periodically at the discretion of the Company. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates 51 Table of Contents and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Expenses Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 19 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2004, we granted approximately 3.9 million stock appreciation rights to our employees and directors. For every dollar by which our stock price exceeds $22.00, we will recognize an expense of approximately $3 million. At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2004, we had $1,970 million and $996 million, respectively of debt and preferred stock. This has had an impact on our annual interest and dividend costs. We will need to comply with certification requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as of December 31, 2005, and we expect to incur increased expenses to comply with these requirements. Regulation Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some of our businesses, such as individual medical products, our revenues and net income will be affected by our ability to get regulatory approval for rate increases. Where rate increases are unacceptable to us, we could withdraw from a state but may for a limited period of time be required to participate in state sponsored risk pools for our former insureds who cannot get replacement policies. For other factors affecting our results of operations or financial condition, see Risk Factors. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following material dispositions, including: On May 3, 2004, we sold the assets of our WorkAbility division of CORE, Inc. (CORE). We recorded a pre tax loss on the sale of $9 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. 52 Table of Contents On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership in Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP) to NHP Holding LLC. We recorded pre tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. Critical Accounting Estimates There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Reserves for the sensitivity analysis of our significant critical accounting estimates. Premiums Short Duration Contracts Our short duration contracts are those on which we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term. Our short duration contracts primarily include: group term life, group disability, group medical and group dental, property and warranty, credit life and disability and extended service contracts and individual medical contracts issued after 2002 in most jurisdictions. Long Duration Contracts Currently, our long duration contracts being sold are pre funded funeral life insurance and investment type annuities. For pre funded funeral life insurance policies, any excess of the gross premium over the net premium is deferred and is recognized in income in a constant relationship with the insurance in force. For pre funded funeral investment type annuity contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and traditional life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from policyholders. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively. Reinsurance Assumed Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates which are based on both payments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Fee Income We primarily derive income from fees received from providing administration services. Fee income is earned when services are performed. 53 Table of Contents Reserves Reserves are established according to GAAP, using generally accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or SAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. Short Duration Contracts For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. For group disability, the case reserves and the IBNR are recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the expected claims future payments. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is reviewed quarterly by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. Group long term disability and group term life reserve adequacy studies are performed annually, and morbidity and mortality assumptions are adjusted where appropriate. Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the unexpired period of the policy. We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for IBNR of $50 million (before reinsurance) and $38.9 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at December 31, 2004. Any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and 54 Table of Contents what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos, environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $2.3 million, $2.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. One of our subsidiaries, ARIC, participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. While the majority of the negotiations, arbitrations and or litigations between the multiple layers of reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries are still ongoing, ARIC and an affiliated company, BICL did resolve disputes with two of its reinsurers in the 1996 and 1997 program years by means of a commutation agreement. As a result of the settlement, the two affiliated reinsurers paid ARIC and BICL $6 million and both parties agreed to release each other from any past, present or future obligations of any kind. Based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that it is not reasonably likely that any liabilities we experience in connection with these programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. Long Duration Contracts Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 or issued in a limited number of jurisdictions and the traditional life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of the future net premiums. These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations. Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral investment type annuities, universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, and the variable life insurance and investment type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances. 55 Table of Contents Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded for these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. DAC The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions including the anticipation of interest income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Short Duration Contracts DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability and group dental consist primarily of new business underwriting, field sales support, commissions to agents and brokers, and compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs are front end loaded; thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical contracts consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation to representatives. These contracts are considered short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these costs are not deferred but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and in a limited numbers of juridictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The 56 Table of Contents majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed businesses were written off when the businesses were sold. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Changes in individual security values are regularly monitored in order to identify potential problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost. Each quarter the watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. At this meeting, any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. Other Accounting Policies For a description of other accounting policies applicable to the periods covered by this report, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Significant Accounting Standard Affecting Our Business On January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS 142. As of our adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In addition, we were required to subject our goodwill to an initial impairment test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to conduct impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment event, our net income will be higher as a result of not having to amortize goodwill. As a result of this initial impairment test, we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,261 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 57 Table of Contents principle as of January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. We performed a January 1, 2003 and 2004 impairment test during the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 and concluded that goodwill was not further impaired. We also performed a January 1, 2005 impairment test during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and management believes that goodwill will not be impaired. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of additional recent accounting standards that are applicable to us. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 6,483 $ 6,157 $ 5,681 Net investment income 635 607 632 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 24 2 (118 ) Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 58 68 80 (Loss)/gain on disposal of businesses (9 ) 11 Fees and other income 213 232 246 Total revenues 7,404 7,066 6,532 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (3,840 ) (3,658 ) (3,435 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses(1) (2,970 ) (2,828 ) (2,609 ) Interest expense (56 ) (1 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2 ) (113 ) (118 ) Premium on redemption of preferred securities (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (6,868 ) (6,806 ) (6,162 ) Income before income taxes 536 260 370 Income taxes (185 ) (74 ) (110 ) Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 351 186 260 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1,261 ) Net income (loss) $ 351 $ 186 $ (1,001 ) (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. Note: The table above includes the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002. These items are only included in this Consolidated Overview. As a result, the tables presented under the segment discussions do not total to the same amounts shown on this consolidated overview table. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 58 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $338 million, or 5%, from $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $7,404 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $326 million, or 5%, from $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $6,483 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase of $87 million and $222 million in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Health, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in the extended service contract, international, and creditor placed and voluntary homeowners businesses. This growth was offset by a decline in domestic credit insurance and our manufactured housing businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increased sales, which partially reflect the success of HSAs, and increased rates. Net investment income increased by $28 million, or 5%, from $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $635 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased 16 basis points from 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in the average portfolio yield was due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 8% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million, or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net realized gains on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we had other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities of $20 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to other investments. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was consistent with the anticipated run off of the business ceded to The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000. See Reinsurance. On May 3, 2004 we sold our WorkAbility division and recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of this business in the second quarter of 2004. Fees and other income decreased by $19 million, or 8%, from $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $213 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $25 million and $9 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and Corporate and Other, respectively, offset by increases of $7 million and $6 million in Assurant Solutions and in Assurant Health, respectively. The decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily driven by lower fee income resulting from the sale of the WorkAbility division. The decrease in Corporate and Other was due to a one time adjustment recorded in third quarter of 2003. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in fees related to growth in extended service contracts and debt deferment businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee based product sales in individual markets. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $62 million, or 1%, from $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $6,868 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $182 million, or 5%, from $3,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $3,840 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases of $37 million, $106 million and $29 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to higher catastrophe 59 Table of Contents losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses from catastrophes, net of reinsurance, of $93 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This was partially offset by improved loss experience in our specialty property business absent the catastrophes. The increase in Assurant Health was consistent with the increase in net earned premiums and other considerations. The increase in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to a reserve reduction in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for the group disability, group life and group dental products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced reserves by $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these estimates. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $142 million, or 5%, from $2,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases of $61 million, $86 million, $10 million and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other, respectively, offset by a decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits of $23 million. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an increase in extended service contract, international and creditor placed homeowners businesses and Sarbanes Oxley related expenses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increased commission expense associated with our individual health businesses. The decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to the sale of the WorkAbility division. The increase in Assurant PreNeed was primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in mix of business to more single pay sales. The increase in Corporate and Other was primarily due to public company costs, including expenses related to our initial and secondary public stock offerings and additional costs related to Sarbanes Oxley. Interest expense increased by $55 million from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was the result of two senior notes that we issued in February 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in January 2004. In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred securities. Net Income Net income increased by $165 million, or 89%, from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $351 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 28.5% compared to 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2004, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act), we repatriated $110 million of capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately $5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction of our tax liability. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $534 million, or 8%, from $6,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 60 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net earned premiums and other considerations was primarily due to increases of $285 million, $175 million, and $23 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $8 million in Assurant PreNeed. The increase in Assurant Solutions was due to growth in specialty property and consumer protection products. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increases in individual health insurance business due to membership growth and premium rate increases. Net investment income decreased by $25 million, or 4%, from $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment yields driven by the lower interest rate environment. The yield on average invested assets was 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.27% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million in the Corporate and Other segment. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. See Reinsurance. Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no disposals in 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 6%, from $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002, associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $222 million, or 6%, from $3,435 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $3,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases of $144 million, $95 million and $8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of $24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty property products, primarily in creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health insurance business, which was consistent with growth in this business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was 61 Table of Contents primarily due to increases of $141 million, $43 million and $11 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was consistent with growth in the specialty property and consumer protection products business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to increases in commissions, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general expenses, which was consistent with the growth in business. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of the preferred securities in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of preferred securities in early January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the preferred securities, we incurred $206 million in interest premiums on redemption for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in 2002. Net Income Net income increased by $1,187 million, or 119%, from a loss of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to a profit of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero recognized in 2003. Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or 33%, from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.5% compared to 29.7% in 2002.

(2) Consumer Protection Solutions includes an array of debt protection, administrative services, credit based programs and extended service contracts. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $92 million, or 3%, from $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,770 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $87 million, or 4% from $2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $51 million in net earned premiums and other considerations from our consumer protection solutions products, primarily due to growth in our extended service contract and international businesses, partially offset by the decline of our domestic credit insurance business. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our specialty property solutions products increased by $36 million, primarily from growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance product lines. This growth was partially offset by lower net earned premiums in our manufactured housing business, primarily due to the overall decline in manufactured housing sales. Net investment income decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased by 40 basis points from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 4.78% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Fees and other income increased by $7 million, or 5%, from $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase in fees related to growth in our extended service contracts and our debt deferment businesses. These increases were partially offset by two factors. The year ended December 31, 2003 included fee income of $6 million pertaining to certain non profitable membership programs that were discontinued in the latter part of 2003 and in the first quarter of 2003 we recognized fees for a one time project. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $98 million, or 4%, from $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $2,587 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $37 million, or 4%, from $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $936 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to higher catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses, net of reinsurance, from catastrophes of $93 million and $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The higher catastrophe losses in 2004 were partially offset by improved loss experience, in our specialty property business absent the catastrophes. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $61 million, or 4%, from $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,651 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $15 million, which is consistent with the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $46 million, primarily due to increased business from our extended service contracts, international, and creditor placed homeowners insurance businesses. Additionally, in 2004 we incurred Sarbanes Oxley related expenses and an increase in guaranty fund assessments attributable to the four hurricanes. 63 Table of Contents Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $7 million, or 5%, from $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes increased by $1 million, or 2%, from $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change in income taxes is consistent with the change in pretax income and reflects a change in the mix of international and domestic taxable income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $277 million, or 12%, from $2,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

This increase was primarily due to $181 million of additional net earned premiums and other considerations attributable to our special property products, primarily due to our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners insurance lines of business generated from new clients and increased sales growth from our existing clients. Consumer protection products also contributed $104 million in net earned premiums and other considerations primarily from growth in our warranty and extended service contracts business. Net investment income decreased by $18 million, or 9%, from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The average portfolio yield dropped 67 basis points from 5.85% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by approximately 3%. Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 8%, from $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the continuing transition of our credit insurance business to our debt protection administration business. We also recognized fees for a one time project in the first quarter of 2003 of $2.9 million. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $144 million, or 19%, from $755 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Our consumer protection products also contributed $32 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our warranty and extended service contracts line of business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling and underwriting expenses, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $116 million, which consisted of $45 million primarily from our specialty property products due to growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of the increase was from our consumer protection products due to increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract lines of business. General expenses increased by $25 million, primarily from start up costs related to setting up new clients in the creditor placed homeowners insurance area and increased business from our warranty and extended service contract products. 64 Table of Contents Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $1 million, or 1%, from $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or 14%, from $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate in 2003.

Net earned premium growth in individual health insurance business was attributable to continued sales which partially reflect the success of the HSAs that were introduced on January 1, 2004, and premium rate increases. Net earned premium growth in our small employer group health insurance business was attributable to premium rate increases partially offset by decreases in membership. Net investment income increased by $19 million, or 39%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $86 million, or 15%, from $589 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $675 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The expense ratio increased by 80 basis points from 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Group disability net earned premiums increased by 68 Table of Contents $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in business written through alternate distribution sources, as well as the transition of a block of business from administrative fee only business to fully insured business. The increase in group disability net earned premiums was partially offset by decreases in group dental and group life net earned premiums and other considerations. Group Dental net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. We are maintaining pricing discipline in an increasingly competitive market, which has resulted in lower sales and renewals. Group life net earned premiums decreased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business during 2003. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 81.1% for 2004, an increase of 120 basis points from 2003. Net investment income increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield declined 17 basis points from 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 6.22% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 10% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December, 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $25 million, or 46%, from $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee income resulting from the sale of the WorkAbility division, as well as the transition of a block of business from administrative fee only business to fully insured business. See Corporate and Other. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, from $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,360 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $29 million, or 3%, from $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $950 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss ratio increased by 110 basis points from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 74.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. These year over year increases were primarily driven by a reduction in reserves in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for group disability, group life, and group dental products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced reserves by $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these estimates. Also contributing to the increase in 2004 was poor experience on a single large disability case and deterioration in group dental experience, partially offset by lower group disability incidence and improved group life mortality experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $23 million or 5% from $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $410 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The expense ratio decreased by 170 basis points from 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by the sale of the WorkAbility division noted earlier, as well as the writedown of previously capitalized software in 2003, not incurred in 2004. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 was $62 million. Income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 were $34 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less than 1%, from $1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 69 Table of Contents Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in disability net earned premium of $61 million was primarily due to additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS. Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the non renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition, dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven by lower sales and the non renewal of a large account. This resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003, which was unchanged from 2002. Net investment income decreased by $8 million, or 5%, from $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was a 77 basis point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.16% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate environment. Average invested assets increased by 6% from 2002 to 2003. Fees and other income decreased by $20 million, or 27%, from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower fee revenue from CORE due to the sale of PRA. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by $13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits decreased by $24 million, or 3%, from $945 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was driven by favorable development in disability claims and lower claim volume due to the reduction in dental and group life net earned premiums. In addition, during the third quarter of 2003, we completed reserve studies for the group disability, group life, and group dental products, which concluded that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant. Adjustments were made to reserves to reflect current mortality and morbidity experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million. The benefits loss ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in 2003. Excluding the reserve release discussed above, the benefits loss ratio improvement was driven primarily by favorable disability experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio increased from 32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to a $6.2 million writedown of previously capitalized software related to our new administration system. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax increased by $5 million, or 9%, from $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income tax expense increased by $3 million, or 10%, from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 9% increase in segment income before tax. 70 Table of Contents Assurant PreNeed Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant PreNeeds segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 526 $ 530 $ 538 Net investment income 206 188 184 Fees and other income 7 5 5 Total revenues 739 723 727 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (531 ) (521 ) (513 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (157 ) (147 ) (137 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (688 ) (668 ) (650 ) Segment income before income tax 51 55 77 Income taxes (17 ) (19 ) (27 ) Segment income after tax $ 34 $ 36 $ 50 Net earned premiums and other considerations by channel: AMLIC $ 273 $ 283 $ 293 Independent 253 247 245 Total $ 526 $ 530 $ 538 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $16 million, or 2%, from $723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $739 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $4 million, or less than 1%, from $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $526 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a 3.6% decline in new sales as a result of our decision to make pricing changes on certain new business as well as a decrease in renewal premiums in the AMLIC channel. These were partially offset by the change in the mix of business from limited pay to single pay sales in the independent channel. Net investment income increased by $18 million, or 10%, from $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The average portfolio yield decreased 23 basis points from 6.57% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 6.34% for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to the lower interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased by approximately 14% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from the year ended December 31, 2003. Fees and other income increased by $2 million, or 40% from $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reason for this increase is $1 million of income related to a derivative instrument, the CPI cap. 71 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $20 million, or 3%, from $668 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $688 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $10 million, or 2%, from $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $531 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a larger in force block of business as well as an increase of $5 million over 2003 related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in growth rates on the discretionary growth business which reduced policyholder benefits by $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in mix of business to more single pay sales. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $2 million, or 6%, from $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 11%, from $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $4 million, or 1%, from $727 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by $8 million, or 2%, from $538 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel which was caused by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI, AMLICs principal customer. Net investment income increased by $4 million, or 2%, from $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. A 8% increase in average invested assets was offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the annualized investment yield, which was 6.91% at December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at December 31, 2003. The increase in average invested assets was due to a larger in force block of business. The rate decline reduced net investment income by $10 million over the comparable prior year period. The decline in yields was due to the lower interest rate environment and the restructuring of the portfolio in 2002 to improve credit quality. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $18 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $668 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Policyholder benefits increased by $8 million, or 2%, from $513 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was due to the increase in business written and other factors. A portion of our pre funded funeral insurance policies use a CPI rate credited on policies. The CPI rate increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition, benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to single pay policies. 72 Table of Contents Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and VOBA expense increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force block of business. Overall general operating expenses before deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable prior year period due to expense control. This reduction includes a $0.7 million charge associated with restructuring of the sales force in our independent division. Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the prior year. Segment Income After Tax Segment income after tax decreased by $14 million, or 28%, from $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was caused primarily by smaller spreads between investment income earned and the fixed benefits credited to policyholders, increased growth credited on the CPI block of business and higher utilization of the early pay off feature. Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or 30%, from $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment income before tax. Corporate and Other Overview The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of the FFG and LTC businesses. The table below presents information regarding Corporate and Others segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ $ $ Net investment income 26 43 40 Net realized gains (losses) on investments 24 2 (118 ) Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 58 68 80 Gain (loss) on disposal of businesses (9 ) 11 Fees and other income 2 11 25 Total revenues 101 124 38 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits Selling, underwriting and general expenses (77 ) (69 ) (55 ) Interest expense (56 ) (1 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2 ) (113 ) (118 ) Premium on redemption of preferred securities (206 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (135 ) (389 ) (173 ) Segment (loss) before income tax (34 ) (265 ) (135 ) Income taxes 5 99 61 Segment (loss) after tax $ (29 ) $ (166 ) $ (74 ) 73 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $330 million (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $23 million, or 19%, from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net investment income decreased by $17 million, or 40%, from $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 mainly due to the lower interest rate environment and the decrease in average invested assets. Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million, or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net realized gains on investments are comprised of both other than temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we had other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity and equity securities of $20 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to other investments. There were no individual impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was consistent with the anticipated run off of the business ceded to The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000. On May 3, 2004, we sold our WorkAbility division and recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of business in the second quarter of 2004. Fees and other income decreased by $9 million, or 82%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to a one time adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2003. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $254 million, or 65%, from $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $8 million, or 12%, from $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to $25 million of public company costs in 2004, including expenses related to our initial and secondary public stock offerings and additional costs related to Sarbanes Oxley. In 2003, we incurred $14 million of public company costs, including expenses related to our initial public offering. Interest expense increased by $55 million from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was the result of the two senior notes that we issued in February 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in January 2004. 74 Table of Contents In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred securities. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after income tax improved by $137 million, or 83%, from $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income tax benefit decreased by $94 million, or 95%, from an income tax benefit of $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to an income tax benefit of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. Also, in December 2004, pursuant to the Jobs Act, we repatriated $110 million of capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately $5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction of our tax liability. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002 Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $86 million, or 226%, from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net investment income increased by $3 million, or 8%, from $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no individual impairments of available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $20 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the effects of other than temporary impairments, we recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million. Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was consistent with the run off of the businesses ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. See Reinsurance. Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre tax gains of $11 million. Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 56%, from $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income recognized in 2002 associated with a settlement true up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of receivables that had been previously written off. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 75 Table of Contents Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to $14 million of consulting and compensation expenses incurred in 2003, related to our initial public offering in February 2004. Distributions on preferred securities decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in mid December 2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities we incurred $206 million of interest premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero recognized in 2002. Segment Loss After Tax Segment loss after tax increased by $92 million, or 124%, from $74 million in 2002 to $166 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to the $206 million of interest premiums incurred related to early extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, partially offset by the favorable $120 million change in net realized capital gains (losses) on investments. Income tax benefit increased by $38 million, or 62%, from $61 million in 2002 to $99 million in 2003. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also recognized the release of approximately $13 million of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic tax matters. Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Fixed maturities $ 9,178 76 % $ 8,729 77 % $ 8,036 77 % Equity securities 527 4 456 4 272 3 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1,054 9 933 8 842 8 Policy loans 65 1 68 1 69 1 Short term investments 300 2 276 2 684 7 Collateral head under securities lending 535 4 420 4 377 3 Other investments 489 4 462 4 181 1 Total investments $ 12,148 100 % $ 11,344 100 % $ 10,461 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 67% and 70% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. As interest rates increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities decreases. 76 Table of Contents The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (pre tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,680 $ 8,230 $ 7,631 Net unrealized gains 498 499 405 Fair value $ 9,178 $ 8,729 $ 8,036 Equities: Cost $ 513 $ 437 $ 265 Net unrealized gains 14 19 7 Fair value $ 527 $ 456 $ 272 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased by $1 million, or less than 1%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $5 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004. The decrease in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the net effect of the change in treasury yields. The 10 year treasury yield decreased 3 basis points between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 and the 5 year treasury yield increased 36 basis points between December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by $94 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $12 million, or 171%, from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003. The increase in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the decline in investment grade corporate securities yield spreads combined with an increase in treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade corporate securities fell by approximately 119 basis points while yields on 10 year treasury securities increased by 44 basis points between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. We recorded $0.6 million, $20 million, and $85.3 million of pre tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, associated with other than temporary declines in value of available for sale securities. We also recorded $4.2 million, $11 million, and zero of pre tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, associated with other investments. The investment category and duration of our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at December 31, 2004 were as follows: Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fixed maturities Bonds: United States Government and government agencies and authorities $ 303 $ (3 ) $ 44 $ (1 ) $ 347 $ (4 ) States, municipalities and political subdivisions 21 1 22 Foreign governments 54 25 (1 ) 79 (1 ) Public utilities 92 (1 ) 3 95 (1 ) All other corporate bonds 553 (6 ) 39 (1 ) 592 (7 ) Total fixed maturities $ 1,023 $ (10 ) $ 112 $ (3 ) $ 1,135 $ (13 ) Equity securities Non redeemable preferred stocks: Non sinking fund preferred stocks $ 88 $ (2 ) $ 7 $ (1 ) $ 95 $ (3 ) Total equity securities $ 88 $ (2 ) $ 7 $ (1 ) $ 95 $ (3 ) 77 Table of Contents The total unrealized losses represent less than 1% of the aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately 77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 474 individual securities with 92% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $0.1 million. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for longer than six months but less than 12 months was approximately $7.9 million, with no security with a book value of greater than $1.0 million having a market value below 86% of book value. As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and concluded that there were no additional other than temporary impairments for the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased. Reserves The following table presents reserve information as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Future policy benefits and expenses $ 6,413 $ 6,235 $ 5,807 Unearned premiums 3,354 3,134 3,208 Claims and benefits payable 3,615 3,472 3,374 Total policy liabilities $ 13,382 $ 12,841 $ 12,389 Future policy benefits and expenses increased by $178 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $428 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. Unearned premiums increased by $220 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and decreased by $74 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to the increase from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 was new extended service contract business assumed in late 2003. The decrease from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 was primarily driven by the run off of our domestic credit insurance contracts, offset by growth in other short duration contracts. Claims and benefits payable increased by $143 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $98 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying business. 78 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 Future Future Policy Claims and Policy Claims and Benefits and Unearned Benefits Benefits and Unearned Benefits Expenses Premiums Payable Expenses Premiums Payable (In millions) Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 2,684 $ 3 $ 14 $ 2,276 $ 3 $ 14 Life insurance no longer offered 525 1 2 688 1 4 Universal life and annuities no longer offered 320 1 12 322 1 17 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,694 48 216 2,744 48 177 All other 190 53 123 205 57 151 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 10 393 13 394 Group disability 4 1,446 4 1,375 Medical 100 349 67 266 Dental 6 35 7 39 Property and warranty 1,105 597 1,149 580 Credit life and disability 655 359 759 403 Extended service contracts 1,347 38 1,023 18 All other 21 31 2 34 Total policy liabilities $ 6,413 $ 3,354 $ 3,615 $ 6,235 $ 3,134 $ 3,472 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Long Duration The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. Historically, loss recognition testing has not resulted in an adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated. 79 Table of Contents Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $50.0 million higher (or $47.7 million lower). If claim termination rates were 10% lower (or higher) than currently assumed, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $33.9 million higher (or $31.7 million lower). The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $12.0 million higher (or $11.3 million lower). As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Group Disability incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $12 million less, $53 million more, and $3 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Group Disability reserves are long term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003, and its related upward revision, reflects the result of reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based on results of those studies, reserves were increased by $44 million, almost all of which was attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to reflect current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability reserve redundancies in 2002 and 2004, which were less than 1% of prior year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning of year case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year case reserves. The difference in actual versus best estimate recovery rates reflects an experience gain, which is recognized in the period the gain is realized. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Group Term Life incurred losses related to prior years were approximately $36 million, $93 million, and $29 million less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A significant portion of the Group Term Life reserve is related to waiver of premium reserves for disabled claimants. Group Term Life waiver of premium reserves are long term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on claims incurred in several prior years. Group Term Life reserves were reduced in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect the results of reserve adequacy studies conducted. Based on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by $59 million. The 80 Table of Contents change in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested assets and recent mortality and recovery experience. Another portion of the Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years described above was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our beginning of year reserves and recovery rates being higher than assumed in our beginning of year wavier of premium reserves. The remaining redundancy was due to shorter than expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid claim dates. These adjustments were made to reflect current yields on invested assets, and recent mortality and recovery experience. These changes were offset by one less year of discounting reflected in the Companys end of year waiver of premium reserves. The differences in actual versus best estimate mortality, recovery and paid claim lag rates reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. The conclusion of the 2003 reserve studies determined that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million, which included $3 million of reserve release relating to the group dental business. Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss development factors for the most recent four months would result in approximately $18 million higher (or $14 million lower) reserves at December 31, 2004. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 80% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our Medical business related to prior years were $50 million, $58 million, and $43 million less than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the short tail nature of this business, these developments related to claims incurred in the preceding year (i.e., in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively). The redundancies in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical reserve estimates, were caused by our claims developing more favorably than expected. Our actual claims experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and lower medical inflation than assumed in our prior year pricing and reserving processes. The differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates, medical provider utilization and medical inflation reflect experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains emerge. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus 81 Table of Contents case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate is selected from the middle to upper end of the third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our property and warranty lines of business related to prior years were $25 million less, $13 million less, and $2 million more than previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys property and warranty lines of business had a small deficiency in 2002 which was largely attributable to a shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional development on the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, contributing to a modest redundancy. In 2004, an improved economic environment led to lower unemployment levels, which meant that loss payments on existing claims as well as payments on new claims in our credit unemployment lines, were not as high as would have been expected. This, coupled with lower reserve levels as a result of reduced premium writings in this line, lead to a redundancy. These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual claim frequencies differing from best estimate claim frequencies, and difference in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the periods they emerge. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in the results of operations. Reinsurance The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of As of As of December 31, December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Reinsurance recoverables $ 4,133 $ 4,377 $ 4,650 Reinsurance recoverables decreased by $244 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by $273 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,389 million, $2,410 million, and $2,255 million at December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 (In millions) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,504 $ 2,551 Ceded unearned premium 767 971 Ceded claims and benefits payable 720 747 Ceded paid losses 142 108 Total $ 4,133 $ 4,377 We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing. 82 Table of Contents Based on our December 31, 2004 results, we anticipate that we will receive approximately $34 million from reinsurers in respect of the 2004 Florida hurricanes. Our benefits, losses and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect this anticipated recovery. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases to facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal entities with business segments that we retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still reflected in our balance sheet. The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was $1,507 million and $1,537 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was $882 million and $873 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We would be responsible for administering this business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a default by reinsurers. In addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to increase the value of the separate account assets relating to modified guaranteed annuity business sold if such value declines below the value of the associated liabilities. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make these payments. Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form 83 Table of Contents of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2004, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was $302 million. For a discussion of the various restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, please see Item 1 Business Regulation and Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividend Policy. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, and $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend payments to our stockholders. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. In December 2003, we entered into two senior bridge credit facilities of $650 million and $1,100 million. The aggregate indebtedness of $1,750 million under the facility was in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. On January 30, 2004, we entered into a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are not in default. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. As of December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. On February 10, 2004, we received a $725.5 million capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. The proceeds from that contribution were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the $650 million senior bridge credit facility and $75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition, we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the $1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our $975 million senior note offerings described below. All amounts outstanding under our senior bridge credit facilities were paid off in 2004. On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975 million. The first series is $500 million in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is 84 Table of Contents payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. In March 2004, we established a $500 million commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. The revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we are in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. On June 1, 2004, August 9, 2004 and October 18, 2004, we used $20 million, $40 million and $40 million, respectively, from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, which was repaid on June 15, 2004, August 20, 2004 and October 29, 2004, respectively. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at December 31, 2004. We did not use the revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and no amounts are currently outstanding. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay the remaining portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our $1,100 million senior bridge facility. Our qualified pension plan was under funded by $57.4 million at December 31, 2004. We established a funding policy in which service cost plus 15% of plan deficit will be contributed annually. In the full year 2004, we made contributions to the pension fund totaling $26 million. This funding policy will be revised annually to take into effect any assumption changes, return on plan assets and funded status of the plan. In accordance with ERISA, there is no expected minimum funding requirement for 2004 or 2005. Our nonqualified plan, which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of $85.2 million at December 31, 2004. The expected Company payments to retirees under this plan are approximately $4 million per year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our post retirement plans (other than pension), which are partially funded with $7 million of assets, had an accumulated post retirement benefit obligation of $54.5 million at December 31, 2004. In the full year 2004, we contributed $5.7 million towards pre funding these benefits. In addition, the expected Company payments to retirees and dependents under the postretirement plan are approximately $1.2 million per year in 2004 and 2005. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our name change and rebranding initiative have been approximately $10 million, which were expensed in 2004. We are not currently planning to make any other significant capital expenditures in 2005. During January 2004, we paid to participants in the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of $25 million in connection with the cash out of all outstanding Fortis incentive rights. In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. 85 Table of Contents The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 834 $ 741 $ 364 Investing activities (644 ) (711 ) (379 ) Financing activities (341 ) 318 (43 ) Net change in cash $ (151 ) $ 348 $ (58 ) Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The key changes of the net cash outflow of $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,238 million, maturities of these securities of $851 million, repayment of debt in the amount of $1,750 million, issuance of debt of $972 million, and issuance of common stock of $725 million. The key changes of the net cash inflow of $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,929 million, maturities of these securities of $1,131 million and issuance of debt in the amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of $1,164 million and maturities of these securities of $858 million. At December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $996 million, as compared to $1,970 million at December 31, 2003 and $1,471 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, this debt consisted of $972 million of senior notes and $24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, Security 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and interest paid $ 38 $ 129 $ 117 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends 1 1 1 Common stock dividends 30 181 42 Total $ 69 $ 311 $ 160 86 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2004, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Contractual obligations: Insurance liabilities(1) $ 1,515 $ 637 $ 256 $ 991 $ 3,399 Debt 975 975 Interest on debt 60 181 181 762 1,184 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 24 24 Operating leases 35 52 37 28 152 Commitments: Investment purchases Outstanding: unsettled trades 35 35 commercial mortgage loans on real estate 32 32 other investments 24 5 29 Total obligations and commitments $ 1,701 $ 875 $ 474 $ 2,780 $ 5,830 (1) Insurance liabilities, reflected in the commitments and contingencies table above, include products for which we are currently making periodic payments and products for which we are not making periodic payments, but for which we believe the amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and determinable. Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The total amount represents the claims and benefits payable on all of our long and short duration contracts with the exception of $216 million related to our FFG and LTC disposed businesses. The payment of these liabilities has been fully reinsured. See Item 1 Business Business Dispositions. Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of $6,413 million and unearned premiums of $3,354 million as of December 31, 2004 have been excluded from the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above because the determination of these liability amounts and the timing of payments are not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event, payment triggering or revenue recognition event has not yet occurred. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan liability was $49 million. This liability will be paid based on the plan description. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $66 million and $117 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. 87 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Company Our profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business. Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties with which we do business are important to the success of our business segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with several mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers and other financial institutions through which we distribute our products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution relationships for our individual health insurance products with IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), and USAA, as well as a relationship with HAA, the association through which we provide many of our individual health insurance products through Assurant Healths agreement dated September 1, 2003 with its administrator, NAC. An association in the health insurance market is an entity formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance and does not make health insurance coverage offered through the association available other than in connection with membership in the association. The agreement that provides for our exclusive distribution relationship with IPSI terminates in June 2008, but may be extended if agreed to by both parties. We also maintain contractual relationships with several separate networks of health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. A PPO is an entity that acts as an intermediary between an insurer and a network of hospitals, physicians, dentists or other providers of health care who have agreed to provide care to insureds subject to contractually established reimbursement rates. In Assurant PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one to five years. Although we believe we have generally been successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to terminate these arrangements or seek to renew these contracts on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services, which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with PPOs could also lead to higher medical or dental costs and or a loss of members to other medical or dental plans. For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few clients over the last three years as a result of bankruptcies and termination of contracts either by it or its clients; however, none of the clients lost was significant to its business. At Assurant Health, client turnover has been stable over the last three years as none of the clients lost was significant to its business. Assurant PreNeed terminated several client relationships with three funeral home groups in 2003 because of profitability issues with the business; none of the clients terminated was significant to its business. Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or develop and maintain distribution sources. We distribute our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels including: independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life agents, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, funeral directors, association groups and other third party marketing organizations. Our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. We do not distribute our insurance products and services through captive or affiliated agents. In Assurant Health, we depend in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on associations, including HAA, in the marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our customers, market and distribute our products. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us and usually also market products of our competitors. Strong competition exists 88 Table of Contents among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales representatives, agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, compensation and product features. In addition, by relying on independent agents and brokers to distribute products for us, we face continued competition from our competitors products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory environment. Recently, the marketing of health insurance through association groups and broker compensation arrangements have come under increased scrutiny. An interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various third party distributors or our inability to respond to regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have our own sales representatives whose role in the distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. General economic, financial market and political conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic, financial market and political conditions. These conditions include economic cycles such as insurance industry cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer lending, levels of inflation and movements of the financial markets. Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy, demographics, and legislative and competitive factors also influence our performance. During periods of economic downturn: individuals and businesses may choose not to purchase our insurance products and other related products and services, may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased or, in Assurant Employee Benefits and in small group employer health insurance in Assurant Health, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to rising unemployment levels; new disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise; there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment levels; and insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits. In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our pre funded funeral insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. Pre funded funeral insurance provides benefits to fund the costs incurred in connection with a pre arranged funeral contract, which is an arrangement between a funeral firm and an individual whereby the funeral firm agrees to perform a selected funeral upon the individuals death. Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and capital. We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims IBNR as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or SAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts 89 Table of Contents and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. However, future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss limitation methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and property coverages. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Utilization review is a review process designed to control and limit medical expenses, which includes, among other things, requiring certification for admission to a health care facility and cost effective ways of handling patients with catastrophic illnesses. Claims management entails the use of a variety of means to mitigate the extent of losses incurred by insureds and the corresponding benefit cost, which includes efforts to improve the quality of medical care provided to insureds and to assist them with vocational services. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by: changes in health and dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments. The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes, by insurance regulations, existing contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions or other factors. Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales and profitability. Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses that could reduce our profitability. Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant fluctuations in the fixed income market could impair our profitability, financial condition and or cash flows. Our investments are 90 Table of Contents subject to market wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In particular, volatility of claims may force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our net investment income was $635 million and our net realized gains on investments were $24 million, which collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues during such period. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our net investment income was $607 million and our net realized gains on investments were $2 million, which collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenues during such period. The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions. Changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments, which comprised $9,478 million, or 82%, of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2004 and $9,005 million, or 82%, as of December 31, 2003. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates, and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. As of December 31, 2004, mortgage backed and other asset backed securities represented approximately $1,677 million, or 14%, of the fair value of our total investments. Because substantially all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of these securities are reflected in our balance sheet. Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We employ asset/ liability matching strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. Our asset/ liability matching strategies include: asset/ liability duration management, structuring our bond and commercial mortgage loan portfolios to limit the effects of prepayments and consistent monitoring of, and appropriate changes to, the pricing of our products. However, these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and no assurances can be given that significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. Whole life insurance refers to a form of life insurance that provides guaranteed death benefits and guaranteed cash values to policyholders. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 83% of Assurant PreNeeds in force insurance policy reserves related to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in the CPI. In extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread between Assurant PreNeeds death benefit growth rates and its investment earnings or a negative spread. As a result, declining interest rates or 91 Table of Contents high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on current interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. Waiver of premium refers to a provision in a life insurance policy pursuant to which an insured with total disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to pay premiums for the duration of the disability or for a stated period, during which time the life insurance coverage provides continued coverage. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and or new claims would need to be calculated using lower discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates. Our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk. We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and preferred stocks. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in investment losses. Further, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer. As of December 31, 2004, we held $9,178 million of fixed maturity securities, or 76% of the fair value of our total invested assets at such date. Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities, which comprised 6% of the fair value of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. These investments generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Other than temporary impairment losses on our available for sale securities totaled $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, less than 1% of the fair value of our total investments was invested in common stock; however, we have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such investments in the future. Investments in common stock generally provide higher expected total returns, but present greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed income investments. In addition, while currently we do not utilize derivative instruments to hedge or manage our interest rate or equity risk, we may do so in the future. Derivative instruments generally present greater risk than fixed income investments or equity investments because of their greater sensitivity to market fluctuations. Effective as of August 1, 2003, we utilize derivative instruments in managing Assurant PreNeeds exposure to inflation risk. While these instruments seek to protect a portion of Assurant PreNeeds existing business that is tied to the CPI, a sharp increase in inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments subject us to liquidity risk. As of December 31, 2004, commercial mortgage loans on real estate investments represented approximately 9% of the fair value of our total investments. These types of investments are relatively illiquid, thus increasing our liquidity risk. In addition, if we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both. The risk parameters of our investment portfolio may not target an appropriate level of risk, thereby reducing our profitability and diminishing our ability to compete and grow. We seek to earn returns on our investments to enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to our customers. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each of our business segments. However, we may not succeed in targeting an appropriate overall risk level for our investment portfolio. As a result, the return on our investments may be insufficient to 92 Table of Contents meet our profit targets over the long term, thereby reducing our profitability. If, in response, we choose to increase our product prices to maintain profitability, we may diminish our ability to compete and grow. Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments. Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition, under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us after a loan default. Catastrophe losses, including man made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other personal business lines. We have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics, or can be man made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible that both the frequency and severity of man made catastrophes will increase and that we will not be able to implement exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance for such catastrophes. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal lines coverages, which for the year ended December 31, 2004 represented approximately 26% of our net earned premiums and other consideration in our Assurant Solutions segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 35.6% of the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal lines related to properties located in California, Florida and Texas. As a result of our creditor placed homeowners insurance product, which typically provides coverage against an insureds property being destroyed or damaged by various perils, our concentration in these areas may increase in the future. This is because in our creditor placed homeowners insurance line, we agree to provide homeowners insurance coverage automatically. If other insurers withdraw coverage in these or other states, this may lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our creditor placed homeowners insurance in these areas. Adverse selection refers to the process by which an applicant who believes himself to be uninsurable, or at greater than average risk, seeks to obtain an insurance policy at a standard premium rate. Claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Our ability to write new business also could be affected. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophes in the future. 93 Table of Contents Pre tax catastrophe losses in excess of $1 million (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent years include: total losses of approximately $10 million incurred in 2001 in connection with tropical storm Allison; total losses of approximately $12 million incurred in 2002 in connection with Arizona wildfires, Texas floods and Hurricane Lili; total losses of approximately $30 million incurred in 2003 in connection with various catastrophes caused by windstorms, hailstorms and tornadoes, Hurricane Isabel and the California wildfires; and total losses of approximately $125 million incurred through December 31, 2004 in connection with the four Florida hurricanes. Total reinsurance recoveries related to these events are anticipated to be approximately $34 million. No liquidation in investments was required in connection with these catastrophes as the claims were paid from current cash flow, cash on hand or short term investments. In addition, our group life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care. The mortality rate refers to the relationship of the frequency of deaths of individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time. The morbidity rate refers to the relationship of the incidence of disease or disability contracted by individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time. For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths. Losses due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in Assurant PreNeed the average age of policyholders is in excess of 72 years. This group is more susceptible to epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our successful utilization of catastrophic property and life reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a single event or multiple events, and life and disability reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently widely available. This means that the occurrence of a significant catastrophe could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to the terrorist assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance for man made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity constraints and, to the limited extent available, much more expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results. If we fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect our ability to write future business. As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life, property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay 94 Table of Contents such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurers insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have maintained reinsurance on a significant portion of our Assurant Health business, but we will not renew or replace this reinsurance effective as of December 31, 2004 and therefore, we will not be entitled to certain reinsurance recoverables to which we were previously entitled. We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent. We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of the insurance operations of our FFG division to The Hartford. The assets backing the liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust, and the separate accounts relating to the FFG business are still reflected on our balance sheet. Such separate accounts represent assets allocated under certain policies and contracts that are segregated from the general account and other separate accounts. The policyholder or contractholder bears the risk of investments held in a separate account. However, we would be responsible for administering this business in the event of a default by the reinsurer. We do not have the administrative systems and capabilities to process this business today. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to the credit risk of our agents in Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant Solutions. We advance agents commissions as part of our pre funded funeral insurance product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage as opposed to a percentage of the first year premium paid, the formula that is more common in other life insurance markets. There is a one year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. There is a very large producer within Assurant PreNeed and if it were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, we have not had any loss experience with this very large producer to date. In addition, we are subject to the credit risk of the parties with which we contract in Assurant Solutions. If these parties fail to remit payments owed to us or pass on payments they collect on our behalf, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. A further decline in the manufactured housing market may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant decline in both shipments and retail sales in the last six years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased from approximately 350,000 in 1999 to approximately 120,000 (annualized) in 2004, representing a 66% decline. Repossessions are at an all time high, resale values have been significantly reduced and several lenders, dealers, manufacturers and vertically integrated manufactured housing companies have either ceased operations or gone bankrupt. This downturn in the industry is the result of several factors, including excess production, aggressive sales practices, reduced underwriting standards and poor lending practices. As a result of this downturn, the industry has experienced consolidation, with the leaders purchasing the weaker competitors. If these downward trends continue, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 95 Table of Contents The financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moodys, and S&P, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best. Six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moodys and seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P. The ratings reflect A.M. Bests, Moodys, and S&Ps opinions of our subsidiaries financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. The ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moodys, and S&P, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings. All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best have financial strength ratings of A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A are Excellent) or A (Excellent), which is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The Moodys financial strength rating is A2 (Good) for one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are Good), and A3 (Good) for five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. The S&P financial strength rating is A (Strong) for four of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A are Strong), and A (Strong) for three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers. Rating agencies review their ratings periodically and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, or S&P, or placed under surveillance or review with possible negative implications, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could suffer and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to, among other things: the competitive environment in the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. As customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moodys, or S&P, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Contracts representing approximately 22% of Assurant Solutions net earned premiums and fee income for the year ended December 31, 2004 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from A or better to B or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts if the subsidiaries ratings fall below these minimum acceptable levels. Under our ten year marketing agreement with SCI, AMLIC, one of our subsidiaries in the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. In our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments, we do not have any material contracts that permit termination in the case of a ratings downgrade. 96 Table of Contents The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is dependent upon our ability to keep up to date with technological advances. This is particularly important in Assurant Solutions, where our systems, including our ability to keep our systems integrated with those of our clients, are critical to the operation of our business. Our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we have spent approximately $118 million in Assurant Solutions, $81 million in Assurant Health, $67 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information systems. In 2005, we plan to spend for these purposes approximately $126 million in Assurant Solutions, $89 million in Assurant Health, $62 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant PreNeed. In addition, our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we do not maintain adequate systems we could experience adverse consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers; customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation exposure; or increases in administrative expenses. Our management information, internal control and financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and development to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements of being a public company. Efforts to comply with the Sarbanes Oxley Act will entail significant expenditure; non compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act may adversely affect us. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE require changes to some of our accounting and corporate governance practices, including the requirement that we issue a report on our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act by December 31, 2005. We expect these new rules and regulations to continue to increase our accounting, legal and other costs, and to make some activities more difficult, time consuming and or costly. In the event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related rules, it may have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers, reduction to our profitability and or subject us to fines and penalties. A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health segment is the subject of national and state legislation, including the HIPAA, and certain of the activities conducted by our Assurant Solutions segment are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect such confidential information vary by business segment and may include among other things: training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information; actively monitoring our record 97 Table of Contents retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements; drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues; maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic information and maintaining a clean desk policy aimed at safeguarding certain current information. In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information we could experience adverse consequences, including loss of clients and related revenue, regulatory problems, loss of reputation and client litigation. See Risks Related to Our Industry Cost of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. While our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new insurance ventures have played a significant role in achieving desired market positions in some, but not all, of our businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a number of risks, including among other things: inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that most of our acquisitions have been successful and have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, we did recognize a goodwill impairment of $1,261 million in 2002 related to an earlier acquisition. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder dividends. As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiarys assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary. 98 Table of Contents The payment of dividends to us by any of our operating subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiarys domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior years statutory net income. In some states, the formula is the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us in 2005 without regulatory approval is approximately $364 million. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million through December 31, 2004. We may seek approval of regulators to pay dividends in excess of any amounts that would be permitted without such approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would seek such approval or would obtain such approval. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses. Our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders if we are in default or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default of the credit facilities. Risks Related to Our Industry Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. In addition to the occasional employment related litigation to which businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in, various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to, our insurance and other related business operations. We may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to: disputes over coverage or claims adjudication; disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements; disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims; disputes concerning past premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race; disputes relating to customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various business segments; disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions; disputes relating to certain excess of loss programs in the London market; disputes with taxing authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us. The outcome of these actions cannot be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such actions or any litigation would not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In 99 Table of Contents addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies. Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses. Recently, the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current litigation, investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry. These practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed, the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes and the use of inducements to brokers or companies in the sale of group insurance products. In accordance with a long standing and widespread industry practice, we have paid and may continue to pay contingent commissions to insurance brokers and agents, primarily in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. We purchase reinsurance, including but not limited to reinsurance agreements that share risks and profits with certain clients in our Assurant Solutions segment on business produced by these clients. These clients include mortgage lenders and servicers, financial institutions and retailers. We have received inquiries and informational requests from insurance departments in certain states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate. We have conducted an internal review under the supervision of outside counsel to confirm that our employees have not provided inflated or fictitious quotes or used improper inducements in the sale of group insurance products in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. Another focus of regulators has been the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. One of our reinsurers thinks we should have been accounting for premiums ceded to them as a loan instead of as an expense. Management believes that the difference in treatment would be immaterial to the Companys financial position or results of operations. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, premiums ceded to this reinsurer were $2.6 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and losses ceded were $10 million, $0, and $0, respectively. We cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation, investigations and regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our business. Given our prominent position in the insurance industry, it is possible that we will become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed against us. Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines and damages, perhaps in material amounts. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by the negative publicity for the insurance industry related to these proceedings, and by any new industry wide regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings. See Item 1 Business Regulation. We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be profitable. In each of our lines of business, we compete with other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line and product, although we have no single competitor who competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate. Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities. Competitors include insurance companies and financial institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors include health insurance companies, HMO and the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include benefits and life insurance companies as well as not for profit Delta Dental plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two pre need life insurance companies with nationwide representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business. 100 Table of Contents Competition in our businesses is based on many factors, including quality of service, product features, price, scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies. We compete not only for business and individual customers, employer and other group customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without being subject to insurance regulations. Credit insurance is insurance issued to cover the life, unemployment or disability of a debtor or borrower for an outstanding loan. Also, as a result of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which was enacted in November 1999, financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our own. This has resulted in new competitors with significant financial resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do, which may lead them to price their products and services lower than we do. In addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. For example, several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a substantial market share. In addition, with regard to Assurant Health, organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able to compete effectively in such markets. New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers. The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our results. The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for periods ranging from two to six years. The segments of the insurance markets in which we operate tend not to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality. Periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of underwriting capacity permit more favorable rate levels, consequent fluctuations in underwriting results and the occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these markets. Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the insurer, including competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. This may cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our product prices in order to maintain our market position, because of the adverse effect on profitability of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations of appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other factors affecting the insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 101 Table of Contents The insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results. The nature of the market for the insurance and related products and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting our industries to the possibility of periodic negative publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. We are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as: licensing companies to transact business; authorizing lines of business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating underwriting limitations; imposing dividend limitations; regulating changes in control; licensing agents and distributors of insurance products; placing limitations on the minimum and maximum size of life insurance contracts; restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets; admitting statutory assets; mandating certain insurance benefits; restricting companies ability to terminate or cancel coverage; requiring companies to provide certain types of coverage; regulating premium rates, including the ability to increase premium rates; approving policy forms; regulating trade and claims practices; imposing privacy requirements; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; restricting certain transactions between affiliates; regulating the content of disclosures to debtors in the credit insurance area; 102 Table of Contents regulating the type, amounts and valuation of investments; mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds; regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents; and restricting contact with consumers, such as the recently created national do not call list, and imposing consumer protection measures. Assurant Health is also required by some jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by insurers. Each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to some risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of individuals. HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning July 1, 1997. See also Risks Related to Our Industry Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The capacity for an insurance companys growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by SAP and procedures, is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies. We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authoritys interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. That type of action could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1 Business Regulation. Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions; 103 Table of Contents limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impositions of fines, taxes or other penalties for improper licensing, the failure to promptly pay claims, however defined, or other regulatory violations; increased licensing requirements; prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations; new benefit mandates; increased regulation relating to the use of associations and trusts in the sale of individual health insurance; limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and, as a result, manage health care and utilization due to any willing provider legislation, which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement; limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider; and restriction of solicitation of pre funded funeral insurance consumers by funeral board laws. State legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory projects, all of which can affect our operations. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, could significantly impact the insurance industry and us. Federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. In addition, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care issues. The U.S. Congress is considering Patients Bill of Rights legislation, which, if adopted, would permit health plans to be sued in state court for coverage determinations and could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. There recently have been legislative attempts to limit ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. For example, the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, there have been attempts by the NAIC and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in policy forms. The elimination of discretionary clauses could increase our liability under our health insurance policies. New interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would, among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures, require plans to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a national health insurance program. Any of these proposals, if implemented, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Federal changes in 104 Table of Contents Medicare and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have negative implications for the private sector due to cost shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers. State small employer group and individual health insurance market reforms to increase access and affordability could also reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing for risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance policies. In addition, the U.S. Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal incorporation, similar to banks. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the federal government has granted charters in years past to insurance like organizations that are not subject to state insurance regulations, such as risk retention groups. See Item 1 Business Regulation United States Federal Regulation Legislative Developments. Thus, it is hard to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or on us. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. In addition, the insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements. See Item 1 Business Regulation. It is difficult to predict the effect of the current investigations in connection with insurance industry practices. See Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions. Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The privacy of individuals has been the subject of recent state and federal legislation. State privacy laws, particularly those with opt in clauses, can affect the pre funded funeral insurance business and Solutions business. These laws make it harder to share information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created do not call list would restrict our ability to contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our expectations for growth in our direct marketed consumer credit insurance products in the United States. HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have thus far been adopted impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of the required transactions or that other entities with which we interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims. HIPAA is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties. In addition, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act requires that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of the insurance policy and annually thereafter. Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing agreements. However, certain state laws may require individuals to opt in 105 Table of Contents to information sharing instead of being immediately included. This could significantly increase costs of doing business. Additionally, when final U.S. Treasury Department regulations are promulgated in connection with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to expend additional resources to tailor our existing anti fraud efforts to the new rules. Risks Related to Our Relationship with Fortis Fortis will continue to have representation on our board of directors and influence our affairs for as long as it remains a significant stockholder. As of March 4, 2005, Fortis owned 22,999,130 shares, or approximately 16%, of our outstanding common stock. We have entered into a shareholders agreement with Fortis pursuant to which Fortis has the right to nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, two designees (out of a maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our board of directors. However, we agreed with Fortis to terminate the shareholders agreement effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate governance arrangements will come into effect. These arrangements include that, if at any time while there are no vacancies on our 12 member board of directors, our board of directors, or a committee thereof, adopts a resolution (i) recommending to our shareholders that a particular candidate be elected to our board of directors to replace one of the Fortis designees or (ii) appointing to our board of directors a new member, then Fortis will cause one of the Fortis designees to resign from our board of directors promptly following the adoption of such resolution. In addition, if at any time Fortis ceases to own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, Fortis will promptly cause any remaining Fortis designees to resign from our board of directors. See Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for additional information on related party transactions between our Company and Fortis. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that for so long as Fortis continues to own less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, our board of directors will consist of no more than 12 directors (including at least seven independent directors). Pursuant to our shareholders agreement with Fortis, Fortis has the right to nominate two designees to our board of directors (out of a maximum of 12 directors), and the shareholders agreement and our by laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those designees. However, we agreed with Fortis to terminate the shareholders agreement effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate governance arrangements will come into effect. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Corporate Governance Arrangements. Fortis sale of the exchangeable bonds concurrently with the closing of the secondary offering will not affect Fortis board rights unless the exchangeable bonds are exchanged for shares of our common stock. The exchangeable bonds and the 22,999,130 shares of Assurant common stock into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 106 Table of Contents Because Fortis will control us, conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us. Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could arise which may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us, including, but not limited to, the following areas: Stock Ownership. Our shareholders agreement provides that for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, the following actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis, as stockholder: any recapitalization, reclassification, spin off or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our principal subsidiaries; or any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to us or our subsidiaries. For more information regarding the shareholders agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Shareholders Agreement. However, under our new corporate governance arrangements with Fortis, which became effective upon the closing of the secondary offering, we will no longer be required to obtain Fortis approval for such corporate actions, but Fortis will agree to vote its shares of our common stock in favor of any such corporate action if, at any time while at least one Fortis designee remains on our board of directors, our board of directors, including any Fortis designee, votes in favor of such corporate action. For more information regarding these matters, see Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. The exchangeable bonds and the shares of Assurant common stock into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Cross Directorships. Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are directors of our Company who are also currently directors and or officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group. Service as both a director of our Company and as a director or officer of Fortis or the Fortis Group or ownership interests of directors or officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis Group could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. Our directors who are also directors or officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group will have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For example, these decisions could relate to: disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition or disposition opportunity; or corporate finance decisions. Allocation of Business Opportunities. Although we do not expect Fortis Group to compete with us in the near term, there may be business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis Group and us. Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to Fortis and we may have no recourse against the Fortis designees or the Fortis Group. We have no formal mechanisms for allocating business opportunities. Because Fortis Bank operates U.S. branch offices, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. Fortis Bank S.A./N.V. (Fortis Bank), which is a company in the Fortis Group, obtained approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) to establish branch offices in Connecticut and New York. By virtue of the opening of these offices, the Fortis Groups operations and investments (including the Fortis Groups investment in us) became subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the BHCA. Except to the extent that a BHCA exemption or authority is available, Section 4 of the BHCA does not permit foreign banking organizations with U.S. branches to own more than 5% of any class of voting shares or otherwise to control any company that conducts commercial activities, such as manufacturing, distribution of goods or real estate development. 107 Table of Contents To broaden the scope of activities and investments permissible for the Fortis Group and us, the Fortis Group in 2002 notified the Federal Reserve of its election to be a financial holding company for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal Reserves implementing regulations in Regulation Y. As a financial holding company, the Fortis Group may own shares of companies engaged in activities in the United States that are financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity or complementary to a financial activity. Activities that are financial in nature include, among other things: insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or providing and issuing annuities; and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing. In connection with Fortis Banks establishment of U.S. branches, staff of the Federal Reserve inquired as to whether certain of our activities are financial in nature under Section 4(k) of the BHCA. In light of the Fortis Groups contemplated divestiture of our shares, this inquiry was suspended at the Fortis Groups and our request. To the extent that any of our activities might be deemed not to be financial in nature under Section 4(k), the Fortis Group may rely on an exemption in Section 4(a)(2) of the BHCA that permits the Fortis Group to continue to hold interests in companies engaged in activities that are not financial in nature for an initial period of two years and, with Federal Reserve approval for each extension, for up to three additional one year periods. The Federal Reserve also has the discretion to permit the Fortis Group to hold such interests after the five year period under certain provisions other than Section 4(a)(2). The initial two year period under Section 4(a)(2) expired on December 2, 2004. The Fortis Group has requested an initial one year extension of the divestiture period. If the Federal Reserve does not grant an extension of the exemption period for any one year period or if Fortis holds more than 5% of any class of our voting shares after December 2, 2007, without the consent or acquiescence of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve determined that certain of our activities are nonfinancial, the Fortis Group may be required (i) to rely on another provision of the BHCA, (ii) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank, or (iii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class of our voting shares and to divest any control over us for purposes of the BHCA. The Fortis Group will continue to qualify as a financial holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains well capitalized and well managed, as those terms are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be considered well capitalized if it maintains tier 1 and total RBC ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively. The Fortis Group will be considered well managed if it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. If the Fortis Group lost and were unable to regain its financial holding company status, the Fortis Group could be required (i) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank or (ii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class of our voting securities and to divest any control over us for purposes of the BHCA. In addition, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA over all of the Fortis Groups direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries will be considered subsidiaries of the Fortis Group for purposes of the BHCA so long as the Fortis Group owns 25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise controls or has been determined to have a controlling influence over us within the meaning of the BHCA. The Federal Reserve could take the position that the Fortis Group continues to control us until the Fortis Group reduces its ownership to less than 5% of our voting shares. So long as the Fortis Group controls us for purposes of the BHCA, the Federal Reserve could require us immediately to discontinue, restructure or divest any of our operations that are deemed to be impermissible under the BHCA, which could result in reduced revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability for us. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may 108 Table of Contents prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate directors entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. The following provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws have anti takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by laws: permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; divide our board of directors into three classes; limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; except for Fortis, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors; prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent; impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; subject to limited exceptions, require the approval of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter to approve mergers and consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and require the approval by the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter for the stockholders to amend the provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation described in the second through seventh bullet points above and this supermajority provision. In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our Company. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person acquiring 5% or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the applicants plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. 109 Table of Contents Our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. From time to time, the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in operating results; natural disasters and terrorist attacks; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; press releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our markets; regulatory changes; sales of stock by insiders; and changes in our financial strength ratings. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset 110 Table of Contents backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. As of December 31, 2004, we held $9,178 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $1,054 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 84% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2003, we held $8,729 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and $933 million of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total of 85% of total invested assets. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying yield curves. We have assumed that both the United States and Canadian yield curves have a 100% correlation and, therefore, move together. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2004 (100) (50) 0 50 100 (In millions) Total market value $ 9,751 $ 9,460 $ 9,178 $ 8,907 $ 8,649 % Change in market value from base case 6.24 % 3.08 % 0.00 % (2.95 )% (5.77 )% $ Change in market value from base case $ 573 $ 282 $ 0 $ (271 ) $ (528 ) Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. See Item 1 Business Investments. 111 Table of Contents The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2004: Percentage of Rating Fair Value Total (In millions) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,142 67% Baa 2,493 27% Ba 416 5% B and lower 127 1% Total $ 9,178 100% We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $4,133 million of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2004, we are protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,507 million and $882 million as of December 31, 2004 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. We believe that a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated A or better by A.M. Best. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 12% of Assurant PreNeeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $398 million as of December 31, 2004 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing a contract with payments tied to the CPI. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily the British pound and Danish krone. Total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 2% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2004. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. 112 Table of Contents Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract to partially hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our pre funded funeral insurance policies. In 2003 we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments in the December 31, 2003 and 2004 consolidated balance sheet. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
