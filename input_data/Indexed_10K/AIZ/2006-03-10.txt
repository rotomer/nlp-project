Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held, interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments and additional costs associated with excess of loss reinsurance and ceded to certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. Therefore, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Revenues We generate our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit 48 Table of Contents insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decease with interest rates. We also have investments that carry pre payment risk, such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities. Actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from estimates at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. Therefore, we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. Expenses Our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting and general expenses, interest expense and distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting policyholder benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future policyholder benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 8 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had $995,850 and $995,771, respectively of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. This has had an impact on our annual interest and dividend costs. Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following dispositions, including: On November 9, 2005, the Company signed an agreement with Forethought whereby the Company agreed to discontinue writing new PreNeed insurance polices in the United States via independent funeral homes and 49 Table of Contents non SCI Corporate funeral home chains for a period of 10 years. The Company will receive payments from Forethought over the next ten years based on the amount of business the Company transitions to Forethought. This agreement does not impact Assurant PreNeeds Independent Canada or AMLICs relationship with SCI. The transaction will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operation. On May 3, 2004, we sold the assets of our WorkAbility division of CORE, Inc. (CORE). We recorded a pre tax loss on the sale of $9,232, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. Critical Accounting Estimates There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Item 1A. Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Reserves Reserves are established according to GAAP using generally accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. 50 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Future policy benefits and expenses Unearned premiums Claims and benefits payable Future policy benefits and expenses Unearned premiums Claims and benefits payable (in thousands) Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 2,902,918 $ 3,616 $ 14,919 $ 2,683,950 $ 3,482 $ 13,826 Life insurance no longer offered 513,426 820 2,129 524,612 879 2,082 Universal life and other products no longer offered 346,928 1,699 7,467 362,866 136 8,453 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,724,575 46,956 233,554 2,693,775 47,575 216,322 Medical 172,441 31,650 96,792 184,967 52,609 122,707 All other 4,566 608 16,472 5,543 43 10,459 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 6,207 389,994 9,579 393,051 Group disability 2,110 1,498,916 3,826 1,436,369 Medical 89,776 324,106 99,849 353,538 Dental 4,226 27,964 5,900 35,312 Property and warranty 1,261,145 947,018 1,105,214 686,494 Credit life and disability 571,723 275,243 656,287 339,619 Extended service contracts 1,784,292 34,626 1,346,515 38,000 All other 46,786 6,023 22,405 5,472 Total policy liabilities $ 6,664,854 $ 3,851,614 $ 3,875,223 $ 6,455,713 $ 3,354,299 $ 3,661,704 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Long Duration Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and provide for possible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Risks related to the reserves recorded for contracts from FFG and LTC disposed businesses have been 100% ceded via reinsurance. While the Company has not been released from the contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic and mortality assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect the Company unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer. We have sold businesses through reinsurance. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum 51 Table of Contents liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. Historically, loss recognition testing has not resulted in an adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated. Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are reported when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group long term disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. Claims andBenefits Payable Claims andBenefits Payable Group disability, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points $ 1,568,792 Group disability, claim termination rate 10% lower $ 1,552,313 Group disability, as reported $ 1,498,916 Group disability, as reported $ 1,498,916 Group disability, discount rate increased by 100 basis points $ 1,433,016 Group disability, claim termination rate 10% higher $ 1,449,329 The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. Claims and Benefits Payable Group term life, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points $398,440 Group term life, as reported $389,994 Group life, discount rate increased by 100 basis points $ 382,191 52 Table of Contents Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation, including the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. Under the loss development method, we estimate ultimate losses for each incident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. Under the projected claim method, we use ultimate loss ratios when development methods do not provide enough data to reliably estimate reserves. We use several methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. Claims and Benefits Payable Medical, loss development factor 1% lower $ 347,106 * Medical, as reported $ 324,106 Medical, loss development factor 1% higher $ 308,106 * * This refers to loss development factor for the most recent four months. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 85% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate is selected from the middle to upper end of the third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in our results of operations. While management has used its best judgment in establishing its estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. If 53 Table of Contents the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves will be different than managements estimate. The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity levels on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2005 would be as follows: Change in both loss frequency andseverity for all Property and Warranty Ultimate cost of claims occurring in 2005 Change in cost of claimsoccurring in 2005 3% higher $ 1,004,691 $ 57,673 2% higher $ 985,278 $ 38,260 1% higher $ 966,053 $ 19,035 Base scenario $ 947,018 $ 0 1% lower $ 927,983 $ (19,035 ) 2% lower $ 908,758 $ (38,260 ) 3% lower $ 889,345 $ (57,673 ) Reserving for Asbestos and Other Claims We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We believe the balance of case reserves for these liabilities and bulk reserves for IBNR are adequate. However, any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. One of our subsidiaries, ARIC, participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to retrocessionaires. ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaries, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of the disputes involving ARIC and an affiliate, Bankers Insurance Company Limited (BICL), relating to the 1995 and 1997 program years, have been resolved by settlement or arbitration. As a result of the settlements and an arbitration (in which ARIC did not prevail) additional information became available in 2005, and, based on managements best estimate, we increased our reserves and recorded a total pre tax charge of $61,943 for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively. On February 28, 2006, many of the disputes relating to losses in the 1996 program were settled. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1996 program were adequate. Negotiations, arbitrations and litigation are still ongoing or will be scheduled for the remaining disputes. We believe, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the 54 Table of Contents uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. DAC The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions, including the anticipation of interest income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. These acquisition costs consist primarily of first year commissions paid to agents and sales and policy issue costs. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to worksite group disability consist primarily of first year commissions to brokers and one time policy transfer fees and costs of issuing new certificates. These acquisition costs are front end loaded, thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and in a limited number of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Short Duration Contracts Acquisition costs relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability and group dental consist primarily of new business underwriting, field sales support, commissions to agents and brokers, and compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs are front end loaded; thus, they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical contracts consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation to representatives. 55 Table of Contents These contracts are considered short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these costs are not deferred, but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Changes in individual security values are regularly monitored in order to identify potential problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost. Each quarter, the watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. At this meeting, any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report and Item 1A Risk Factors Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2005 As ofDecember 31, 2004 (in thousands) Reinsurance recoverables $ 4,447,810 $ 4,196,810 We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,440,480 and $2,389,622 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 56 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 (in thousands) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,565,223 $ 2,507,450 Ceded unearned premium 691,787 767,124 Ceded claims and benefits payable 928,882 716,871 Ceded paid losses 261,918 205,365 Total $ 4,447,810 $ 4,196,810 We utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, client risk and profit sharing. See also Item 7AQuantative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Credit Risk. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. Contingencies We follow the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). This requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is reported if reasonably estimable and probable. We establish reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or, if no one estimated number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, we report an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimated range. Contingencies affecting the Company include litigation matters which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes. Change in Accounting Principle We adopted FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), on January 1, 2002. As part of the adoption of FAS 142, we are required to test goodwill on at least an annual basis. We performed a January 1, 2005 impairment test during the first quarter and concluded that goodwill is not impaired. Effective September 30, 2005, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test to the fourth quarter based on actual data through October 1st. The Company determined this change in accounting principle is preferable because it will allow management to incorporate this test into the normal flow of the financial planning and reporting cycle and provide more timely analysis on the recoverability of goodwill. Our fourth quarter 2005 impairment test also concluded that goodwill is not impaired. 57 Table of Contents Results of Operations Assurant Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 6,520,796 $ 6,482,871 $ 6,156,772 Net investment income 687,257 634,749 607,313 Net realized gains on investments 8,235 24,308 1,868 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 42,508 57,632 68,277 Loss on disposal of businesses (9,232 ) Fees and other income 238,879 220,386 241,988 Total revenues 7,497,675 7,410,714 7,076,218 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (3,707,809 ) (3,839,769 ) (3,657,763 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses(1) (3,073,000 ) (2,976,436 ) (2,839,143 ) Interest expense (61,258 ) (56,418 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2,163 ) (114,133 ) Premium on redemption of preferred securities (205,822 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (6,842,067 ) (6,874,786 ) (6,816,861 ) Income before income taxes 655,608 535,928 259,357 Income taxes (176,253 ) (185,368 ) (73,705 ) Net income $ 479,355 $ 350,560 $ 185,652 (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. The following discussion provides a high level analysis of how the consolidated results were affected by our four operating business segments and our Corporate and Other segment. Please see the results of operations discussion for each of these segments contained in this document for more detailed analysis of the fluctuations. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net income increased $128,795, or 37%, to $479,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $350,560 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses net of reinsurance, improved loss experience absent catastrophes and increased net earned premiums in Assurant Solutions Specialty Property business. Also adding to this increase was a lower benefit loss ratio in Assurant Healths small employer group business and the release of previously provided tax accruals due to the resolution of IRS audits in Corporate and Other. Offsetting these increases was a strengthening of reserve accruals on certain excess of loss reinsurance programs sold by our subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997 in Corporate and Other. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net income increased $164,908, or 89%, to $350,560 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $185,652 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily driven by a non recurring interest premium on the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 2003. Also contributing to 58 Table of Contents the increase were strong sales and a lower benefit loss ratio in individual markets business in Assurant Health. Offsetting these increases were higher catastrophe losses in Assurant Solutions.

(4) Extended Service Contracts includes warranty contracts for products such as personal computers, consumer electronics and appliances. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $115,162, or 91%, to $241,320 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $126,158 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment net income is 59 Table of Contents primarily attributable to lower catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, improved loss experience absent catastrophe losses, and higher net earned premiums in the Specialty Property business. Growth in the Consumer Protection business also contributed to the improved underwriting results as well as increases in fee income and investment income. Net income was also positively impacted by approximately $11,100 after tax primarily related to the release of certain accrued commissions and claims payable associated with three clients, two of which previously declared bankruptcy. We favorably settled many of our claims with these clients during the year. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $207,663, or 7%, to $2,984,973 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $2,777,310 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $164,373 or 7%. Net earned premiums and other considerations from the Specialty Property business increased by $89,981, or 12%, primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums in our creditor placed homeowners insurance products. This was partially offset by a reduction in net earned premiums of approximately $26,000, due to additional reinstatement reinsurance premiums related to the hurricanes. Net earned premiums and other considerations from the Consumer Protection business increased by $74,392, or 4%, primarily from higher net earned premiums in our extended service contract and international products, partially offset by the continued decline of our domestic credit insurance products. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in net investment income of $19,611 or 11%. The increase was a result of an increase in the average portfolio yield of 10 basis points to 4.88% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, from 4.78% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and average invested assets increased by approximately 8%. Approximately $7,300 of the increase in net investment income was due to non recurring items in 2005. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fees and other income of $23,679, or 16%, mainly due to an increase in fee income related to growth from extended service contract and debt deferment products. We experienced growth in all of our core product groupings, with the exception of our domestic credit insurance products. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit insurance products decreased by $85,545, or 10%, due to the continued decline of this product line. See Item 1 Business Operating Business Segments Assurant Solutions. Gross written premiums from our international credit products increased by $52,821, or 9%, due to our focus on international expansion. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract products increased by $159,875, or 17%, due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract products increased by $174,403, or over 100%, mainly due to the signing of a new client in Canada in late 2004. Gross written premiums from the Specialty Property products increased by $154,984, or 12%, primarily due to growth in our creditor placed homeowners insurance products from existing and new clients. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $26,742 or 1%, to $2,620,575 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $2,593,833 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses offset by a decrease in policyholder benefits. The decrease in policyholder benefits of $56,713, or 6%, is primarily attributable to $44,000 in lower catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance in 2005 versus 2004. We incurred losses from catastrophes, net of reinsurance, of $48,700 in 2005, compared to $93,100 in 2004. The decrease was a result of the different severity of gross losses from each storm and the change in composition of our reinsurance coverage in 2005. Additionally, we were reimbursed approximately $18,500 of loss adjustment expenses from the National Flood Insurance Program for providing processing and adjudication services. This reimbursement reduced policyholder benefits expense. We continued to see improvement in our overall Specialty Property loss ratio in 2005, excluding catastrophe losses, in addition to a one time reduction of claims payable of $5,700 associated with a client that previously declared bankruptcy. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $48,581 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues, partially offset by lower premium taxes attributable to the change in the mix of business, and a $11,400 reduction of commission liabilities as a result of favorable 60 Table of Contents settlements with two clients. General expenses increased by $34,875 due to growth in the business, expenses relating to the 2005 hurricane season, including guaranty fund assessments and Sarbanes Oxley expenses. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 Net Income Segment net income decreased by $7,031, or 5%, to $126,158 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $133,189 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in segment income is primarily attributable to higher catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, partially offset by improved loss experience absent catastrophe losses, and higher net earned premiums in the specialty property business. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $89,158, or 3%, to $2,777,310 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $2,688,152 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $86,826, or 4%. Net earned premiums and other considerations from the Specialty Property business increased by $36,261, or 5%, primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners insurance products, partially offset by lower net earned premium in our manufactured housing products, primarily from the overall decline of the manufactured housing sales. Net earned premiums and other considerations from the consumer protection business increased by $50,565, or 3%, primarily from higher net earned premiums in our extended service contract and international products, partially offset by the continued decline of our domestic credit insurance products. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fees and other income of $4,231, or 3%, mainly due to an increase in fee income related to growth from extended service contract and debt deferment products. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $94,399, or 4%, to $2,593,833 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $2,499,434 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $36,202, or 4%. The increase in policyholder benefits is primarily attributable to higher catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $63,300 in 2004 versus 2003. We incurred losses from catastrophes, net of reinsurance, of $93,100 in 2004, compared to $29,800 in 2003. Additionally, excluding catastrophe losses, we experienced decreased losses in the Specialty Property business due to improved loss experience absent the catastrophes. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $13,261 which is consistent with the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $44,936, primarily due to the increased business from our extended service contracts, international, and creditor placed homeowners insurance products. Additionally, in 2004 we incurred Sarbanes Oxley related expenses and an increase in the guaranty fund assessments attributable to the four hurricanes. 61 Table of Contents Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,163,965 $ 2,231,298 $ 2,009,248 Net investment income 69,056 67,902 49,430 Fees and other income 40,344 38,708 32,255 Total revenues 2,273,365 2,337,908 2,090,933 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (1,344,624 ) (1,422,783 ) (1,317,046 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (657,899 ) (674,907 ) (589,283 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,002,523 ) (2,097,690 ) (1,906,329 ) Segment income before income tax 270,842 240,218 184,604 Income taxes (92,787 ) (81,931 ) (63,591 ) Segment income after tax $ 178,055 $ 158,287 $ 121,013 Net earned premiums and other considerations: Individual markets: Individual medical 1,164,498 1,100,868 930,075 Short term medical 110,912 114,583 106,236 Subtotal 1,275,410 1,215,451 1,036,311 Small employer group: 888,555 1,015,847 972,937 Total 2,163,965 2,231,298 2,009,248 Membership by product line: Individual markets: Individual medical 644 675 638 Short term medical 102 107 123 Subtotal 746 782 761 Small employer group: 255 333 376 Total 1,001 1,115 1,137 Ratios: Loss ratio(1) 62.1 % 63.8 % 65.6 % Expense ratio(2) 29.8 % 29.7 % 28.9 % Combined ratio(3) 90.8 % 92.4 % 93.3 % (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $19,768, or 12%, to $178,055 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $158,287 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily 62 Table of Contents attributable to an improved benefit loss ratio in the small employer group business. The increase is partially offset by two items. First, an overall decline in membership due to continued increased competition and strict adherence to our underwriting guidelines. Second, an increase in expenses of approximately $10,000 due to increased spending on initiatives aimed at growing the individual markets business. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $64,543, or 3%, to $2,273,365 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,337,908 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased by $59,959, or 5%, primarily due to premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in members. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased by $127,291, or 13%, due to a decline in members, partially offset by premium rate increases. Both individual markets and the small employer group business continue to experience decreases in new business due to increased competition in their respective markets and strict adherence to our underwriting guidelines. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $95,167, or 5%, to $2,002,523 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,097,690 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The benefit loss ratio decreased by 170 basis points, from 63.8% to 62.1%. The improvement in the benefit loss ratio is due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $78,159, or 5%, primarily due to the overall decline in members and favorable claims experience in the small employer group business. The expense ratio increased by 10 basis points, from 29.7% to 29.8%. The increase in the expense ratio is primarily due to a proportionately smaller decrease in expenses compared to the decrease in net earned premiums and fees and other income. Selling, general and underwriting expenses decreased by $17,008, or 3%, primarily due to a decline in first year business in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting in decreased commission expense and other acquisition costs in both individual markets and small employer group business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $10,000 in spending on initiatives aimed at growing the individual markets business. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Income Segment net income increased by $37,274, or 31%, to $158,287 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $121,013 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net income is primarily attributable to an increase in individual markets business, investment income and an improved benefit loss ratio in the individual markets business, partially offset by a decline in members in the small employer group business. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $246,975, or 12%, to $2,337,908 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $2,090,933 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $222,050, or 11%. Net earned premium growth in the individual markets business was attributable to continued sales growth, which partially reflects the success of HSAs that were introduced on January 1, 2004, and premium rate increases. Net earned premium growth in our small employer group business was attributable to premium rate increases partially offset by decreases in membership. Net investment income increased by $18,472, or 37%, primarily due to an increase in average invested assets of approximately 39%, partially offset by a decline in the average portfolio yield. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $191,361, or 10%, to $2,097,690 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,906,329 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The benefit loss ratio decreased by 180 basis points, from 65.6% to 63.8%. This improvement was attributable to favorable loss experience predominantly on individual markets business, as well as a higher mix of individual markets business compared 63 Table of Contents to small employer group health business in 2004. Policyholder benefits increased by $105,737, or 8%, primarily due to increased sales partially offset by the favorable loss experience. The expense ratio increased by 80 basis points, from 28.9% to 29.7%.

Net Income Segment net income increased by $6,156, or 10%, to $68,366 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $62,210 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment income was primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits. This decrease was driven by improved group life mortality and improved group dental experience, partially offset by lower group disability claim closures. 64 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues remained relatively flat increasing $5,105 to $1,460,941 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,455,836 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations remained flat compared to prior year due to our increased focus on small case and voluntary business. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in net investment income of $7,171, or 5%. During the third quarter, we recognized $2,560 of investment income from a real estate partnership. The remaining increase in net investment income is primarily due to an increase in average invested assets of approximately 3%. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $4,595, or less than 1%, to $1,355,377 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,359,972 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss ratio decreased 110 basis points, from 74.4% to 73.3%. The decrease in the loss ratio and the decrease in policyholder benefits of $13,400, or 1%, was primarily due to improved group life mortality and improved group dental experience partially offset by lower group disability claim closures. The expense ratio increased 70 basis points, from 31.4% to 32.1%. The increase in the expense ratio is due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $8,805, or 2%, primarily driven by higher technology related costs due to implementation of technology aimed at improving our customer service. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Income Segment net income increased by $643, or 1%, to $62,210 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $61,567 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The slight increase in segment net income was due to a net decrease in expense driven by the sale of the WorkAbility division in 2004. See Corporate and Other. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $5,657, or less than 1%, to $1,455,836 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,450,179 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total revenues is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations and net investment income, partially offset by a decrease in fee income. Net earned premium growth of $20,382, or 2%, was driven by an increase in disability premiums written through alternate distribution sources as well as the transition of a block of business from administrative fee only business to fully insured business. Net investment income increased $9,762, or 7%. This is primarily due to an increase in average invested assets of approximately 10%, partially offset by a decrease in the average portfolio yield. The decrease in fee income was primarily due to the sale of the WorkAbility division. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $5,832, or less than 1%, to $1,359,972 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,354,140 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The loss ratio increased 110 basis points from 73.3% to 74.4%. The increase in loss ratio was primarily driven by a reduction in reserves in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for group disability, group life, and group dental products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant by $17,915. Therefore, we reduced reserves by $17,915 in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these estimates. Also contributing to the increase was poor experience on a single large disability case and deterioration in group dental experience, partially offset by lower group disability incidence and improved group life mortality experience. The expense ratio decreased by 170 basis points from 33.1%, to 31.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by the sale of the WorkAbility division as well as the writedown of previously capitalized software in 2003, not incurred in 2004. 65 Table of Contents Assurant PreNeed Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant PreNeeds segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 465,979 $ 526,120 $ 529,279 Net investment income 228,956 206,300 188,224 Fees and other income 3,492 6,810 5,315 Total revenues 698,427 739,230 722,818 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (485,689 ) (531,320 ) (520,540 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (158,647 ) (156,486 ) (146,942 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (644,336 ) (687,806 ) (667,482 ) Segment income before income tax 54,091 51,424 55,336 Income taxes (19,037 ) (17,189 ) (19,314 ) Segment income after tax $ 35,054 $ 34,235 $ 36,022 Net earned premiums and other considerations by channel: AMLIC (1) $ 249,835 $ 273,148 $ 283,271 Independent United States 190,548 234,175 231,596 Independent Canada 25,596 18,797 14,412 Total $ 465,979 $ 526,120 $ 529,279 (1) American Memorial Life Insurance Company Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004. Net Income Segment net income increased by $819, or 2%, to $35,054 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $34,235 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was principally due to an increase in investment income. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which increased policyholder benefits and decreased the value of our CPI Cap. Also, severance and related costs increased due to the sale of the Independent United States distribution. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $40,803, or 6%, to $698,427 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $739,230 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net earned premiums and other considerations of $60,141, or 11%. The sale of the Independent United States distribution in November 2005 accounted for $19,507 of the decrease, with the remainder of the decrease due to an overall decline in sales of life policies. Independent United States sales have declined as a result of continued pricing discipline on certain new business, resulting in the loss of several large customers prior to the sale. Sales at AMLIC have declined due to changes in the sales force structure at SCI, AMLICs principal customer. Independent Canada life sales declined due to a shift to annuity sales. Overall life and annuity sales in Independent Canada increased due to expansion into Quebec and growth in sales through corporate owned funeral homes. The overall decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in net investment income of 66 Table of Contents $22,656, or 11%, primarily due to an increase in invested assets of 5% and $9,409 of investment income from a real estate partnership. Additionally, fees and other income decreased $3,318, or 49%, primarily due to a decrease in the value of the CPI Cap. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $43,470, or 6%, to $644,336 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $687,806 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $45,631, or 9%, due to the sale of the Independent United States distribution and a decline in sales of life policies. These declines were offset by higher crediting paid on CPI indexed products. The decrease was also offset by an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $2,161, primarily due to severance and costs related to the sale of the Independent United States distribution of approximately $5,800, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred costs related to the Independent United States channel and lower premium taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Income Segment net income decreased by $1,787, or 5%, to $34,235 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $36,022 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was principally due to a decline in investment yields offset by a reduction of crediting rates on certain new business. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $16,412, or 2%, to $739,230 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $722,818 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net investment income of $18,076, or 10%, due to an increase in the average invested assets of approximately 14%, partially offset by a decrease in the average portfolio yield of 23 basis points to 6.34% for 2004 from 6.57% for 2003. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $20,324, or 3%, to $687,806 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $667,482 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $10,780, or 2%, due to the sale of new business partially offset by a reduction of crediting rates on certain business of approximately $5,300 and an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $9,544, or 6%, primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in mix of new business sales to more single pay sales. Corporate and Other Overview The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held, interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments and additional costs associated with excess of loss reinsurance programs reinsured and ceded to certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the sales of the FFG and LTC businesses. 67 Table of Contents The table below presents information regarding the Corporate and Other segments results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenues: Net investment income $ 27,794 $ 25,878 $ 42,853 Net realized gains on investments 8,235 24,308 1,868 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of Businesses 42,508 57,632 68,277 Loss on disposal of businesses (9,232 ) Fees and other income 1,432 1,844 11,138 Total revenues 79,969 100,430 124,136 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (61,943 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (96,055 ) (76,904 ) (69,521 ) Interest expense (61,258 ) (56,418 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2,163 ) (114,133 ) Premium on redemption of preferred securities (205,822 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (219,256 ) (135,485 ) (389,476 ) Segment (loss) before income tax (139,287 ) (35,055 ) (265,340 ) Income taxes 95,847 4,725 99,201 Segment (loss) after tax $ (43,440 ) $ (30,330 ) $ (166,139 ) As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $287,212 (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (The Hartford) and John Hancock Life Insurance Company (John Hancock), now a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net loss increased by $13,110, or 43%, to $(43,440) for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $(30,330) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits due to the strengthening of reserve accruals on certain excess of loss reinsurance programs sold by our subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997, an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses due to stock compensation and a reduction in the amortization of deferred gains on disposal of business. The increase in net loss was partially offset by approximately $39,400 of income tax accrual releases due to the resolution of IRS audits. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $20,461, or 20%, to $79,969 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $100,430 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower net realized gains on investments and lower amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses due to continued runoff of the sold businesses. In addition, as a result of our annual review of estimates affecting the deferred gain on disposal of businesses we took a charge of approximately $4,600. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $83,771, or 62%, to $219,256 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $135,485 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily due to an 68 Table of Contents increase in policyholder benefits of $61,943, or 100%, as a result of costs incurred on excess of loss reinsurance programs, related to personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks, reinsured and ceded by certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. These charges include a settlement with one of our largest reinsurers for 1997 and strengthening of reserves for remaining portions of the program. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $19,151, or 25%, primarily due to stock appreciation rights (SARs), which increased by $18,000 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of appreciation in the stock price. Income Taxes The income tax benefits increased by $91,122 to $95,847 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $4,725 for the year end December 31, 2004. Approximately $39,400 of the increased benefit was primarily due to the release of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of IRS audits. In addition, approximately $5,500 of the increased benefit was due to a recaptured tax benefit from the $19,000 of tax expense we incurred in 2004 on the repatriation of capital from Puerto Rico, primarily due to a technical correction of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Income Segment net loss decreased by $135,809, or 82%, to $(30,330) for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $(166,139) for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to non recurring interest premium of $205,822 on the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 2003 and the reduction in distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities due to the redemption of the securities in December 2003 and January 2004. Also, net investment income declined due to lower average invested assets and lower interest rates. These declines were partially offset by the increase in interest expense due to the issuance of senior notes in February 2004 and the increase in net realized gains on investments. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $23,706, or 19%, to $100,430 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $124,136 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decreased is primarily due to reductions in net investment income due to the lower average invested assets and lower interest rates, reductions in amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses and the loss incurred on disposal of the WorkAbility division of $9,232. These declines were partially offset by the increase in net realized gains on investments of $22,440 as a result of fewer other than temporary impairments in 2004. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $253,991, or 65%, to $135,485 for the year ended December 31, 2004, from $389,476 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and the interest premium on the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities incurred in 2003 as a result of the early redemption of the securities in December 2003 and January 2004. These declines were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of senior notes in February 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Income taxes The income tax benefit decreased by $94,476, to $4,725 for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $99,201 for the year ended December 31, 2003. In December of 2004, pursuant to the Jobs Act, we repatriated $110,000 of capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred approximately $19,000 of tax expense. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of the Federal Tax liability resulted in a $10,000 reduction of our tax liability. 69 Table of Contents Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 (in thousands) Fixed maturities $ 8,961,778 72 % $ 9,009,290 74 % Equity securities 693,101 5 % 637,738 5 % Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1,212,006 10 % 1,053,872 9 % Policy loans 61,043 1 % 64,886 1 % Short term investments 427,474 3 % 300,093 2 % Collateral held under securities lending 610,662 5 % 535,331 4 % Other investments 549,759 4 % 546,836 5 % Total investments $ 12,515,823 100 % $ 12,148,046 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 66% and 67% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. As interest rates increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities decreases. The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (losses), pre tax, on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2005 As of December 31, 2004 Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,668,595 $ 8,517,654 Net unrealized gains 293,183 491,636 Fair value $ 8,961,778 $ 9,009,290 Equities: Cost $ 694,977 $ 617,864 Net unrealized (losses) gains (1,876 ) 19,874 Fair value $ 693,101 $ 637,738 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased by $198,453, or 40%, to December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased by $21,750, or 109%, to December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004. The decrease in net unrealized gains was primarily due to an increase in treasury yield. The yield on 5 year treasury securities increased by approximately 72 basis points and the yield on 10 year treasury securities increased by 14 basis points between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005. We recorded $765, $600, and $20,271 of pre tax realized losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, associated with other than temporary declines in value of available for sale securities. We also recorded zero, $4,217, and $11,125 of pre tax realized losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, associated with other investments. 70 Table of Contents The investment category and duration of our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Less than 12 months 12 Months or More Total Fair Value UnrealizedLosses Fair Value UnrealizedLosses Fair Value UnrealizedLosses Fixed maturities Bonds: United States Government and government agencies and authorities $ 67,135 $ (591 ) $ 18,471 $ (547 ) $ 85,606 $ (1,138 ) States, municipalities and political subdivisions 6,521 (44 ) 12,179 (234 ) 18,700 (278 ) Foreign governments 142,116 (2,081 ) 10,142 (469 ) 152,258 (2,550 ) Public utilities 240,259 (5,358 ) 36,752 (1,135 ) 277,011 (6,493 ) All other corporate bonds 1,611,483 (28,926 ) 131,084 (5,383 ) 1,742,567 (34,309 ) Mortgage Back Securities 768,920 (9,108 ) 128,663 (4,197 ) 897,583 (13,305 ) Total fixed maturities $ 2,836,434 $ (46,108 ) $ 337,291 $ (11,965 ) $ 3,173,725 $ (58,073 ) Equity securities Common stocks: Banks, trusts and insurance companies $ 10 $ (1 ) $ $ $ 10 $ (1 ) Industrial, miscellaneous and all other 55 (44 ) 55 (44 ) Non redeemable preferred stocks: Non sinking fund preferred stocks 307,918 (7,468 ) 71,798 (4,286 ) 379,716 (11,754 ) Total equity securities $ 307,983 $ (7,513 ) $ 71,798 $ (4,286 ) $ 379,781 $ (11,799 ) The total unrealized losses represent less than 2% of the aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately 77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 1,172 individual securities with 94% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $200. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for longer than six months but less than 12 months was approximately $9,388, with no security with a book value of greater than $1,000 having a market value below 79% of book value. As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and recorded $765, $600 and $20,271 of additional other than temporary impairments as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Due to issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2005 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. 71 Table of Contents Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions To exit certain businesses, we have used reinsurance to facilitate transactions because the businesses share legal entities with business segments we retain. Assets supporting liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts and the separate accounts relating to divested business are still reflected in our balance sheet. Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full statutory financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2006, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval for our statutory subsidiaries, is approximately $292,300. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $530,094 for the year ended December 31, 2005, $361,700 for the year ended December 31, 2004, and $99,500 for the year ended December 31, 2003. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, and to repurchase our outstanding shares. 72 Table of Contents The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. We paid dividends of $0.08 per common share on March 7, 2006 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2006. We paid dividends of $0.08 per common share on June 7, 2005, September 7, 2005 and December 12, 2005. We paid dividends of $0.07 per common share on June 7, 2004, September 7, 2004, December 7, 2004, and March 14, 2005. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries payment of dividends and or other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Our qualified pension plan was under funded by $40,612 at December 31, 2005. We contributed $40,000 as of September 30, 2005. We made an additional $6,500 contribution in December 2005. See Note 20 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the components of the net periodic benefit cost. The Company maintains a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our commercial paper program is rated AMB 2 by A.M. Best, P 2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. In April 2005, we amended and restated our $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase Bank. The amended and restated credit facility is unsecured and is available until April 2010, so long as the Company is in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at December 31, 2005. We did not use the revolving credit facility during 2005 and no amounts are outstanding. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. We are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. Our senior notes are rated bbb by A.M. Best, Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by S&P. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The senior notes are our unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. 73 Table of Contents The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,020,152 $ 832,407 $ 718,684 Investing activities (668,023 ) (756,464 ) (732,745 ) Financing activities (303,642 ) (227,058 ) 361,564 Net change in cash $ 48,487 $ (151,115 ) $ 347,503 Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Financing Activities: The key change of the net cash outflow of $303,642 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to net cash outflow of $227,058 for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock of $342,148 in 2005 compared to $63,628 in 2004 offset by a change in collateral held under securities lending of $75,331 in 2005 compared to $114,549 in 2004, issuance of common stock of $5,404 in 2005 compared to $725,491 in 2004, and net repayment of debt of zero in 2005 compared to $778,463 in 2004. The key changes of the net cash outflow of $227,058 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to net cash inflow of $361,564 for the year ended December 31, 2003 were primarily due to a net repayment of debt of 74 Table of Contents $778,463 for 2004 compared to a net issuance of debt of $1,750,000 in 2003 offset by a change in repayment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of $196,224 in 2004 compared to $1,249,850 in 2003.

These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2005, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5Years Total (in thousands) Contractual obligations: Insurance liabilities (1) $ 1,658,310 $721,434 $358,972 $ 902,953 $3,641,669 Debt and related interest 60,188 180,563 180,563 1,676,438 2,097,752 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 24,160 24,160 Operating leases 33,698 47,278 32,241 35,837 149,054 Pension obligations: 23,543 51,217 57,098 200,065 331,923 Commitments: Investment purchases outstanding: unsettled trades 175,758 175,758 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 79,594 79,594 Other investments 15,254 1,638 16,892 Total obligations and commitments $ 2,046,615 $ 1,002,130 $ 628,874 $ 2,839,453 $ 6,517,072 (1) Insurance liabilities, reflected in the commitments and contingencies table above, include products for which we are currently making periodic payments and products for which we are not making periodic payments, but for which we believe the amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and determinable. Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The total amount represents the claims and benefits payable on all of our long and short duration contracts with the exception of $233,554 related to our FFG and LTC disposed businesses. The payment of these liabilities has been fully reinsured. Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of $6,664,854 and unearned premiums of $3,851,614 as of December 31, 2005 have been excluded from the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above because the determination of these liability amounts and the timing of payments are not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event, payment triggering or revenue recognition event has not yet occurred. 75 Table of Contents Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $28,216 and $65,607 of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. 76 Table of Contents Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity relating to price risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the yield curves. We have assumed that the United States and Canadian yield curve shifts are of equal direction and magnitude. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as callable bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2005 100 50 0 50 100 (in thousands) Total market value $ 9,536,771 $ 9,243,964 $ 8,961,778 $ 8,691,444 $ 8,432,396 % Change in market value from base case 6.42 % 3.15 % % (3.02 )% (5.77 )% $ Change in market value from base case $ 574,993 $ 282,185 $ $ (270,335 ) $ (529,382 ) The interest rate sensitivity relating to reinvestment risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume purchases in the primary market and considers the effects of interest rates on sales. The effects of embedded options including call or put features are not considered. Our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis on our reported portfolio yield: Interest Rate Movement Analysis Of Portfolio Yield of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2005 100 50 0 50 100 Portfolio Yield 5.51 % 5.57 % 5.64 % 5.71 % 5.77 % Basis Point Change in Portfolio Yield (0.13 )% (0.07 )% % 0.07 % 0.13 % Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for 77 Table of Contents certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. See Item 1 Business Investments. The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2005: Rating Fair Value Percentage ofTotal (in thousands) Aaa/Aa/A $ 5,942,285 66 % Baa 2,412,570 27 % Ba 460,831 5 % B and lower 146,093 2 % Total $8,961,778 100 % We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $4,447,811 of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2005, we are protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,444,992 and $995,488 as of December 31, 2005 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. We believe that a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated A or better by A.M. Best. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 12% of Assurant PreNeeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $405,000 as of December 31, 2005 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing contracts with payments tied to the CPI. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily the 78 Table of Contents British pound and Danish krone. However, total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 5% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2005. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets denominated in Canadian dollars on our entire fixed maturity portfolio is summarize in the following table: Foreign Exchange Movement Analysis Of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Assets As of December 31, 2005 Foreign exchange spot rate at December 31,2005, US Dollar to Canadian Dollar 10% 5% 0 5% 10% Total market value $ 8,899,599 $ 8,930,688 $ 8,961,778 $ 8,992,868 $ 9,023,957 % change of market value from base case (0.69 )% (0.35 )% % 0.35 % 0.69 % $ change of market value from base case $ (62,179 ) $ (31,090 ) $ $ 31,090 $ 62,179 The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our consolidated net income is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume earnings in Canadian dollars are recognized evenly throughout a period. Our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology.

Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. We have purchased contracts to cap the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our pre funded funeral insurance policies. In 2003, we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative 79 Table of Contents (i.e., total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
