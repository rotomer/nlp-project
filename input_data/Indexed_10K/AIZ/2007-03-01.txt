Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General On April 1, 2006, the Company separated its Assurant Solutions business segment into two business segments: Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property. In addition, concurrent with the creation of the new Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property segments, the Company realigned the Preneed segment under the new Assurant Solutions segment. Segment income statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 have been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure. We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held, interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments, run off Asbestos business, and additional costs associated with excess of loss reinsurance and ceded to certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. Therefore, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 40 Table of Contents Revenues We generate our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions domestic credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products, from which we earned premium revenue, to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decease with interest rates. We also have investments that carry pre payment risk, such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities. Actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from estimates at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. Therefore, we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. Expenses Our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting and general expenses and interest expense. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting policyholder benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future policyholder benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management catastrophe reinsurance coverage and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had $993,934 and $995,850, respectively of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. This has had an impact on our annual interest and dividend costs. 41 Table of Contents Dispositions of Businesses Our results of operations were affected by the following dispositions: On November 9, 2005, the Company signed an agreement with Forethought to sell via reinsurance new preneed insurance polices written as of October 1, 2005 in the United States via independent funeral homes and funeral home chains other than those owned and operated by SCI. The Company will receive payments from Forethought over the next ten years based on the amount of business the Company transitions to Forethought. This agreement does not impact preneeds Independent Canada operation or SCI distribution channels. On May 3, 2004, we sold the assets of our WorkAbility division of CORE, Inc. (CORE). We recorded a pre tax loss on the sale of $9,232, which was included in the Corporate and Other segment. Critical Accounting Estimates There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Item 1A. Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Reserves Reserves are established according to GAAP using generally accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liabilities and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. 42 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 FuturePolicyBenefits andExpenses UnearnedPremiums CaseReserve IncurredBut NotReportedReserves FuturePolicyBenefits andExpenses UnearnedPremiums CaseReserve IncurredBut NotReportedReserves Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 3,031,487 $ 3,339 $ 10,599 $ 3,094 $ 2,902,918 $ 3,616 $ 11,476 $ 3,443 Life insurance no longer offered 502,406 784 1,356 467 513,426 820 1,612 517 Universal life and other products no longer offered 331,257 1,537 263 8,289 346,928 1,699 339 7,128 FFG and LTC disposed businesses 2,743,154 45,129 262,960 34,743 2,724,575 46,956 218,311 15,243 Medical 152,954 23,827 34,454 43,602 172,441 31,650 50,866 45,926 All other 5,085 504 11,532 7,213 4,566 608 8,548 7,926 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 6,787 327,180 53,221 6,207 331,040 58,953 Group disability 2,195 1,362,594 156,296 2,110 1,330,091 168,825 Medical 95,651 123,736 192,394 89,776 143,379 180,727 Dental 3,796 4,746 19,873 4,226 4,631 23,332 Property and Warranty 1,488,253 195,306 296,336 1,261,145 415,654 531,364 Credit Life and Disability 494,113 125,909 93,261 571,723 154,964 120,279 Extended Service Contract 2,179,345 3,075 32,462 1,784,292 6,726 27,900 All other 84,633 3,251 3,954 46,786 3,694 2,329 Total $ 6,766,343 $ 4,429,893 $ 2,466,961 $ 945,205 $ 6,664,854 $ 3,851,614 $ 2,681,331 $ 1,193,892 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Long Duration Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company experience and include provision for possible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Risks related to the reserves recorded for contracts from FFG and LTC disposed businesses have been 100% ceded via reinsurance. While the Company has not been released from the contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic and mortality assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect the Company unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer. We have sold these businesses through reinsurance. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum 43 Table of Contents liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. Historically, loss recognition testing has not resulted in an adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated. Short Duration For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are reported when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group long term disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim recovery rates, claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. Claims and Benefits Payable Claims and Benefits Payable Group disability, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points $1,589,249 Group disability, claim termination rate 10% lower $1,570,982 Group disability, as reported $1,518,890 Group disability, as reported $1,518,890 Group disability, discount rate increased by 100 basis points $1,452,698 Group disability, claim termination rate 10% higher $1,470,360 The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. Claims and Benefits Payable Group term life, discount rate decreased by 100 basis points $ 388,123 Group term life, as reported $ 380,401 Group life, discount rate increased by 100 basis points $ 372,212 Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and the primary methods we use in their estimation are the loss development method 44 Table of Contents and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. Under the loss development method, we estimate ultimate losses for each incident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. Under the projected claim method, we use ultimate loss ratios when development methods do not provide enough data to reliably estimate reserves. In addition, we use variations on each method as well as a blend of the two. The primary variation is the use of projected claims using differing experience periods. We primarily use these two methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. We develop the best estimate of expected outstanding liabilities for medical IBNR reserves using generally accepted actuarial principles. The various product lines are evaluated using experience data of sufficient detail to allow for the compilation of historical loss patterns including but not limited to claim lag factors, projected claims per member and restated development factors. If sufficient experience data is not available, experience data from other similar blocks may be used. Industry data as well as data from consulting actuaries provide additional benchmarks when historical experience is too limited. This information is used to provide a range in which the expected outstanding liabilities may fall. The selection of the ultimate loss estimate varies by product line as the credibility of certain methods differs depending upon the in force volume, the products claim volatility and the method itself. The selection is also influenced by other available information that may indicate that historical experience data may not be appropriate to use for current liability estimates. Examples of such information include but are not limited to changes in claims inventory levels, changes in provider negotiated rates or cost savings initiatives, increasing or decreasing medical cost trends, product changes and demographic changes in the underlying insured population. The development of prior period estimates are also reviewed to assist in establishing the current periods loss reserves. The short claim lag time inherent in many of our Medical products allows for emerging trends to be identified quickly. We evaluate all pertinent information and indicated ranges using experience and actuarial judgment to establish our best estimate for the associated liabilities. A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. Claims and Benefits Payable Medical, loss development factors 1% lower $ 342,130 * Medical, as reported $ 316,130 Medical, loss development factors 1% higher $ 295,130 * This refers to loss development factors for the most recent four months. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 84% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty We develop the best estimate of loss reserves for our Property and Warranty line of business on a product line basis using generally accepted actuarial principles. Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves, IBNR and development on 45 Table of Contents case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. The loss development method involves aggregating loss data (paid losses and case incurred losses) by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age in quarters (or years) for each product or product grouping. As the data ages, we compile loss development factors that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting the most appropriate loss development factors, we project the known losses to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The data is analyzed at a minimum using four different loss development methods by product or product grouping: a) annual paid losses, b) annual case incurred losses, c) quarterly paid losses and d) quarterly case incurred losses. Also, in addition to the above, some product groupings are analyzed using the expected loss ratio and Bornhuetter Ferguson loss development methods. Each of these reserve methodologies produces an indication of the loss reserves for the product or product grouping. The process to select the best estimate differs across lines of business. The single best estimate is determined based on many factors, including but not limited to: the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions, the quality and applicability of historical data whether it be internal or industry data, current and future market conditions the economic environment will often impact the development of loss triangles, the extent of data segmentation data should be homogenous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply, and the past variability of loss estimates the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others. We review operational and claims activity to gather additional pertinent information. After reviewing all additional pertinent information, a final IBNR amount for each product grouping is selected. We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate of Property and Warranty reserves is generally selected from the middle to upper end of the third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits management to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in our results of operations. While management has used its best judgment in establishing its estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. 46 Table of Contents If the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves will be different than managements estimate. The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity levels on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2006 would be as follows: Change in both loss frequency and severity for all Property and Warranty Ultimate cost of claims occurring in 2006 Change in cost of claims occurring in 2006 3% higher $ 521,724 $ 29,949 2% higher $ 511,643 $ 19,868 1% higher $ 501,660 $ 9,885 Base scenario $ 491,642 $ 1% lower $ 481,890 $ (9,885 ) 2% lower $ 471,907 $ (19,868 ) 3% lower $ 461,826 $ (29,949 ) Reserving for Asbestos and Other Claims We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We believe the balance of case reserves for these liabilities and bulk reserves for IBNR are adequate. However, any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. One of our subsidiaries, American Reliable Insurance Company (ARIC), participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to retrocessionaires. ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaries, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of the disputes involving ARIC and an affiliate, Bankers Insurance Company Limited (BICL), relating to the 1995 and 1997 program years, have been resolved by settlement or arbitration. As a result of the settlements and an arbitration (in which ARIC did not prevail) additional information became available in 2005, and, based on managements best estimate, we increased our reserves and recorded a total pre tax charge of $61,943 for the year ended December 31, 2005. On February 28, 2006, many of the disputes relating to losses in the 1996 program were settled. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1996 program were adequate. Negotiations, arbitrations and litigation are still ongoing or will be scheduled for the remaining disputes. We believe, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the 47 Table of Contents uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. DAC The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions, including the anticipation of interest income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for pre funded funeral life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. These acquisition costs consist primarily of first year commissions paid to agents and sales and policy issue costs. For pre funded funeral investment type annuities and universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to worksite group disability consist primarily of first year commissions to brokers and one time policy transfer fees and costs of issuing new certificates. These acquisition costs are front end loaded, thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Short Duration Contracts Acquisition costs relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability and group dental consist primarily of compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs are front end loaded; thus, they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical contracts consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation to representatives. 48 Table of Contents These contracts are considered short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these costs are not deferred, but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. The Company monitors its investment portfolio to identify investments that may be other than temporarily impaired. In addition, securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price are added to the impairment watchlist, which is discussed at quarterly meetings attended by members of the Companys investment, accounting and finance departments. Any security whose price decrease is deemed other than temporary is written down to its then current market level with the amount of the writedown reported as a realized loss in that period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are recognized on the specific identification basis. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report and Item 1A Risk Factors Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2006 As ofDecember 31, 2005 (in thousands) Reinsurance recoverables $ 3,914,972 $ 4,447,810 We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,728,216 and $2,440,480 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 49 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 (in thousands) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,635,445 $ 2,565,223 Ceded unearned premium 637,447 691,787 Ceded claims and benefits payable 577,052 928,882 Ceded paid losses 65,028 261,918 Total $ 3,914,972 $ 4,447,810 We utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, client risk and profit sharing. See also Item 7AQuantative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Credit Risk. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. Contingencies We follow the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). This requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is reported if reasonably estimable and probable. We establish reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or, if no one estimated number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, we report an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimated range. Contingencies affecting the Company include litigation matters which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations Assurant Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 6,843,775 $ 6,520,796 $ 6,482,871 Net investment income 736,686 687,257 634,749 Net realized gains on investments 111,865 8,235 24,308 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 37,300 42,508 57,632 Loss on disposal of businesses (9,232 ) Fees and other income 340,958 238,879 220,386 Total revenues 8,070,584 7,497,675 7,410,714 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (3,538,947 ) (3,707,809 ) (3,839,769 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses(1) (3,374,652 ) (3,073,000 ) (2,976,436 ) Interest expense (61,243 ) (61,258 ) (56,418 ) Distributions on preferred securities (2,163 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (6,974,842 ) (6,842,067 ) (6,874,786 ) Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,095,742 655,608 535,928 Income taxes (379,871 ) (176,253 ) (185,368 ) Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 715,871 479,355 350,560 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,547 Net income $ 717,418 $ 479,355 $ 350,560 (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. The following discussion provides a high level analysis of how the consolidated results were affected by our four operating business segments and our Corporate and Other segment. Please see the results of operations discussion for each of these segments contained in this document for more detailed analysis of the fluctuations. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net income increased $238,063, or 50%, to $717,418 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $479,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Assurant Specialty Propertys creditor placed homeowners business net earned premiums, fee income, improved loss experience and the lack of significant catastrophes in 2006. Assurant Solutions also contributed to the increase in net income primarily due to higher fee income from a $40,500 (after tax) legal settlement, growth in the extended service contract business and one time fee income recognized from a closed block of extended service contract business. Corporate and Other also contributed to the increase in net income primarily due to higher net realized gains due to $63,900 (after tax) from the sale of our investment in PHCS. The $1,547 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is a result of adopting FAS 123R and reflects the difference 51 Table of Contents between compensation expense that would have been recognized using actual forfeitures and compensation expense that would have been recognized using expected forfeitures. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net income increased $128,795, or 37%, to $479,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $350,560 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily driven by Assurant Specialty Propertys creditor placed homeowners business with lower net catastrophe losses, improved loss experience absent catastrophes and increased net earned premiums. Assurant Solutions also contributed to the increase in net income primarily due to an increase in net investment income and fee and other income. Also adding to this increase was a lower benefit loss ratio in Assurant Healths small employer group business and the release of previously provided tax accruals due to the resolution of IRS audits in Corporate and Other. Offsetting these increases was a strengthening of reserve accruals of approximately $40,300 (after tax) on certain excess of loss reinsurance programs sold by our subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997 in Corporate and Other. Assurant Solutions Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,371,605 $ 2,220,145 $ 2,205,988 Net investment income 392,510 371,565 318,705 Fees and other income 221,751 132,730 113,515 Total revenues 2,985,866 2,724,440 2,638,208 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (998,770 ) (1,046,900 ) (1,094,884 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (1,689,776 ) (1,477,505 ) (1,413,562 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (2,688,546 ) (2,524,405 ) (2,508,446 ) Segment income before income tax 297,320 200,035 129,762 Income taxes (98,427 ) (66,888 ) (39,044 ) Segment income after tax $ 198,893 $ 133,147 $ 90,718 Gross written premiums for selected product groupings: (1) Domestic Credit $ 714,791 $ 767,466 $ 853,011 International Credit $ 680,097 $ 647,467 $ 594,646 Domestic Extended Service Contracts (2) $ 1,258,292 $ 1,120,227 $ 960,352 International Extended Service Contracts (2) $ 341,886 $ 247,506 $ 73,103 Preneed (Face Sales) $ 433,510 $ 542,512 $ 582,197 (1) Gross written premium does not necessarily translate to an equal amount of subsequent net earned premiums since Assurant Solutions reinsures a portion of its premium to insurance subsidiaries of its clients. (2) Extended Service Contracts includes warranty contracts for products such as personal computers, consumer electronics and appliances. 52 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased by $65,746, or 49%, to $198,893 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $133,147 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment net income was primarily due to a legal settlement resulting in $40,500 (after tax) of other income and $5,041 (after tax) of one time fee income recognized from a closed block of extended service contract business. This was partially offset by $3,363 (after tax) of lower investment income from real estate partnerships. Absent these events the Solutions segment net income increased by $23,568, or 18%, which is primarily attributable to higher fee income resulting from growth in our extended service contract business and an increase in investment income primarily due to an increase in average invested assets. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $261,426 or 10%, to $2,985,866 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,724,440 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $151,460. This increase is primarily attributable to higher net earned premiums in our extended service contract and international businesses. These increases are partially offset by the decrease in the net earned premium in our Preneed business due to the sale of the Independent U.S. distribution channel as well as decreases in other runoff businesses. The increase in revenues was also due to an increase in fees and other income of $89,021, primarily driven by a legal settlement of $62,300 and continued growth from our extended service contract business, including $7,756 of one time fee income from a closed block of extended service contract business. The legal settlement is with a former customer and was first disclosed as a pending legal judgment in our 2004 10 K. We are anticipating a reduction in fee income in 2007 due to the loss of a large debt deferment client. This client contributed approximately $18,000 of fee income in 2006. Net investment income increased by $20,945, or 6%, primarily due to higher average invested assets from growth in our extended service contract businesses both domestically and abroad. We experienced sales growth in most of our core product lines, with the exception of our domestic credit and Preneed businesses. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit business decreased by $52,675 due to the continued decline of this product line. Gross written premiums from our international credit business increased by $32,630 due to growth in our expansion countries. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract business increased by $138,065 due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract business increased by $94,380, mainly due to the continued growth of a client signed in late 2004. We also experienced a decrease in our preneed businesses due to the sale of the U.S. Independent distribution channel in November 2005. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $164,141, or 7%, to $2,688,546 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,524,405 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $212,271. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $187,036 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues and the change in the mix of business. Commissions increased due to higher commission rates on our increasing extended service contract business versus lower commission rates on the decreasing U.S. Independent Preneed business. General expenses increased by $25,235 due to higher expenses directly related to the growth of the business. Policyholder benefits decreased by $48,130 primarily as a result of the sale via reinsurance of the U.S. Independent Preneed channel and lower policyholder benefits attributable to the termination of a block of accidental death business. This was offset by an increase in extended service contract policyholder benefits, mostly from growth in the business. 53 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $42,429, or 47%, to $133,147 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $90,718 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment net income is primarily attributable to an increase in investment income driven by the increased invested assets as a result of growth in our domestic and international extended service contract business combined with $6,116 (after tax) of additional investment income from a real estate partnership. The growth in our extended service contract and international products fee income also contributed to an increase in segment net income. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $86,232, or 3%, to $2,724,440 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $2,638,208 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net investment income of $52,860, or 17%. The increase was a result of an increase in the average portfolio yield and average invested assets, combined with income from a real estate partnership transaction of $9,409 and approximately $7,300 of non recurring investment income items in 2005. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in fee income of $19,215, or 17%, mainly due to growth in our extended service contract and debt deferment products. Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by $14,157, or 1%, primarily from higher net earned premiums in our extended service contract and international products, partially offset by the continued decline of our domestic credit insurance products and the decrease in net earned premiums in our Preneed business due to the sale of the Preneed Independent U.S. distribution channel. We experienced sales growth in all of our core product groupings, with the exception of our domestic credit and Preneed businesses. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit products decreased by $85,545, or 10%, due to the continued decline of this product line. Gross written premiums from our international credit products increased by $52,821, or 9%, due to our focus on international expansion. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract products increased by $159,875, or 17%, due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract products increased by $174,403, or over 100%, mainly due to the signing of a new client in Canada in late 2004. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $15,959 or 1%, to $2,524,405 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $2,508,446 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $63,943. Commission, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $45,207 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues, partially offset by lower premium taxes attributable to the change in the mix of business. General expenses increased by $18,736 due to growth in the business, severance and costs related to the sale of the Independent U.S. distribution channel, and increased expenses related to SOX 404. This increase was offset by a decrease in policyholder benefits of $47,984, or 4%, primarily attributable to a decline in policyholder benefits associated with the sale of the Independent U.S. distribution channel. 54 Table of Contents Assurant Specialty Property Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Specialty Propertys segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,208,311 $ 858,848 $ 768,773 Net investment income 74,501 61,953 72,546 Fees and other income 49,424 38,159 37,013 Total revenues 1,332,236 958,960 878,332 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (408,721 ) (317,507 ) (363,926 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (553,452 ) (422,999 ) (401,327 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (962,173 ) (740,506 ) (765,253 ) Segment income before income tax 370,063 218,454 113,079 Income taxes (128,942 ) (75,227 ) (38,138 ) Segment income after tax $ 241,121 $ 143,227 $ 74,941 Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Homeowners (Creditor Placed and Voluntary) $ 753,169 $ 443,526 $ 392,561 Manufacturing Housing (Creditor Placed and Voluntary) 214,461 217,424 210,824 Other(1) 240,681 197,898 165,388 Total $ 1,208,311 $ 858,848 $ 768,773 Ratios: Loss ratio(2) 33.8 % 37.0 % 47.3 % Expense ratio(3) 44.0 % 47.2 % 49.8 % Combined ratio(4) 76.5 % 82.6 % 95.0 % (1) This includes flood, renters, agricultural, specialty auto and other insurance products.

(4) The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased by $97,894, or 68%, to $241,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $143,227 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment net income is primarily due to increased net earned premiums, fee income and improved loss experience in our creditor placed homeowners business, the lack of significant catastrophes in 2006, the acquisition of SFIS and favorable settlements with two former clients of $5,500 (after tax). The increase in net income was partially offset by a reduction in loss adjustment expense reimbursements from the National Flood Insurance Program and one time favorable settlements with clients in 2005. 55 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $373,276 or 39%, to $1,332,236 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $958,960 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $349,463, or 41%. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners product lines, due to continued organic growth of these businesses combined with $123,818 of net earned premium resulting from the acquisition of SFIS. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fee income of $11,265, or 30%, primarily from growth in creditor placed homeowners loan tracking services. Also contributing to the increase in revenues was higher investment income of $12,548, or 20%, due to higher invested assets combined with higher investment yields. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $221,667 or 30%, to $962,173 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $740,506 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $91,214 and an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $130,453. The combined ratio decreased 610 basis points from 82.6% to 76.5% primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and proactive risk management. The increase in policyholder benefits is primarily attributable to the growth in our creditor placed homeowners business and approximately $8,000 in lower reimbursements from the National Flood Insurance Program for the adjudication of expenses related to the 2005 catastrophe flood losses (from approximately $18,500 in 2005 to $10,500 in 2006). This increase is partially offset by lower net catastrophe losses of approximately $42,000 and a favorable settlement with two former clients of $8,500. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by $69,939 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues combined with approximately $11,400 of one time income recognized in 2005 related to favorable settlements with two clients which resulted in a release of certain accrued commissions. General expenses increased by $60,514 due to increases in employment related expenses consistent with business growth and additional operating expenses associated with the SFIS business. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $68,286, or 91%, to $143,227 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $74,941 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment net income is primarily attributable to lower net catastrophe losses, improved loss experience absent catastrophe losses and higher net earned premiums in our creditor placed homeowners business. Net income was also positively impacted by approximately $11,100 (after tax) primarily related to the release of certain accrued commissions and claims payable associated with three clients, two of which previously declared bankruptcy. We favorably settled many of our claims with these clients during 2005. Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $80,628, or 9%, to $958,960 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $878,332 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $90,075 or 12%, primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums in our creditor placed homeowners business. This was partially offset by a reduction in net earned premiums of approximately $26,000, due to additional catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to the hurricanes. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $24,747 or 3%, to $740,506 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 from $765,253 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease is primarily 56 Table of Contents due to a decrease in policyholder benefits offset by an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses. The decrease in policyholder benefits of $46,419, or 13%, is primarily attributable to $44,400 in lower catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance in 2005 versus 2004. We incurred losses from catastrophes, net of reinsurance of $48,700 in 2005, compared to $93,100 in 2004. The decrease was a result of the different severity of gross losses from each storm and the change in composition of our reinsurance coverage in 2005. Additionally, we collected approximately $18,500 of loss adjustment expense reimbursements from the National Flood Insurance Program for providing processing and adjudication services, which resulted in reduced policyholder benefits. We continued to see improvement in our overall loss ratio in 2005, excluding catastrophe losses. In addition, benefits and losses reflect a one time reduction of claims payable of $5,700 associated with a client that previously declared bankruptcy. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $21,672, or 5%. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, decreased by $3,365 primarily due to a one time reduction of $11,400 of commission liabilities as a result of favorable settlements with two clients offset by higher expenses related to the growth of our creditor placed homeowners insurance products. General expenses increased by $25,037 due to growth in the business and expenses relating to the 2005 hurricane season, including guaranty fund assessments. 57 Table of Contents Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,083,957 $ 2,163,965 $ 2,231,298 Net investment income 75,215 69,056 67,902 Fees and other income 41,560 40,344 38,708 Total revenues 2,200,732 2,273,365 2,337,908 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (1,300,817 ) (1,344,624 ) (1,422,783 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (641,328 ) (657,899 ) (674,907 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,942,145 ) (2,002,523 ) (2,097,690 ) Segment income before income tax 258,587 270,842 240,218 Income taxes (90,668 ) (92,787 ) (81,931 ) Segment income after tax $ 167,919 $ 178,055 $ 158,287 Net earned premiums and other considerations: Individual Markets Individual Medical $ 1,213,677 $ 1,164,498 $ 1,100,868 Short term medical 101,454 110,912 114,583 Subtotal 1,315,131 1,275,410 1,215,451 Small employer group: 768,826 888,555 1,015,847 Total $ 2,083,957 $ 2,163,965 $ 2,231,298 Membership by product line: Individual Markets Individual medical 641 644 675 Short term medical 87 102 107 Subtotal 728 746 782 Small employer group: 207 255 333 Total 935 1,001 1,115 Ratios: Loss ratio (1) 62.4 % 62.1 % 63.8 % Expense ratio (2) 30.2 % 29.8 % 29.7 % Combined ratio (3) 91.4 % 90.8 % 92.4 % (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

The decrease in segment income was primarily attributable to an overall decline in membership due to continued increased competition and our strict adherence to underwriting guidelines. The decrease in net income was partially offset by an increase in investment income from real estate partnerships of approximately $4,900 (after tax). Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $72,633, or 3%, to $2,200,732 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,273,365 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased by $39,721, or 3%, primarily due to premium rate increases. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased by $119,729, or 13%, due to a decline in members, partially offset by premium rate increases. The small employer group business continues to experience decreases in new business due to increased competition and our strict adherence to underwriting guidelines. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in investment income of $6,159, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in real estate partnership investment income of approximately $7,500. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $60,378, or 3%, to $1,942,145 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,002,523 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Policyholder benefits decreased by $43,807, or 3%. The benefit loss ratio increased by 30 basis points, from 62.1% to 62.4%. The decrease in policyholder benefits was primarily due to the decline in net earned premiums, partially offset by higher claims experience primarily on individual medical business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $16,571, or 3%. The expense ratio increased by 40 basis points, from 29.8% to 30.2%. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to decreased commission expense resulting from the decline in small employer group business. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $19,768, or 12%, to $178,055 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $158,287 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an improved benefit loss ratio in the small employer group business. The increase is partially offset by two items. First, an overall decline in membership due to continued increased competition and strict adherence to our underwriting guidelines. Second, an increase in expenses of approximately $6,500 (after tax) due to increased spending on initiatives aimed at growing the individual markets business. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $64,543, or 3%, to $2,273,365 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,337,908 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased by $59,959, or 5%, primarily due to premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in members. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased by $127,292, or 13%, due to a decline in members, partially offset by premium rate increases. Both individual markets and the small employer group business continue to experience decreases in new business due to increased competition in their respective markets and strict adherence to our underwriting guidelines. 59 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $95,167, or 5%, to $2,002,523 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,097,690 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The benefit loss ratio decreased by 170 basis points, from 63.8% to 62.1%. The improvement in the benefit loss ratio is due to a decrease in policyholder benefits of $78,159, or 5%, primarily due to the overall decline in members and favorable claims experience in the small employer group business. The expense ratio increased by 10 basis points, from 29.7% to 29.8%. The increase in the expense ratio is primarily due to a proportionately smaller decrease in expenses compared to the decrease in net earned premiums and fees and other income. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by $17,008, or 3%, primarily due to a decline in first year business in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting in decreased commission expense and other acquisition costs in both individual markets and small employer group business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $10,000 in spending on initiatives aimed at growing the individual markets business. Assurant Employee Benefits Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee Benefits segment results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,179,902 $ 1,277,838 $ 1,276,812 Net investment income 158,525 156,889 149,718 Fees and other income 27,541 26,214 29,306 Total revenues 1,365,968 1,460,941 1,455,836 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (830,634 ) (936,835 ) (950,235 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (407,020 ) (418,542 ) (409,737 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (1,237,654 ) (1,355,377 ) (1,359,972 ) Segment income before income tax 128,314 105,564 95,864 Income taxes (44,711 ) (37,198 ) (33,654 ) Segment income after tax $ 83,603 $ 68,366 $ 62,210 Ratios: Loss ratio (1) 70.4 % 73.3 % 74.4 % Expense ratio (2) 33.7 % 32.1 % 31.4 % Net earned premiums and other considerations: By major product groupings: Group dental $ 428,218 $ 502,789 $ 520,513 Group disability single premiums for closed blocks (3) 46,313 26,700 40,906 All Other group disability 480,924 489,840 465,517 Group life 224,447 258,509 249,876 Total $ 1,179,902 $ 1,277,838 $ 1,276,812 (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

(3) This represents single premium on closed blocks of group disability business. 60 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased by $15,237, or 22%, to $83,603 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $68,366 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment income was primarily driven by continued favorable group disability experience and improved group dental experience. Disability recovery rates, which include claimants who return to work, and experience in our DRMS channel, were improved. The improvement in loss ratios is partially offset by the decrease in revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $94,973, or 7%, to $1,365,968 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $1,460,941 for the years ended December 31, 2005. Excluding group disability single premium for closed blocks, net earned premiums and other considerations decreased $117,549 or 9%, from the prior year primarily due to increased lapses and decreased sales. Lapse experience and sales trends reflect the transition to the business small case strategy along with disciplined pricing in a competitive marketplace. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $117,723, or 9%, to $1,237,654 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $1,355,377 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss ratio decreased 290 basis points, from 73.3% to 70.4%, primarily due to continued favorable group disability experience. Group disability recovery rates, which include claimants who return to work, and deaths were higher compared to the prior year. Experience in our DRMS channel also improved. Group dental experience has improved primarily due to disciplined pricing actions. The expense ratio increased 160 basis points from 32.1% to 33.7%. The increase in the expense ratio is primarily driven by the decrease in revenues that was proportionally larger than the decrease in general expenses. Selling, underwriting and general expenses have decreased $11,522, or 3%, year over year. In the prior year, we had a non recurring reduction in short term incentive compensation expenses. Excluding the prior year non recurring reduction, selling, general and underwriting expenses have decreased primarily due to expense management consistent with revenue trends. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net income increased by $6,156, or 10%, to $68,366 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $62,210 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in segment income was primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits. This decrease was driven by improved group life mortality and improved group dental experience, partially offset by lower group disability claim closures. Total Revenues Total revenues remained relatively flat increasing $5,105 to $1,460,941 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,455,836 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premiums and other considerations remained flat compared to prior year due to our increased focus on small case and voluntary business. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in net investment income of $7,171, or 5%. During the third quarter, we recognized $2,560 of investment income from a real estate partnership. The remaining increase in net investment income is primarily due to an increase in average invested assets of approximately 3%. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $4,595, or less than 1%, to $1,355,377 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $1,359,972 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss ratio decreased 110 basis 61 Table of Contents points, from 74.4% to 73.3%. The decrease in the loss ratio and the decrease in policyholder benefits of $13,400, or 1%, was primarily due to improved group life mortality and improved group dental experience partially offset by lower group disability claim closures. The expense ratio increased 70 basis points, from 31.4% to 32.1%. The increase in the expense ratio is due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $8,805, or 2%, primarily driven by higher technology related costs due to implementation of technology aimed at improving our customer service. Corporate and Other The table below presents information regarding the Corporate and Other segments results of operations: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenues: Net investment income $ 35,935 $ 27,794 $ 25,878 Net realized gains on investments 111,865 8,235 24,308 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 37,300 42,508 57,632 Loss on disposal of business (9,232 ) Fees and other income 682 1,432 1,844 Total revenues 185,782 79,969 100,430 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits (5 ) (61,943 ) (7,941 ) Selling, underwriting and general expenses (83,076 ) (96,055 ) (76,903 ) Interest expense (61,243 ) (61,258 ) (58,581 ) Total benefits, losses and expenses (144,324 ) (219,256 ) (143,425 ) Segment income (loss) before income tax 41,458 (139,287 ) (42,995 ) Income taxes (17,123 ) 95,847 7,399 Segment income (loss) after tax $ 24,335 $ (43,440 ) $ (35,596 ) As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $249,911 (pre tax) of deferred gains that had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the liabilities in the blocks decrease. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income improved by $67,775, or over 100%, to $24,335 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from a net loss of ($43,440) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This improvement is mainly due to a realized gain of $63,900 (after tax) from the sale of our investment in PHCS, a realized gain from the reduction of our mortgage loan loss reserve, strengthening of reserve accruals on certain excess of loss programs in 2005 that did not recur in 2006 and a reduction in stock appreciation rights expense upon adopting FAS 123R. This improvement was partially offset by the 2005 release of $39,400 of previously provided tax accruals which were no longer considered necessary due to the resolution of IRS audits and $5,500 of tax benefit related to the technical correction of tax legislation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) that did not recur in 2006. 62 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues increased by $105,813, or over 100%, to $185,782 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $79,969 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Revenues increased mainly due to a $103,630 increase in realized gains on investments primarily due to the sale of our investment in PHCS, resulting in a pre tax gain of $98,300 and a reduction of our mortgage loan loss reserve of $15,168 due to a refinement of managements best estimate of this reserve. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by $74,932, or 34%, to $144,324 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $219,256 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This decrease is primarily due to $61,943 of costs incurred in 2005 on excess of loss reinsurance programs, related to personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks, reinsured and ceded by certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. In addition, stock appreciation rights expense declined, due to the adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. These expense declines were partially offset by a $5,000 contribution to the Assurant Charitable Foundation. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Segment net loss increased by $7,844, or 22%, to $(43,440) for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $(35,596) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits due to the strengthening of reserve accruals on certain excess of loss reinsurance programs sold by our subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997, an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses due to stock compensation and a reduction in the amortization of deferred gains on disposal of business. The increase in net loss was partially offset by approximately $39,400 of income tax accrual releases due to the resolution of IRS audits. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased by $20,461, or 20%, to $79,969 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $100,430 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower net realized gains on investments and lower amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses due to continued runoff of the sold businesses. In addition, as a result of our annual review of estimates affecting the deferred gain on disposal of businesses we took a charge of approximately $4,600. Total Benefits, Losses, and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by $75,831, or 53%, to $219,256 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $143,425 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $54,002 as a result of costs incurred on excess of loss reinsurance programs, related to personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks, reinsured and ceded by certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. These charges include a settlement with one of our largest reinsurers for 1997 and strengthening of reserves for remaining portions of the program. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by $19,152, or 25%, primarily due to stock appreciation rights (SARs), which increased by $18,000 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of appreciation in the stock price. Income Taxes The income tax benefits increased by $88,448 to $95,847 for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $7,399 for the year end December 31, 2004. Approximately $39,400 of the increased benefit was primarily due to the release of previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the resolution of IRS audits. In addition, approximately $5,500 of the increased benefit was due to a recaptured tax 63 Table of Contents benefit from the $19,000 of tax expense we incurred in 2004 on the repatriation of capital from Puerto Rico, primarily due to a technical correction of the Jobs Act. Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2006 As of December 31, 2005 (in thousands) Fixed maturities $ 9,118,049 73 % $ 8,961,778 72 % Equity securities 741,639 6 % 693,101 5 % Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1,266,158 10 % 1,212,006 10 % Policy loans 58,733 1 % 61,043 1 % Short term investments 314,114 3 % 427,474 3 % Collateral held under securities lending 365,958 3 % 610,662 5 % Other investments 564,494 4 % 549,759 4 % Total investments $ 12,429,145 100 % $ 12,515,823 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 67% and 66% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. As interest rates increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities decreases. The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (losses), pre tax, on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, 2006 As of December 31, 2005 Fixed maturities: Amortized cost $ 8,934,017 $ 8,668,595 Net unrealized gains 184,032 293,183 Fair value $ 9,118,049 $ 8,961,778 Equities: Cost $ 735,566 $ 694,977 Net unrealized gains (losses) 6,073 (1,876 ) Fair value $ 741,639 $ 693,101 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased by $109,151 from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The decrease in net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to an increase in treasury yield. The yield on 5 year treasury securities increased by approximately 39 basis points and the yield on 10 year treasury securities increased by 34 basis points between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Net unrealized gains on equity securities increased by $7,949 from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to changes in the preferred stock market. The price return of Merrill Lynch Global Bond Index Preferred Stock, Hybrid index ended 2006 up slightly after decreasing for most of the year. Net investment income increased by $49,429, or 7%, to $736,686 at December 31, 2006 from $687,257 at December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in yields and average invested assets. Net investment income includes $18,578 of investment income from real estate partnerships in 2006 compared to 64 Table of Contents $12,565 in 2005. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, was 5.67% in 2006 compared to 5.54% in 2005. Net investment income increased by $52,508, or 8%, to $687,257 at December 31, 2005 from $634,749 at December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily the result of real estate partnership income and increased average invested assets. Net investment income includes $12,565 of investment income from real estate partnerships in 2005 compared to zero in 2004. The yield on average invested assets and cash equivalents, which excludes real estate investment income, remained relatively flat at 5.54% in 2005 compared to 5.55% in 2004. We recorded $810, $765, and $600 of realized losses in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, associated with other than temporary declines in value of available for sale securities. We also recorded $854, zero, and $4,217 of pre tax realized losses in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, associated with other investments.

Approximately 79% and 77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 1,394 and 1,172 individual securities with 94% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $200 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than six months but less than 12 months were approximately $2,171 and $9,388 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no securities with an unrealized loss of greater than $200 having a market value below 88% and 79% of book value at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and recorded $810, $765, and $600 of additional other than temporary impairments as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Due to issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2006 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these assets until the date of recovery. 66 Table of Contents Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions To exit certain businesses, we have used reinsurance to facilitate transactions because the businesses share legal entities with business segments we retain. Assets supporting liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts and the separate accounts relating to divested business are still reflected in our balance sheet. Segments Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property segments write business produced by clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full statutory financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory 67 Table of Contents restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2007, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval for our statutory subsidiaries, is approximately $476,070. Liquidity Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $554,270, $530,094 and $361,700 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, and to repurchase our outstanding shares. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. We conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance with formal Company wide Asset Liability Management (ALM) guidelines. To complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a large, varied set of plausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. Alternative asset portfolio structures are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk preference. Sensitivity testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed. Given our ALM asset allocation processes and the nature of the products we offer, we have minimal exposure to disintermediation risk. Our liabilities have limited policyholder optionality which results in policyholder behavior that is mainly insensitive to the interest rate environment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid fixed income securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. Generally, our subsidiaries premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. However, there are instances where unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds including selling assets from the subsidiaries investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper and drawing funds from our revolving credit facility. We consider the permanence of the cash need as well as the cost of each source of funds in determining which option to utilize. On February 15, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common shares payable on March 12, 2007 to stockholders of record as of February 26, 2007. We paid dividends of $0.08 per share of common stock on March 7, 2006 and $.10 per share of common stock on June 13, 2006, September 12, 2006 and December 11, 2006. We paid dividends of $0.07 per share of common stock on March 14, 2005 and $0.08 per share of common stock on June 7, 2005, September 7, 2005 and December 12, 2005. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be 68 Table of Contents dependent upon: our subsidiaries payment of dividends and or other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. Our pension plans were under funded by $113,026 at December 31, 2006. We established a funding policy in which service cost plus 15% of plan deficit will be contributed annually. We made $19,500 of pension plan contributions in 2006. See Note 21 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the components of the net periodic benefit cost. Commercial Paper Program The Company maintains a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our commercial paper program is rated AMB 2 by A.M. Best, P 2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. In April 2005, we amended and restated our $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase Bank. The amended and restated credit facility is unsecured and is available until April 2010, so long as the Company is in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at December 31, 2006. We did not use the revolving credit facility during 2006 and no amounts are outstanding. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. We are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. Senior Notes On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. Our senior notes are rated bbb by A.M. Best, Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by S&P. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The senior notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. 69 Table of Contents Management believes that our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities(1) $ 934,158 $ 899,176 $ 821,850 Investing activities (84,511 ) (548,688 ) (744,962 ) Financing activities (717,544 ) (302,001 ) (228,003 ) Net change in cash $ 132,103 $ 48,487 $ (151,115 ) (1) Includes effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $934,158 and $899,176 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $34,982 increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily due to cash provided by reinsurance recoverables relating to settlements for 2005 hurricane losses offset by a decrease in accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities was $899,176 and $821,850 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $77,326 increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily attributable to increased reserves and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by increased reinsurance recoverables. Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $84,511 and $548,688 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $464,177 decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily attributable to significant net cash received from the sale of short term investments in 2006 compared to cash used to purchase short term investments for the comparable period in 2005. Also, the net cash received from the SFIS acquisition, a decrease in cash outflows for investments in commercial mortgage loans on real estate and the cash received from the sale of PHCS, partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase fixed maturities, contributed to the overall decrease in cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $548,688 and $744,962 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $196,274 decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2005 over the comparable period in 2004 is primarily attributable to the decrease in net cash used to purchase fixed maturities and equity securities. This was partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase short term investments in 2005 compared to 2004. 70 Table of Contents Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $717,544 and $302,001 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $415,543 increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in net cash used to purchase treasury stock and a change in collateral held under securities lending. Net cash used in financing activities was $302,001 and $228,003 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $73,998 increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2005 over the comparable period in 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used to purchase treasury stock, the issuance of common stock and a change in collateral held under securities lending. Offsetting these changes was the net repayment of debt in 2004. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Security Mandatory redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust $ $ $ 66,734 Mandatory redeemable preferred stock dividends and interest paid 61,159 61,179 37,709 Common stock dividends 48,157 42,050 29,676 Total $ 109,316 $ 103,229 $ 134,119 Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations.

Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. 71 Table of Contents Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of $6,766,343 and claims and benefits payable of $3,412,166 have been included in the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $33,219 and $28,216 of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in 72 Table of Contents prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity relating to price risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the yield curves. We have assumed that the United States and Canadian yield curve shifts are of equal direction and magnitude. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as callable bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage backed and asset backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2006 100 50 0 50 100 (in thousands) Total market value $ 9,733,684 $ 9,420,078 $ 9,118,049 $ 8,828,083 $ 8,549,122 % Change in market value from base case 6.75 % 3.31 % % 3.18 % 5.77 % $ Change in market value from base case $ 615,635 $ 302,029 $ $ (289,966 ) $ (568,927 ) The interest rate sensitivity relating to reinvestment risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume purchases in the primary market and considers the effects of interest rates on sales. The effects of embedded options including call or put features are not considered. Our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis on our reported portfolio yield: Interest Rate Movement Analysis Of Portfolio Yield of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2006 100 50 0 50 100 Portfolio Yield 5.69 % 5.75 % 5.82 % 5.89 % 5.95 % Basis Point Change in Portfolio Yield (0.13 )% (0.07 )% % 0.07 % 0.13 % Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. 73 Table of Contents Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings to determine an issuers rating. The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2006: Rating Fair Value Percentage of Total (in thousands) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,127,830 67 % Baa 2,386,317 26 % Ba 479,037 6 % B and lower 124,865 1 % Total $ 9,118,049 100 % We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments as described above under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $3,914,972 of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2006, we are protected from the credit risk by using various types of risk mitigation mechanisms such as trusts, letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,366,601 and $1,361,615 as of December 31, 2006 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. We believe that a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated A or better by A.M. Best. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 12% of Assurant preneeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $398,000 as of December 31, 2006 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing contracts with payments tied to the CPI. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. 74 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily the British pound and Danish krone. However, total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 2% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2006. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets denominated in Canadian dollars on our entire fixed maturity portfolio is summarize in the following table: Foreign Exchange Movement Analysis Of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Assets As of December 31, 2006 Foreign exchange spot rate at December 31, 2006, US Dollar to Canadian Dollar 10% 5% 0 5% 10% Total market value $ 9,046,178 $ 9,082,113 $ 9,118,049 $ 9,153,984 $ 9,189,920 % change of market value from base case (0.79 )% (0.39 )% % 0.39 % 0.79 % $ change of market value from base case $ (71,871 ) $ (35,936 ) $ $ 35,935 $ 71,871 The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our consolidated net income is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume earnings in Canadian dollars are recognized evenly throughout a period.

Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. We have purchased contracts to cap the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our preneed insurance policies. 75 Table of Contents In 2003, we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (i.e., total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 76 Table of Contents
