Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Forward Looking Statements for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. General On April 1, 2006, the Company separated its Assurant Solutions segment into two segments: Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property. In addition, concurrent with the creation of the new Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property segments, the Company realigned the Preneed segment under the new Assurant Solutions segment. Segment income statement for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure. We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned from short term investments held, interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments, run off Asbestos business, and additional costs associated with excess of loss reinsurance and ceded to certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through reinsurance agreements as described below. Critical Factors Affecting Results Our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. Therefore, factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 43 Table of Contents Revenues We generate our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. In late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions domestic credit insurance clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products, from which we earned premium revenue, to debt protection administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt protection administration programs include services for non insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur. Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of investments. Currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short term investments. The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. We also have investments that carry pre payment risk, such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities. Actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from estimates at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. Therefore, we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments. Expenses Our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting and general expenses and interest expense. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting policyholder benefits, claims and other costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future policyholder benefits and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management catastrophe reinsurance coverage and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. We incur expenses related to our debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. 44 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors such as those described above or in Item 1A. Risk Factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates. The actual amounts realized could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves Reserves are established according to GAAP using generally accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liabilities and damage awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made. 45 Table of Contents The following table provides reserve information by our major lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 FuturePolicyBenefits andExpenses UnearnedPremiums CaseReserves IncurredBut NotReportedReserves FuturePolicyBenefits andExpenses UnearnedPremiums CaseReserves IncurredBut NotReportedReserves Long Duration Contracts: Pre funded funeral life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts $ 3,479,115 $ 3,877 $ 11,559 $ 3,991 $ 3,031,487 $ 3,339 $ 10,599 $ 3,094 Life insurance no longer offered 511,093 765 1,414 509 502,406 784 1,356 467 Universal life and other products no longer offered 307,930 1,689 267 8,211 331,257 1,537 263 8,289 FFG, LTC and other disposed businesses 2,756,059 44,414 270,085 35,406 2,731,285 45,129 262,960 34,743 Medical 130,005 18,564 14,712 30,998 152,954 23,827 34,454 43,602 All other 5,294 316 14,174 6,248 5,085 504 11,532 7,213 Short Duration Contracts: Group term life 6,659 231,534 49,509 6,787 243,753 53,221 Group disability 2,806 1,363,098 161,733 2,195 1,362,594 156,296 Medical 109,755 115,198 201,601 95,651 123,736 192,394 Dental 5,035 3,479 17,419 3,796 4,746 19,873 Property and Warranty 1,816,436 192,307 312,091 1,488,253 195,306 296,336 Credit Life and Disability 494,118 102,151 87,373 494,113 125,909 93,261 Extended Service Contract 2,768,048 4,606 40,736 2,179,345 3,075 32,462 All other 138,227 9,678 12,997 84,633 3,251 3,954 Total $ 7,189,496 $ 5,410,709 $ 2,334,262 $ 968,822 $ 6,754,474 $ 4,429,893 $ 2,383,534 $ 945,205 For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. The following discusses the reserving process for our major long duration product line. Long Duration Contracts Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on our experience and include a provision for possible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in future years income in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Risks related to the reserves recorded for contracts from FFG and LTC disposed businesses have been 100% ceded via reinsurance. While the Company has not been released from the contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic and mortality assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect us unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer. Premium deficiency testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve. 46 Table of Contents Historically, premium deficiency testing has not resulted in a material adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated. Short Duration Contracts For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are reported when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are further discussions on the reserving process for our major short duration products. Group Disability and Group Term Life Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on group long term disability policies and for disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim recovery rates, claim management practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment. Key sensitivities at December 31, 2007 for group long term disability claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination rates. Claims andBenefits Payable Claims andBenefits Payable Group disability, discount rate decreased by 10% $ 1,602,813 Group disability, claim terminationrate 10% lower $ 1,569,283 Group disability, as reported $ 1,524,831 Group disability, as reported $ 1,524,831 Group disability, discount rate increased by 10% $ 1,454,695 Group disability, claim terminationrate 10% higher $ 1,484,353 The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life waiver of premium reserves. Claims and Benefits Payable Group term life, discount rate decreased by 10% $ 291,975 Group term life, as reported $ 281,043 Group life, discount rate increased by 10% $ 271,156 Medical IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of business, and the primary methods we use in their estimation are the loss development method and the projected claim method for recent claim periods. Under the loss development method, we estimate ultimate losses for each incident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. Under the projected claim method, we use ultimate loss ratios when development methods do not provide enough data to reliably estimate reserves. In addition, we use variations on each method as well as a blend of the two. The primary variation is the use of projected claims using differing experience periods. We primarily use these two methods in our Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying exclusively on a single method. 47 Table of Contents We develop the best estimate of expected outstanding liabilities for medical IBNR reserves using generally accepted actuarial principles. The various product lines are evaluated using experience data of sufficient detail to allow for the compilation of historical loss patterns including but not limited to claim lag factors, projected claims per member and restated development factors. If sufficient experience data is not available, experience data from other similar blocks may be used. Industry data as well as data from consulting actuaries provide additional benchmarks when historical experience is too limited. This information is used to provide a range in which the expected outstanding liabilities may fall. The selection of the ultimate loss estimate varies by product line as the credibility of certain methods differs depending upon the in force volume, the products claim volatility and the method itself. The selection is also influenced by other available information that may indicate that historical experience data may not be appropriate to use for current liability estimates. Examples of such information include but are not limited to changes in claims inventory levels, changes in provider negotiated rates or cost savings initiatives, increasing or decreasing medical cost trends, product changes and demographic changes in the underlying insured population. The development of prior period estimates is also reviewed to assist in establishing the current periods loss reserves. The short claim lag time inherent in many of our Medical products allows for emerging trends to be identified quickly. We evaluate all pertinent information and indicated ranges using experience and actuarial judgment to establish our best estimate for the associated liabilities. Key sensitivities as of December 31, 2007 for medical reserves include claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and product mix. Claims and Benefits Payable Medical, loss development factors 1% lower $ 341,799 * Medical, as reported $ 316,799 Medical, loss development factors 1% higher $ 295,799 * This refers to loss development factors for the most recent four months. Our historical claims experience indicates that approximately 84% of medical claims are paid within four months of the incurred date. None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our Medical line of business were attributable to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions. Property and Warranty We develop the best estimate of loss reserves for our Property and Warranty line of business on a product line basis using generally accepted actuarial principles. Our Property and Warranty line of business includes creditor placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and some longer tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves consist of case, IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property and Warranty reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the current case incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business specific matters such as current claims payment practices. The loss development method involves aggregating loss data (paid losses and case incurred losses) by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age in quarters (or years) for each product or product grouping. As the data ages, we compile loss development factors that measure emerging claim development patterns 48 Table of Contents between reporting periods. By selecting the most appropriate loss development factors, we project the known losses to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The data is analyzed at a minimum using four different loss development methods by product or product grouping: a) annual paid losses, b) annual case incurred losses, c) quarterly paid losses and d) quarterly case incurred losses. Also, in addition to the above, some product groupings are analyzed using the expected loss ratio and Bornhuetter Ferguson loss development methods. Each of these reserve methodologies produces an indication of the loss reserves for the product or product grouping. The process to select the best estimate differs across lines of business. The single best estimate is determined based on many factors, including but not limited to: the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions, the quality and applicability of historical data whether it be internal or industry data, current and future market conditions the economic environment will often impact the development of loss triangles, the extent of data segmentation data should be homogenous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply, and the past variability of loss estimates the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others. We review operational and claims activity to gather additional pertinent information. After reviewing all additional pertinent information, a final IBNR amount for each product grouping is selected. We may use other methods depending on data credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by the various methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best estimate of Property and Warranty reserves is generally selected from the middle to upper end of the third quartile of the range of reasonable estimates. Most of our credit insurance business is written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits management to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any adjustment to prior years incurred claims in this line of business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions which is included in the selling, underwriting and general expenses line in our results of operations. While management has used its best judgment in establishing its estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. If the actual level of loss frequency and severity is higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves will be different than managements estimate. The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity levels on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2007 would be as follows: Change in both loss frequency and severity for all Property and Warranty Ultimate cost of claimsoccurring in 2007 Change in cost of claimsoccurring in 2007 3% higher $ 535,117 $ 30,718 2% higher $ 524,777 $ 20,378 1% higher $ 514,537 $ 10,138 Base scenario $ 504,398 $ 1% lower $ 494,261 $ (10,138 ) 2% lower $ 484,021 $ (20,378 ) 3% lower $ 473,681 $ (30,718 ) 49 Table of Contents Reserving for Asbestos and Other Claims We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from our participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and IBNR reserves of $39,400 (before reinsurance) and $32,000 (net of reinsurance) at December 31, 2007. We believe the balance of case and IBNR reserves for these liabilities are adequate. However, any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However, based on information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the consolidated financial statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. One of our subsidiaries, American Reliable Insurance Company (ARIC), participated in certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to retrocessionaires. ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and non disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated claims spirals devised to disproportionately pass claims losses to higher level reinsurance layers. Many of the companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and or litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaries, reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of the disputes involving ARIC and an affiliate, Bankers Insurance Company Limited (BICL), relating to the 1995 and 1997 program years, have been resolved by settlement or arbitration. As a result of the settlements and an arbitration (in which ARIC did not prevail) additional information became available in 2005, and, based on managements best estimate, we increased our reserves and recorded a total pre tax charge of $61,943 for the year ended December 31, 2005. On February 28, 2006, many of the disputes relating to losses in the 1996 program were settled. In 2007, there were two settlements relating to parts of the 1997 program. Loss accruals previously established relating to the 1996 program were adequate. Negotiations, arbitrations and litigation are still ongoing or will be scheduled for the remaining disputes. We believe, based on information currently available, that the amounts accrued for all outstanding disputes are adequate. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty. DAC The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses. Premium deficiency testing is performed annually and reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions, including the anticipation of interest income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium 50 Table of Contents deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency. Long Duration Contracts Acquisition costs for preneed life insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the premium paying period. These acquisition costs consist primarily of first year commissions paid to agents and sales and policy issue costs. For preneed investment type annuities, universal life insurance policies and investment type annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities. Acquisition costs relating to worksite group disability which typically has high front end costs and are expected to remain in force for an extended period of time consist primarily of first year commissions to brokers and one time policy transfer fees and costs of issuing new certificates. These acquisition costs are front end loaded, thus they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to a majority of individual medical contracts issued prior to 2003, a limited number of individual medical contracts issued from 2003 through 2006 in certain jurisdictions, and individual voluntary limited benefit health policies issued in 2007 and later, are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each individual medical contract. Short Duration Contracts Acquisition costs relating to property contracts, warranty and extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and balances of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability and group dental consist primarily of compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs are front end loaded; thus, they are deferred and amortized over the estimated terms of the underlying contracts. Acquisition costs on the majority of individual medical contracts issued from 2003 through 2006, all individual medical contracts issued after 2006 and all small group medical contracts consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation to representatives. These contracts are considered short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these costs are not deferred, but rather are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred. Investments We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment. Securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their original purchase price are added to the impairment watchlist, which is discussed at quarterly meetings attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance departments. Any security whose price decrease is deemed other than temporary is 51 Table of Contents written down to its then current market level with the amount of the writedown reported as a realized loss in that period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could result in additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary. See also Investments in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report and Item 1A Risk Factors Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability and Investments contained later in this item. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized on the specific identification basis. Reinsurance Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of the dates indicated: As ofDecember 31, 2007 As ofDecember 31, 2006 (in thousands) Reinsurance recoverables $ 3,904,348 $ 3,914,972 We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted to $2,779,030 and $2,728,216 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 (in thousands) Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 2,662,654 $ 2,635,445 Ceded unearned premium 643,792 637,447 Ceded claims and benefits payable 540,615 577,052 Ceded paid losses 57,287 65,028 Total $ 3,904,348 $ 3,914,972 We utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant Solutions, client risk and profit sharing. See also Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Credit Risk. 52 Table of Contents Retirement and Other Employee Benefits We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. Contingencies We follow the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). This requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is reported if reasonably estimable and probable. We establish reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or, if no one estimated number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, we report an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimated range. Contingencies affecting the Company include litigation matters which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Statement of Position No. 05 1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts (SOP 05 1). SOP 05 1 provides guidance on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts. An internal replacement is a modification in product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. Modifications that result in a new contract that is substantially different from the replaced contract are accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract, and the associated unamortized DAC, unearned revenue liabilities and deferred sales inducements from the replaced contract must be reported as an expense immediately. Modifications resulting in a new contract that is substantially the same as the replaced contract are accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Prior to the adoption of the SOP 05 1, certain internal replacements that did meet new criteria were accounted for as continuations of the replaced contract. Therefore, the accounting policy for certain internal replacements has changed as a result of the adoption of SOP 05 1. At adoption, the Company recognized a $6,560 decrease to deferred acquisition costs and a corresponding decrease of $4,264 (after tax) to retained earnings. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (FAS 155). FAS 155 resolves issues addressed in FAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets. FAS 155 (a) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; (b) clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of FAS 133; (c) establishes a requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (d) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and (e) eliminates restrictions on a qualifying special purpose entitys ability to hold passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument. FAS 155 also requires presentation within the consolidated financial statements that identifies those hybrid financial instruments for which the fair value election has been applied and information on the statement of operations impact of the 53 Table of Contents changes in fair value of those instruments. The adoption of FAS 155 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized a $1,508 increase to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and a corresponding reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. See Note 8 for further information regarding the adoption of FIN 48. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to adopt FAS 157 on January 1, 2008. FAS 157 will be applied prospectively as of January 1, 2008 except for certain financial instruments that were measured at fair value using a transaction price. For these financial instruments, FAS 157 requires limited retrospective adoption and thus the difference between carrying amounts and the fair values of the relevant financial instruments will be shown as a cumulative effect adjustment to January 1, 2008 retained earnings. The adoption of FAS 157, including the limited retrospective adoption, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). FAS 159 provides a choice to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on specified election dates and requires disclosures about the election of the fair value option. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is required to adopt FAS 159 on January 1, 2008. The Company has chosen not to elect the fair value option for any financial or non financial instruments as of the adoption date, thus the adoption of FAS 159 will not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In March 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in Issue No. 06 10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06 10). EITF 06 10 provides guidance regarding the employers recognition of the liability and the related compensation costs for collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements that provide a benefit to an employee that extends into postretirement periods. This consensus concludes that for a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement, an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with FASB Statement No. 106, Employers Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, (if, in substance, a postretirement benefit plan exists) or Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 12, Deferred Compensation Contracts, (APB 12) (if the arrangement is, in substance, an individual deferred compensation contract) based on the substantive agreement with the employee. EITF 06 10 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and therefore the Company is required to adopt EIFT 06 10 on January 1, 2008. The Company has been recording the liability for future benefits in accordance with APB 12 and thus the adoption of EITF 06 10 will not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (FAS 141R). FAS 141R replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations (FAS 141). FAS 141R retains the fundamental requirements in FAS 141 that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations, that an acquirer be identified for each business combination and for goodwill to be recognized and measured as a residual. FAS 141R expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. FAS 141R broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests 54 Table of Contents transferred as a result of business combinations. FAS 141R also increases the disclosure requirements for business combinations in the financial statements. FAS 141R is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt FAS 141R on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 141R and the potential impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Non controlling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 requires that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary be separately reported within equity and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the non controlling interest be presented in the statement of operations. FAS 160 also calls for consistency in reporting changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary and necessitates fair value measurement of any non controlling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt FAS 160 on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 160 and the potential impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In February 2008, the FASB issued Financial Statement of Position FAS 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2). FSP FAS 157 2 defers the effective date of FAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities measured on a non recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the FAS 157 requirements for its non financial assets and non financial liabilities measured on a non recurring basis on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 157 for its non financial assets and non financial liabilities measured on a non recurring basis and the potential impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Results of Operations Assurant Consolidated Overview The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 7,407,730 $ 6,843,775 $ 6,520,796 Net investment income 799,073 736,686 687,257 Net realized (losses) gains on investments (62,220 ) 111,865 8,235 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 33,139 37,300 42,508 Fees and other income 275,793 340,958 238,879 Total revenues 8,453,515 8,070,584 7,497,675 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 3,712,711 3,535,521 3,705,904 Selling, underwriting and general expenses (1) 3,668,586 3,378,078 3,074,905 Interest expense 61,178 61,243 61,258 Total benefits, losses and expenses 7,442,475 6,974,842 6,842,067 Income before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,011,040 1,095,742 655,608 Provision for income taxes 357,294 379,871 176,253 Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 653,746 715,871 479,355 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 1,547 Net income $ 653,746 $ 717,418 $ 479,355 (1) Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general and administrative expenses. 55 Table of Contents The following discussion provides a high level analysis of how the consolidated results were affected by our four operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment. Please see the discussion that follows, for each of these segments, for a more detailed analysis of the fluctuations. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net income decreased $63,672, or 9%, to $653,746 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $717,418 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to our Corporate and Other segment, which had $62,220 of net realized losses on investments in 2007, compared with $111,865 of net realized gains on investments in 2006. The net realized losses in 2007 include $31,320 (after tax) of realized losses from the write down of other than temporary declines in our investment portfolio, while the net realized gains in 2006 includes a $63,900 (after tax) gain from the sale of our investment in PHCS. Also in 2006 our Assurant Solutions segment had a favorable legal settlement of $40,500 (after tax) and one time fee income recognized from a closed block of extended service contract business. Offsetting these items was the continued strong performance of our Assurant Specialty Property segment, which continued to experience strong premium growth and excellent combined ratios in its creditor placed homeowners insurance business, mainly due to exceptionally mild weather and our ability to leverage the benefits of scale. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net income increased $238,063, or 50%, to $717,418 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $479,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Assurant Specialty Propertys creditor placed homeowners business net earned premiums, fee income, improved loss experience and the lack of significant catastrophes in 2006. Assurant Solutions also contributed to the increase in net income primarily due to higher fee income from a $40,500 (after tax) legal settlement, growth in the extended service contract business and one time fee income recognized from a closed block of extended service contract business. Corporate and Other also contributed to the increase in net income primarily due to higher net realized due on investments gains to $63,900 (after tax) from the sale of our investment in PHCS. The $1,547 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is a result of adopting FAS 123R and reflects the difference between compensation expense that would have been recognized using actual forfeitures and compensation expense that would have been recognized using expected forfeitures. 56 Table of Contents Assurant Solutions Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions segment results of operations: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,530,445 $ 2,371,605 $ 2,220,145 Net investment income 427,331 392,510 371,565 Fees and other income 159,211 221,751 132,730 Total revenues 3,116,987 2,985,866 2,724,440 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 1,073,858 998,770 1,046,900 Selling, underwriting and general expenses 1,830,709 1,689,776 1,477,505 Total benefits, losses and expenses 2,904,567 2,688,546 2,524,405 Segment income before provision for income taxes 212,420 297,320 200,035 Provision for income taxes 68,499 98,427 66,888 Segment net income $ 143,921 $ 198,893 $ 133,147 Net earned premiums and other considerations: Domestic: Credit $ 303,231 $ 368,712 $ 351,339 Service contracts 1,156,991 1,040,770 835,825 Other (1) 62,709 81,283 154,493 Total Domestic 1,522,931 1,490,765 1,341,657 International: Credit 376,709 394,482 339,227 Service contracts 249,803 99,494 41,006 Other (1) 39,144 66,729 32,276 Total International 665,656 560,705 412,509 Preneed 341,858 320,135 465,979 Total $ 2,530,445 $ 2,371,605 $ 2,220,145 Fees and other income: Domestic: Debt protection $ 31,093 $ 54,053 $ 51,420 Service contracts 70,709 66,427 46,523 Other (1) 25,039 80,072 18,993 Total Domestic 126,841 200,552 116,936 International 22,168 16,943 12,302 Preneed 10,202 4,256 3,492 Total $ 159,211 $ 221,751 $ 132,730 Gross written premiums (2): Domestic: Credit $ 656,975 $ 714,791 $ 767,466 Service contracts 1,828,048 1,600,588 1,414,529 Other (1) 85,005 108,569 192,856 Total Domestic 2,570,028 2,423,948 2,374,851 International: Credit 833,894 680,097 647,467 Service contracts 422,669 341,886 247,506 Other (1) 46,590 44,655 105,962 Total International 1,303,153 1,066,638 1,000,935 Total $ 3,873,181 $ 3,490,586 $ 3,375,786 Preneed (face sales) $ 395,790 $ 433,510 $ 542,515 Combined ratio (3): Domestic 101.1 % 99.4 % 99.9 % International 105.1 % 99.2 % 99.7 % 57 Table of Contents (1) This includes emerging products and run off products lines. (2) Gross written premiums does not necessarily translate to an equal amount of subsequent net earned premiums since Assurant Solutions reinsures a portion of its premiums to insurance subsidiaries of its clients. (3) The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income excluding the preneed business. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Income Segment net income decreased $54,972, or 28%, to $143,921 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $198,893 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a legal settlement of $40,500 (after tax) and fee income of $5,041 (after tax), from a closed block of extended service contract business, both recognized in the prior year. Absent these items, net income declined $9,431 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of continued investments made to support the segments strategic international expansion as well as a client related settlement expense of $3,431 (after tax). The results also include $6,560 (after tax) of unfavorable loss experience due to a claims backlog reported by a client and a resulting DAC write off in a credit life product in Brazil, which has since been re priced for some clients and discontinued for other clients. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $8,817 (after tax) in net investment income from real estate partnerships, the receipt of $3,510 (after tax) of contract settlement fees related to the sale of marketing rights for the independent U.S. preneed business, and $9,144 (after tax) of income stemming from our completed clients commission reconciliation project. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $131,121, or 4%, to $3,116,987 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $2,985,866 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This increase is due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $158,840, primarily attributable to growth in our domestic and international extended service contract business as well as growth in our preneed business, mainly due to the acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company (Mayflower) during 2007. These increases are partially offset by the decrease in net earned premiums from the continued runoff of our domestic credit insurance business. The increase in revenues was also due to an increase in net investment income of $34,821, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships of $13,000 and higher average invested assets. Fees and other income decreased $62,541, or 28%, primarily attributable to one time amounts totaling $70,056 due to a legal settlement and income from a closed block of extended service contract business, both recognized in the prior year. Absent these transactions, Assurant Solutions fee income increased $7,515, or 5%, primarily driven by continued growth of our extended service contract business due to acquisitions and $5,400 from the sale of the marketing rights of the Independent U.S. preneed business. These increases were partially offset by the loss of a debt deferment client. We experienced gross written premium growth in most of our product lines, with the exception of our domestic credit insurance and preneed businesses. Gross written premiums from our international credit business increased $153,797 primarily as a result of growth in Canada from existing clients. This growth is primarily due to increased marketing efforts and strong performance from clients which lead to greater outstanding credit card balances. Gross written premiums in our international service contract business increased $80,783, mainly due to increased premiums from existing clients, and greater international penetration, which is consistent with our strategic international expansion plan. Gross written premiums in our domestic service contract business increased $227,460 due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums from our domestic credit insurance business decreased $57,816 due to the continued runoff of this product line and the loss of a client. We experienced a decrease of $37,720 in our preneed business due to the sale of the U.S. Independent distribution channel, however, this was partially offset by growth in the business from the Mayflower acquisition. 58 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $216,021, or 8%, to $2,904,567 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $2,688,546 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $140,933. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased $123,846 primarily due to the overall commission rate increases caused by the change in the mix of business as evidenced by our growing service contract business, which has higher commission rates compared to the lower commission rates on the decreasing domestic credit business. Additionally, we had unfavorable loss experience due to a claims backlog reported by a client and a resulting DAC write off in a credit life product in Brazil, which has since been repriced for some clients and discontinued for other clients. Partially offsetting these increases was income stemming from our completed clients commission reconciliation project. General expenses increased $17,087 due to the continued investment in international expansion as well as costs associated with growth of the domestic service contract business. Policyholder benefits increased $75,088 primarily driven by growth in our international and domestic service contract businesses. This was partially offset by decreased policyholder benefits resulting from the runoff of domestic credit insurance and the terminated accidental death business. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased $65,746, or 49%, to $198,893 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $133,147 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment net income was primarily due to a legal settlement resulting in $40,500 (after tax) of other income and $5,041 (after tax) of one time fee income recognized from a closed block of extended service contract business. This was partially offset by $3,363 (after tax) of lower investment income from real estate partnerships. Absent these events the Solutions segment net income increased $23,568, or 18%, which is primarily attributable to higher fee income resulting from growth in our extended service contract business and an increase in net investment income primarily due to an increase in average invested assets. Total Revenues Total revenues increase $261,426, or 10%, to $2,985,866 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,724,440 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $151,460, primarily in our extended service contract and international businesses. These increases are partially offset by the decrease in the net earned premium in our Preneed business due to the sale of the Independent U.S. distribution channel as well as decreases in other runoff businesses. The increase in revenues was also due to an increase in fees and other income of $89,021, primarily driven by a legal settlement of $62,300 and continued growth from our extended service contract business, including $7,756 of one time fee income from a closed block of extended service contract business. The legal settlement is with a former customer and was first disclosed as a pending legal judgment in our 2004 10 K. Net investment income increased $20,945, or 6%, primarily due to higher average invested assets from growth in our extended service contract businesses both domestically and abroad. We experienced sales growth in most of our product lines, with the exception of our domestic credit and Preneed businesses. Gross written premiums in our domestic credit business decreased $52,675 due to the continued decline of this product line. Gross written premiums from our international credit business increased $32,630 due to growth in our expansion countries. Gross written premiums in our domestic extended service contract business increased $138,065 due to the addition of new clients and growth generated from existing clients. Gross written premiums in our international extended service contract business increased $94,380, mainly due to the continued growth of a client signed in late 2004. We also experienced a decrease in our preneed businesses due to the sale of the U.S. Independent distribution channel in November 2005. 59 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $164,141, or 7%, to $2,688,546 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,524,405 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $212,271. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased $187,036 primarily due to the associated increase in revenues and the change in the mix of business. Commissions increased due to higher commission rates on our increasing extended service contract business versus lower commission rates on the decreasing U.S. Independent Preneed business. General expenses increased $25,235 due to higher expenses directly related to the growth of the business. Policyholder benefits decreased $48,130 primarily as a result of the sale via reinsurance of the U.S. Independent Preneed channel and lower policyholder benefits attributable to the termination of a block of accidental death business. This was offset by an increase in extended service contract policyholder benefits, mostly from growth in the business. Assurant Specialty Property Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Specialty Propertys segment results of operations: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 1,682,266 $ 1,208,311 $ 858,848 Net investment income 100,210 74,501 61,953 Fees and other income 51,256 49,424 38,159 Total revenues 1,833,732 1,332,236 958,960 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 548,873 408,721 317,507 Selling, underwriting and general expenses 701,958 553,452 422,999 Total benefits, losses and expenses 1,250,831 962,173 740,506 Segment income before provision for income tax 582,901 370,063 218,454 Provision for income taxes 203,661 128,942 75,227 Segment net income $ 379,240 $ 241,121 $ 143,227 Net earned premiums and other considerations by major product groupings: Homeowners (Creditor Placed and Voluntary) $ 1,188,090 $ 753,169 $ 443,526 Manufacturing Housing (Creditor Placed and Voluntary) 209,104 214,461 217,424 Other (1) 285,072 240,681 197,898 Total $ 1,682,266 $ 1,208,311 $ 858,848 Ratios: Loss ratio (2) 32.6 % 33.8 % 37.0 % Expense ratio (3) 40.5 % 44.0 % 47.2 % Combined ratio (4) 72.2 % 76.5 % 82.6 % (1) This primarily includes flood, agricultural, specialty auto, and renters insurance products.

(4) The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations and fees and other income. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Income Segment net income increased $138,119, or 57%, to $379,240 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $241,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This increase in net income is primarily due to higher net earned premiums from continued growth in our creditor placed homeowners insurance and continued excellent combined ratios driven by mild weather and our ability to leverage the benefits of scale. Net income also improved due to an increase of $16,711 (after tax) in net investment income as a result of higher average invested assets resulting from the continued growth of the business. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net catastrophe losses of $17,770 (after tax). Total Revenues Total revenues increased $501,496, or 38%, to $1,833,732 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $1,332,236 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenues is mainly due to increased net earned premiums of $473,955, or 39%. The increase is attributable to the growth of the creditor placed homeowners insurance, through both organic growth and acquisitions. The organic growth was primarily driven by the rise in average insured value for property and increased policy placement rates. The increase in net earned premiums was partially offset by increased catastrophe reinsurance premiums of $54,000. Also, net investment income increased $25,709 or 35%, due to higher average invested assets. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $288,658, or 30%, to $1,250,831 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $962,173 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This increase was due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $140,152 and higher selling, underwriting, and general expenses of $148,506. The combined ratio improved to 72.2% from 76.5%, primarily due to the benefits of scale and favorable loss experience. The increase in policyholder benefits is primarily attributable to the corresponding growth in creditor placed homeowners insurance, as well as $27,300 of higher net catastrophe losses from the California wildfires. The increase is also the result of $10,500 of lower National Flood Insurance Program reimbursements in 2007, compared with 2006, which are recorded against policyholder benefits and an $8,500 favorable settlement with two former clients in 2006. These policyholder benefit increases were partially offset by favorable loss experience, absent catastrophe losses. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased $89,445, primarily due to the associated increase in net earned premiums. General expenses increased $59,061 due primarily to increases in employment related expenses consistent with business growth and additional operating expenses associated with the SFIS acquisition. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased $97,894, or 68%, to $241,121 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $143,227 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment net income is primarily due to increased net earned premiums, fee income and improved loss experience in our creditor placed homeowners business, the lack of significant catastrophes in 2006, the acquisition of SFIS and favorable settlements with two former clients of $5,500 (after tax). The increase in net income was partially offset by a reduction in loss adjustment expense reimbursements from the National Flood Insurance Program and one time favorable settlements with clients in 2005. 61 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues increased $373,276 or 39%, to $1,332,236 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $958,960 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily due to an increase in net earned premiums and other considerations of $349,463, or 41%. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our creditor placed and voluntary homeowners product lines, due to continued organic growth of these businesses combined with $123,818 of net earned premiums resulting from the acquisition of SFIS. The increase in revenues was also driven by an increase in fee income of $11,265, or 30%, primarily from growth in creditor placed homeowners loan tracking services. Also contributing to the increase in revenues was higher net investment income of $12,548, or 20%, due to higher invested assets combined with higher investment yields. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $221,667 or 30%, to $962,173 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $740,506 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in policyholder benefits of $91,214 and an increase in selling, underwriting and general expenses of $130,453. The combined ratio decreased to 76.5% from 82.6% to primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and proactive risk management. The increase in policyholder benefits is primarily attributable to the growth in our creditor placed homeowners business and approximately $8,000 in lower reimbursements from the National Flood Insurance Program for the adjudication of expenses related to the 2005 catastrophe flood losses (to $10,500 in 2006 from $18,500 in 2005). This increase is partially offset by lower net catastrophe losses of $42,000 and a favorable settlement with two former clients of $8,500. Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased $69,939, primarily due to the associated increase in revenues combined with approximately $11,400 of one time income recognized in 2005, related to favorable settlements with two clients which resulted in a release of certain accrued commissions. General expenses increased $60,514 due to increases in employment related expenses, consistent with business growth and additional operating expenses associated with the SFIS acquisition. 62 Table of Contents Assurant Health Overview The table below presents information regarding Assurant Healths segment results of operations: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenues: Net earned premiums and other considerations $ 2,050,280 $ 2,083,957 $ 2,163,965 Net investment income 66,634 75,215 69,056 Fees and other income 40,583 41,560 40,344 Total revenues 2,157,497 2,200,732 2,273,365 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 1,295,441 1,300,817 1,344,624 Selling, underwriting and general expenses 627,348 641,328 657,899 Total benefits, losses and expenses 1,922,789 1,942,145 2,002,523 Segment income before provision for income tax 234,708 258,587 270,842 Provision for income taxes 82,965 90,668 92,787 Segment net income $ 151,743 $ 167,919 $ 178,055 Net earned premiums and other considerations: Individual Markets Individual medical $ 1,283,321 $ 1,213,677 $ 1,164,498 Short term medical 96,837 101,454 110,912 Subtotal 1,380,158 1,315,131 1,275,410 Small employer group: 670,122 768,826 888,555 Total $ 2,050,280 $ 2,083,957 $ 2,163,965 Membership by product line: Individual Markets Individual medical 619 641 644 Short term medical 87 87 102 Subtotal 706 728 746 Small employer group: 165 207 255 Total 871 935 1,001 Ratios: Loss ratio (1) 63.2 % 62.4 % 62.1 % Expense ratio (2) 30.0 % 30.2 % 29.8 % Combined ratio (3) 92.0 % 91.4 % 90.8 % (1) The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

The decrease in segment net income was primarily attributable to our small employer group business which experienced continuing declines in net earned premiums and higher claim experience. Also contributing to the decline was lower net investment income, due to lower investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and lower average invested assets. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased $43,235, or 2%, to $2,157,497 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $2,200,732 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual medical business, our targeted growth area, increased $69,644, or 6%, due to new member sales and higher premiums per member. However, this market has become increasingly competitive as established players and new regional entrants are more aggressively targeting this growing segment of the health insurance market. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased $98,705, or 13%, due to a decline in members, partially offset by premium rate increases. The decline in small employer group members is due to increased competition and our adherence to strict underwriting guidelines. Also, net investment income decreased $8,581 due to lower investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and lower average invested assets. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $19,356, or 1%, to $1,922,789 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $1,942,145 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Policyholder benefits decreased $5,376, or less than 1%. This decrease is consistent with the decrease in net earned premiums. Our small employer group business had less favorable loss experience in 2007 compared with 2006. This was offset by our individual medical business which had favorable loss experience. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased $13,980, or 2%, primarily due to lower staffing costs and externally contracted services. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income decreased $10,136, or 6%, to $167,919 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $178,055 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in segment income was primarily attributable to an overall decline in membership due to continued increased competition and our strict adherence to underwriting guidelines. The decrease in net income was partially offset by an increase in investment income from real estate partnerships of $4,900 (after tax). Total Revenues Total revenues decreased $72,633, or 3%, to $2,200,732 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,273,365 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our individual markets business increased $39,721, or 3%, primarily due to premium rate increases. Net earned premiums and other considerations from our small employer group business decreased $119,729, or 13%, due to a decline in members, partially offset by premium rate increases. The small employer group business continues to experience decreases in new business due to increased competition and our strict adherence to underwriting guidelines. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in investment income of $6,159, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in real estate partnership investment income of approximately $7,500. 64 Table of Contents Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $60,378, or 3%, to $1,942,145 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $2,002,523 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Policyholder benefits decreased $43,807, or 3%. The benefit loss ratio increased to 62.4% from 62.1%. The decrease in policyholder benefits was primarily due to the decline in net earned premiums, partially offset by higher claims experience primarily on individual medical business. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased $16,571, or 3%. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to decreased commission expense resulting from the decline in small employer group business.

The increase in net income was primarily driven by additional net investment income of $5,479 (after tax) in 2007 compared with 2006 and continued favorable loss experience, in our group disability business. Partially offsetting these increases were slightly less favorable results in our group life and group dental business. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased $30,277 or 2% to $1,335,691 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $1,365,968 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is primarily a result of lower persistency of large cases over the past several quarters, as the business continues to implement its small case strategy. The decrease in net earned premiums was partially offset by an increase in net investment income of $8,429, or 5%, primarily due to an increase in net investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $35,217 or 3% to $1,202,438 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $1,237,654 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The loss ratio decreased to 69.1% in 2007 from 70.1% in 2006. Our group disability business benefited from favorable loss experience in the current year, driven by continued good incidence and favorable disability recovery rates, which includes claimants who return to work. Group life and group dental experienced slightly less favorable results in 2007 than 2006. The expense ratio increased to 35.2% in 2007 from 34.0% in 2006, due to a decline in net earned premiums as the total amount of expenses remained relatively flat year over year. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income increased $15,237, or 22%, to $83,603 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $68,366 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in segment income was primarily driven by continued favorable group disability experience and improved group dental experience. Disability recovery rates, which include claimants who return to work, and experience in our DRMS channel, were improved. The improvement in loss ratios is partially offset by the decrease in revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased $94,973, or 7%, to $1,365,968 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $1,460,941 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding group disability single premium for closed blocks, net earned premiums and other considerations decreased $117,549 or 9%, from the prior year primarily due to increased lapses and decreased sales. Lapse experience and sales trends reflect the transition to the business small case strategy along with disciplined pricing in a competitive marketplace. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $117,723, or 9%, to $1,237,654 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $1,355,377 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss ratio decreased to 70.1% from 73.2%, primarily due to continued favorable group disability experience. Group disability recovery rates, which include claimants who return to work, and deaths were higher compared to the prior year. Experience in our DRMS channel also improved. Group dental experience has improved primarily due to disciplined pricing 66 Table of Contents actions. The expense ratio increased to 34.0% from 32.2%. The increase in the expense ratio is primarily driven by the decrease in revenues that was proportionally larger than the decrease in general expenses. Selling, underwriting and general expenses have decreased $10,001, or 2%, year over year. In the prior year, we had a non recurring reduction in short term incentive compensation expenses. Excluding the prior year non recurring reduction, selling, general and underwriting expenses have decreased primarily due to expense management consistent with revenue trends. Corporate and Other The table below presents information regarding the Corporate and Other segments results of operations: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenues: Net investment income $ 37,943 $ 35,935 $ 27,794 Net realized (losses) gains on investments (62,220 ) 111,865 8,235 Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses 33,139 37,300 42,508 Fees and other income 746 682 1,432 Total revenues 9,608 185,782 79,969 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 3,969 5 61,943 Selling, underwriting and general expenses 96,703 83,076 96,055 Interest expense 61,178 61,243 61,258 Total benefits, losses and expenses 161,850 144,324 219,256 Segment (loss) income before provision for income taxes (152,242 ) 41,458 (139,287 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (44,063 ) 17,123 (95,847 ) Segment net (loss) income $ (108,179 ) $ 24,335 $ (43,440 ) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net (Loss) Income Segment results decreased $132,514 to a net loss of $108,179 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from net income of $24,335 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This deterioration is mainly due to net realized losses on investments of $62,220, which includes $31,320 (after tax) of write downs of other than temporary declines in our investment portfolio in 2007 compared with 2006 which had net realized gains on investments of $111,865 including a gain of $63,900 (after tax) from the sale of our investment in PHCS. Also, results were negatively impacted by a $3,969 reserve increase related to discontinued products, costs related to an ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products, additional externally contracted services and tax expense related to the change in certain tax liabilities. In addition, there was a continued decline in the amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses due to continued runoff of the businesses sold and a reduction in net investment income due to lower investment income from real estate joint ventures in 2006. Total Revenues Total revenues decreased $176,174, or 95%, to $9,608 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $185,782 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The decline was mainly due to the net realized losses on investments in 2007 compared with net realized gains on investments in 2006, discussed above. In 67 Table of Contents addition, amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses declined $4,161, in connection with the runoff of the businesses sold and net investment income decreased due to $4,856 of investment income in 2006 from a real estate joint venture. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $17,526, or 12%, to $161,850 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 from $144,324 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. This decline was primarily due to $11,503 of expenses related to an ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products, an additional $8,730 of externally contracted services for various ongoing projects and a $3,969 reserve increase related to discontinued products. These negative variances were partially offset by a $3,343 reduction in compensation expenses. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Segment net income improved $67,775, or over 100%, to $24,335 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from a net loss of $43,440 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This improvement is mainly due to a realized gain of $63,900 (after tax) from the sale of our investment in PHCS, a realized gain from the reduction of our mortgage loan loss reserve, strengthening of reserve accruals on certain excess of loss programs in 2005 that did not recur in 2006 and a reduction in stock appreciation rights expense upon adopting FAS 123R. This improvement was partially offset by the 2005 release of $39,400 of previously provided tax accruals which were no longer considered necessary due to the resolution of IRS audits and $5,500 of tax benefit related to the technical correction of tax legislation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) that did not recur in 2006. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $105,813, or over 100%, to $185,782 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $79,969 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Revenues increased mainly due to a $103,630 increase in realized gains on investments primarily due to the sale of our investment in PHCS, resulting in a pre tax gain of $98,300 and a reduction of our mortgage loan loss reserve of $15,168 due to a refinement of managements best estimate of this reserve. Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $74,932, or 34%, to $144,324 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 from $219,256 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. This decrease is primarily due to $61,943 of costs incurred in 2005 on excess of loss reinsurance programs, related to personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance risks, reinsured and ceded by certain subsidiaries in the London market between 1995 and 1997. In addition, stock appreciation rights expense declined, due to the adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. These expense declines were partially offset by a $5,000 contribution to the Assurant Charitable Foundation. 68 Table of Contents Investments The following table shows the carrying value of our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated: As ofDecember 31, 2007 As ofDecember 31, 2006 (in thousands) Fixed maturity securities $ 10,126,415 73 % $ 9,118,049 73 % Equity securities 636,001 5 % 741,639 6 % Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 1,433,626 10 % 1,266,158 10 % Policy loans 57,107 1 % 58,733 1 % Short term investments 410,878 3 % 314,114 3 % Collateral held under securities lending 541,650 4 % 365,958 3 % Other investments 541,474 4 % 564,494 4 % Total investments $ 13,747,151 100 % $ 12,429,145 100 % Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 69% and 67% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities rated A or better as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. As interest rates increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities decreases. The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains (losses), pre tax, on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as of the dates indicated: As ofDecember 31, 2007 As ofDecember 31, 2006 Fixed maturity securities: Amortized cost $ 10,026,355 $ 8,934,017 Net unrealized gains 100,060 184,032 Fair value $ 10,126,415 $ 9,118,049 Equities: Cost $ 702,698 $ 735,566 Net unrealized (losses) gains (66,697 ) 6,073 Fair value $ 636,001 $ 741,639 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased $83,972 from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. The decrease in net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to widening credit spreads during third and fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by decreases in treasury yields. Ten year A rated corporate spreads, which started the year at 80 basis points over treasury securities, increased to 160 basis points over treasury securities in the fourth quarter of 2007. The yield on 10 year treasury securities decreased 61 basis points between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased $72,770 from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to credit spreads widening in the preferred stock sector. The Merrill Lynch Preferred Stock Hybrid Index decreased 18.6% between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Net investment income increased $62,387, or 8%, to $799,073 at December 31, 2007 from $736,686 at December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets and $37,173 of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships in 2007 compared to $18,578 in 2006. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships, was 5.69% in 2007 compared to 5.67% in 2006. 69 Table of Contents Net investment income increased $49,429, or 7%, to $736,686 at December 31, 2006 from $687,257 at December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in yields and average invested assets. Net investment income includes $18,578 of investment income from real estate partnerships in 2006 compared to $12,565 in 2005. The yield on average invested assets and cash and cash equivalents, which excludes investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships, was 5.67% in 2006 compared to 5.54% in 2005. We recorded $48,184, $810 and $765 of pre tax realized losses in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with other than temporary declines in value of available for sale securities. Over the last six months of 2007 the fixed maturity security and equity security markets have experienced significant volatility. This volatility has primarily been due to declines in the housing market, credit availability, as well as a general economic slowdown. As a result, certain securities directly exposed to these factors have had market value declines. In connection with this volatility, we recorded $6,699 and $41,485 of pre tax other than temporary impairments during the three months ended September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Included in these amounts are $31,908, $6,721, $2,201 and $1,309 related to banks and financial institutions, real estate investment trusts, paper/forestry companies and home builders, respectively.

The total unrealized losses represent less than 5% and 2% of the aggregate fair value of the related securities at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Approximately 75% and 35% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As discussed previously, the financial markets have experienced considerable volatility over the last six months of 2007. Due to this fact, securities in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, has increased significantly in 2007, compared with 2006. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 1,282 and 1,394 individual securities with 77% and 94% of the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than $200 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than six months but less than 12 months were approximately $115,926 and $12,327 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no securities with an unrealized loss of greater than $200 having a market value below 67% and 88% of book value at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, 27% of the unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities were concentrated in the banking industry with no exposure to any single issuer in the banking industry in excess of 3% of total unrealized losses. The amortized cost and fair value of available for sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2007, by contractual maturity, is shown below: Cost orAmortized Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 178,960 $ 177,630 Due after one year through five years 541,439 529,038 Due after five years through ten years 1,151,566 1,115,669 Due after ten years 1,785,131 1,696,801 Total 3,657,096 3,519,138 Mortgage backed securities 332,788 326,721 Total $ 3,989,884 $ 3,845,859 71 Table of Contents As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. We have reviewed these securities and recorded $48,184, $810 and $765 of additional other than temporary impairments as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Due to issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition, we believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2007 in the sectors discussed above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities were purchased. We have the ability and intent to hold these assets until the date of recovery. Therefore, the decision to sell any security in an unrealized loss position reflects the judgment of management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. The following table represents our exposure to sub prime and related mortgages within our fixed maturity portfolio as well as the current net unrealized (loss) position at December 31, 2007.

This represents 0.8% and 1.7% of the total fixed maturity portfolio and 1.6% and 0.1% of the total unrealized loss position at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the securities with sub prime exposure, all are investment grade rated. We have no sub prime exposure to collateralized debt obligations as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. All mortgage backed securities, including those with sub prime exposure, are reviewed as part of the ongoing other than temporary impairment monitoring process. Loss Protection and Capital Management As part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional business. 72 Table of Contents For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by geographic area. We have entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events. Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks. Business Dispositions To exit certain businesses, we have used reinsurance to facilitate transactions because the businesses share legal entities with operating segments we retain. Assets supporting liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held in trusts and the separate accounts relating to divested business are still reflected in our balance sheet. Segments Client Risk and Profit Sharing The Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property segments write business produced by clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business. A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risk related to business generated by certain clients to the clients captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client generated business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiarys domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full statutory financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some of the factors used in 73 Table of Contents determining the amount of capital used for dividends. For 2008, the maximum amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval for our statutory subsidiaries, is approximately $445,154. Liquidity Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $436,900, $554,270 and $530,094 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, and to repurchase our outstanding shares. The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income. We conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance with formal Company wide Asset Liability Management (ALM) guidelines. To complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a large, varied set of plausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. Alternative asset portfolio structures are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk preference. Sensitivity testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed. Given our ALM asset allocation processes and the nature of the products we offer, we have minimal exposure to disintermediation risk. Our liabilities have limited policyholder optionality which results in policyholder behavior that is mainly insensitive to the interest rate environment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. Generally, our subsidiaries premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. However, there are instances where unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds including selling assets from the subsidiaries investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper and drawing funds from our revolving credit facility. We consider the permanence of the cash need as well as the cost of each source of funds in determining which option to utilize. On January 25, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per common share payable on March 10, 2008 to stockholders of record as of February 25, 2008. We paid dividends of $0.10 per common share on March 12, 2007 and $0.12 per common share on June 12, 2007, September 11, 2007 and December 10, 2007. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries payment of dividends and or other statutorily permissible 74 Table of Contents payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits We sponsor a pension and a retirement health benefit plan covering our employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases. We determine these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing our related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of our aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. The assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. Our qualified pension plan was over funded by $30,283 at December 31, 2007. We established a funding policy for our qualified pension plan in which service cost plus 15% of plan deficit will be contributed annually, if needed. We made $46,117 of discretionary pension plan contributions in 2007. See Note 21 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the components of the net periodic benefit cost. Commercial Paper Program We maintain a $500,000 commercial paper program, which is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our commercial paper program is rated AMB 2 by A.M. Best, P 2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (successor by merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. In April 2005, we amended and restated our $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan Chase Bank. The amended and restated credit facility is unsecured and is available until April 2010, so long as we are in compliance with all the covenants. This facility is also available for general corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at December 31, 2007. We did not use the revolving credit facility during 2007 and no amounts are outstanding. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. We are in compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds. Senior Notes On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single installment due February 15, 2034. Our senior notes are rated bbb by A.M. Best, Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by S&P. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The senior notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. 75 Table of Contents In managements opinion, our subsidiaries cash flow from operations together with our income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows We monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. The table below shows our recent net cash flows: For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (1) $ 1,212,454 $ 931,424 $ 902,947 Investing activities (1,208,585 ) (84,511 ) (548,688 ) Financing activities (186,577 ) (714,810 ) (305,772 ) Net change in cash $ (182,708 ) $ 132,103 $ 48,487 (1) Includes effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,212,454 and $931,424 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $281,030 increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the increase in gross written premiums from our extended service contracts and creditor placed homeowners businesses and lower claim payments related to hurricane losses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $931,424 and $902,947 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $28,477 increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily due to cash provided by reinsurance recoverables relating to settlements for 2005 hurricane losses offset by a decrease in accounts payable. Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $1,208,585 and $84,511 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $1,124,074 increase in net cash used in investing activities is mainly due to net purchases of fixed maturity securities. In addition, the increase is also attributable to changes in collateral held under securities lending and short term investments, as well as the impact on cash used for the acquisitions of Centrepoint, Swansure and Mayflower. Net cash used in investing activities was $84,511 and $548,688 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $464,177 decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily attributable to significant net cash received from the sale of short term investments in 2006 compared to cash used to purchase short term investments for the comparable period in 2005. Also, the net cash received from the SFIS acquisition, a decrease in cash outflows for investments in commercial mortgage loans on real estate and the cash received from the sale of PHCS, partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase fixed maturities, contributed to the overall decrease in cash used in investing activities. 76 Table of Contents Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $186,577 and $714,810 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $528,233 decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to changes in collateral held under securities lending. Net cash used in financing activities was $714,810 and $305,772 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $409,039 increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in net cash used to purchase treasury stock and a change in collateral held under securities lending. The table below shows our cash outflows for distributions and dividends for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Security Interest paid on mandatory redeemable preferred stock and debt $ 61,089 $ 61,159 $ 61,179 Common stock dividends 55,038 48,157 42,050 Total $ 116,127 $ 109,316 $ 103,229 Commitments and Contingencies We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of December 31, 2007, are detailed in the table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, Less than 1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than 5Years Total (in thousands) Contractual obligations : Insurance liabilities (1) $ 1,788,407 $ 1,606,331 $ 1,410,157 $ 12,033,510 $ 16,838,405 Debt and related interest 60,188 120,375 120,375 1,616,251 1,917,189 Mandatory redeemable preferred stock 21,160 21,160 Operating leases 37,792 54,455 22,403 24,401 139,051 Pension obligations and postretirement benefit 31,926 68,293 73,828 260,164 434,211 Commitments: Investment purchases outstanding: Unsettled trades 10,733 10,733 Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 30,910 30,910 Other investments 25,000 25,000 FIN 48 liability 2,151 15,901 18,052 Total obligations and commitments $ 1,987,107 $ 1,849,454 $ 1,642,664 $ 13,955,486 $ 19,434,711 (1) Insurance liabilities, reflected in the commitments and contingencies table above, include products for which we are currently making periodic payments and products for which we are not making periodic payments, but for which we believe the amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and determinable. Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. 77 Table of Contents Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of $7,189,496 and claims and benefits payable of $3,303,084 have been included in the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments. Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had approximately $31,813 and $33,219 of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both our customers and stockholders interests. We are exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the market value of investments in response to changes in interest rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other factors. Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed maturity investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance recoverables. Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation. Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in which we expect the liabilities to be paid. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease in 78 Table of Contents prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment. We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Our group long term disability reserves are also sensitive to interest rates. Group long term disability and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity relating to price risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the yield curves. We have assumed that the United States and Canadian yield curve shifts are of equal direction and magnitude. The individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as callable bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis for bonds and mortgage backed securities held in our investment portfolio: Interest Rate Movement Analysis of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2007 100 50 0 50 100 (in thousands) Total market value $ 10,853,555 $ 10,481,322 $ 10,126,415 $ 9,789,717 $ 9,470,183 % Change in market value from base case 7.18 % 3.50 % % 3.32 % 6.48 % $ Change in market value from base case $ 727,140 $ 354,907 $ $ (336,698 ) $ (656,232 ) The interest rate sensitivity relating to reinvestment risk of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical scenarios that assume purchases in the primary market and considers the effects of interest rates on sales.

Our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis on our reported portfolio yield: Interest Rate Movement Analysis Of Portfolio Yield of Fixed Maturity Securities Investment Portfolio As of December 31, 2007 100 50 0 50 100 Portfolio Yield 5.85 % 5.92 % 5.99 % 6.06 % 6.13 % Basis Point Change in Portfolio Yield (0.14 )% (0.07 )% % 0.07 % 0.14 % 79 Table of Contents Credit Risk We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers rated AA and above, 1% for issuers rated A to A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements. We use the lower of Moodys or S&Ps ratings to determine an issuers rating. The following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2007: Rating Fair Value Percentage ofTotal (in thousands) Aaa/Aa/A $ 6,917,249 69 % Baa 2,570,640 25 % Ba 492,822 5 % B and lower 145,704 1 % Total $ 10,126,415 100 % We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments as described above under Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reinsurance. For at least 50% of our $3,904,348 of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2007, we are protected from the credit risk by using various types of risk mitigation mechanisms such as trusts, letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or co funds withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of $1,305,718 and $1,473,312 as of December 31, 2007 relating to two large coinsurance arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively, related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in these trusts falls below the value of the associated liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes questionable. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. We believe that a majority of our remaining reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated A or better by A.M. Best. Inflation Risk Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation. Approximately 10% of Assurant preneeds insurance policies with reserves of approximately $381,863 as of December 31, 2007 have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in 80 Table of Contents an adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing contracts with payments tied to the CPI. See Derivatives. In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the Canadian dollar, primarily the British pound and Danish krone. However, total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were less than 2% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2007. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets denominated in Canadian dollars on our entire fixed maturity portfolio is summarized in the following table: Foreign Exchange Movement Analysis Of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Assets As of December 31, 2007 Foreign exchange spot rate at December 31, 2007, US Dollar toCanadian Dollar 10% 5% 0 5% 10% Total market value $ 10,028,240 $ 10,077,327 $ 10,126,415 $ 10,175,503 $ 10,224,590 % change of market value from base case (0.97 )% (0.48 )% % 0.48 % 0.97 % $ change of market value from base case $ (98,175 ) $ (49,088 ) $ $ 49,088 $ 98,175 The foreign exchange risk sensitivity of our consolidated net income is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume earnings in Canadian dollars are recognized evenly throughout a period. Our actual results may differ from the results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the methodology.

Derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments. We have purchased contracts to cap the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our preneed insurance policies. In 2003, we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. 36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments (DIG B36), we bifurcated the contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with adoption of DIG B36, we reclassified the invested assets related to this modified coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in other investments. The combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 82 Table of Contents
