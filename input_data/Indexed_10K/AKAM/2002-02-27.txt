Overview Akamai provides secure, outsourced e business infrastructure services and software solutions. We market our services and software worldwide through a direct sales force and a reseller channel. Our services and software enable enterprises to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a uniform Web infrastructure while ensuring superior performance, reliability, scalability and manageability. We were formed in August 1998 and began selling our content delivery services commercially in April 1999. We ended 1999 with approximately 227 customers under recurring contract. During 2000 we acquired the businesses of Network24 and InterVu. We recorded a total of $2.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions. In October 2000, we launched our EdgeSuite offering, a suite of services that allows for the high performance, dynamic delivery of Web content and applications to end users, wherever they are located globally. The following significant events occurred in 2001: as a result of a reduction in our market capitalization and other factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 billion to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the acquisitions of Network24 and InterVu to its fair value; in an effort to better align our costs with forecasted revenue, we recorded a restructuring charge of $40.5 million to reflect the severance of approximately 400 employees and the termination of leases related to excess office space; we increased our EdgeSuite customer base to 152 and we ended the year with 1,214 customers under recurring contracts; and 19 Table of Contents by the end of the year our intelligent edge platform was comprised of more than 13,500 servers within over 1,000 networks in 63 countries. We have incurred significant costs to develop our technology, build our worldwide network, sell and market our services and software and support our operations. We have also incurred significant amortization expense of goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of businesses. Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future. We believe that our success is dependent on increasing our customer base, developing new services and software that leverage our proprietary technology and maintaining a proper alignment between our cost structure, particularly our cash operating expenses and our revenue goals. In order to achieve these goals, we expect to incur sales, marketing, engineering and development and general and administrative costs in the future at amounts similar to the amounts incurred in 2001. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, depreciable lives of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingency accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue from our services and licenses when an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service or license has been established, the service or license has been delivered to and accepted by the customer, the fee for the service or license is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from our content delivery and streaming services based on the customers minimum monthly usage commitment plus usage in excess of the minimum commitment as defined in the service arrangement. We record installation and set up fees as deferred revenue and recognize these fees ratably over the life of the customer contract. We recognize revenue from resellers based on the resellers contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitment, plus amounts sold by the resellers to their customers in excess of the minimum commitment. We recognize revenue from professional services as these services are performed. From time to time, we enter into contracts to purchase goods or services for our operations from customers at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to sell services or license software to these organizations. These transactions are separately negotiated and recorded at terms we consider to be arms length. For all periods presented, revenue recognized from vendors where we purchased goods or services from the vendor at or about the same time that we entered into contracts to sell services or license software was less than 10% of total revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. When estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze our accounts receivable aging, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and other factors. If the collection of accounts receivable is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition. Cost of Service. We include in cost of service the fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and fees for housing our servers in third party network data centers. Cost of service also includes network storage costs; live event costs including costs for production, encoding and signal acquisition; and costs of professional 20 Table of Contents services. We include the depreciation on network equipment used to deliver our services in depreciation on the consolidated statements of operations. We enter into contracts for bandwidth with third party network providers with terms typically ranging from one to three years. These contracts generally commit us to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted level and, in some instances, commit us to share with the third party network providers a portion of the revenue recognized from customers that use these third party networks. In some circumstances, ISPs make available to Akamai rack space for our servers and access to their bandwidth at discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISPs customers benefit by receiving content through a local Akamai server resulting in better content delivery. We do not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an earnings process. Accordingly, we do not recognize as revenue the value to the ISPs associated with the use of our servers and we do not recognize as expense the value of the rack space and bandwidth received at discounted or no cost. Investments. We review all investments for reductions in fair value that are other than temporary. We consider several factors when determining whether such reductions are other than temporary, including the financial condition and results of operations of the investee and the amount of time the fair value of the investment has been below cost. When such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through loss on investments on the consolidated statements of operations. We adjust our marketable securities to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income. We disclose the value of restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. We review goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such triggering events occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the long lived assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to those assets. If this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we reclassified to goodwill the carrying amount of our assembled workforce intangible asset. The resulting balance of goodwill was $4.9 million on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we are required to perform a transitional impairment test on goodwill by assigning goodwill to reporting units, determining the fair value of the reporting units and comparing that fair value to the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting units, including goodwill. We have determined that Akamai has one reporting unit. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2002 for purposes of performing the transitional impairment test. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the market capitalization of Akamai as of January 1, 2002. The fair value was compared to the recognized and unrecognized net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit. Accordingly, we concluded that no further impairment analysis was necessary. We have designated January 1 as the date for our annual impairment test. Unless changes in events and circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required, we expect to test goodwill for impairment again on January 1, 2003. Related Party Transactions. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with parties that have relationships with our officers or directors or entities in which we have an ownership interest. Such transactions are reviewed by the Board of Directors and are subject to the prior approval of members of the Board of Directors who do not have a personal interest in the applicable transaction. We disclose all material transactions that, in our judgment, constitute related party transactions. Related parties include our subsidiaries, investments accounted for under the equity method, members of our management and owners of a significant percentage of our common stock and their family members, and any other party that we significantly influence. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. We provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize our 21 Table of Contents deferred tax assets in excess of their carrying amounts, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling of interests method. SFAS No. 141 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which became effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which will be effective for fiscal year 2003. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We deploy servers in third party networks and data centers worldwide under various co location contracts. Many of these contracts require the physical removal, at our expense, of servers from the data centers at the conclusion of the contract. We are reviewing whether these removal requirements constitute an asset retirement obligation under SFAS No. 143. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which became effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2001 2000 1999 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of service (excludes network related depreciation included in depreciation below) 33.8 46.8 170.9 Engineering and development (excludes equity related compensation disclosed separately below) 37.7 61.9 294.7 Sales, general and administrative (excludes equity related compensation disclosed separately below) 89.5 170.0 713.1 Depreciation 45.2 39.6 85.0 Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and acquired in process research and development 156.7 754.7 1.2 Equity related compensation 19.3 29.1 251.0 Impairment of goodwill 1,172.0 Restructuring charge 24.8 Total cost and operating expenses 1,579.0 1,102.1 1,515.9 Loss from operations (1,479.0 ) (1,002.1 ) (1,415.9 ) Interest (expense) income, net (4.0 ) 15.6 56.9 Other income 0.6 Losses in equity method investment (1.2 ) Loss on investments (7.9 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (1,491.5 ) (986.5 ) (1,359.0 ) Provision for income taxes 0.7 0.3 Net loss before extraordinary loss (1,492.2 )% (986.8 )% (1,359.0 )% Revenue. Revenue increased to $163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Revenue increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in our average recurring customer base which grew from approximately 800 to 1,300 during 2001, a change in our customer mix toward larger enterprise customers and away from emerging Internet based businesses and a shift in our service mix toward higher priced services. These factors contributed approximately $54.3 million to 2001 revenue growth. Revenue also increased in 2001 due to an increase in license revenue, which contributed $6.7 million to 2001 revenue growth, and an increase in service and license revenue with related parties, which contributed $12.4 million to 2001 revenue growth. Revenue increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to an increase in our average recurring customer base. For each of the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, over 90% of our revenue was derived from customers located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2001, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2000, one customer, Apple Computer, accounted for 12% of total revenue. In April 2001, we re signed Apple Computer to a one year contract. We do not expect that revenue from Apple Computer will exceed 10% of total revenue for any future period. For the year ended December 31, 1999, Apple Computer and Yahoo! accounted for 22% and 13% of total revenue, respectively. Cost of Service. Cost of service increased to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Cost of service increased in each year primarily due to higher bandwidth costs as a result of the expansion of our network and the increased amount of content delivered over our network. Gross margins, excluding network related depreciation, were 66.2%, 53.2% and (70.9)% for the years ended 23 Table of Contents December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gross margins increased in each period due to a decline in the ratio of bandwidth costs to our service prices and an increase in licensing revenue. Gross margins on our service revenue, excluding network related depreciation, were 59.3%, 48.2% and (70.9)% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our long range gross margin target is 65% 70%. We believe that in order to achieve this objective, we must closely manage our bandwidth contracts, terminate unprofitable service agreements with customers and maintain the price levels of our services. Engineering and Development. Engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses and other costs related to the design, development, testing, deployment, operation, monitoring and enhancement of our services and our network. To date, we have expensed engineering and development costs as incurred. We believe that product development is critical to our future objectives and we intend to continue to enhance our technology to meet the challenging requirements of market demand. Engineering and development expenses were $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Engineering and development expenses increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to increased personnel and payroll related expenses as a result of increased average headcount in the engineering organization, partially offset by a decrease in consulting, temporary employees and recruiting expenses. Engineering and development expenses increased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in personnel and payroll related expenses as a result of increased headcount in the engineering organization. We do not expect the amount of engineering and development expenses to increase during 2002 as compared to 2001. Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for marketing, sales, operations and finance personnel, sales commissions, fees for professional services, advertising costs, provision for doubtful accounts and rent expense for leased properties. SG&A expenses were $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $152.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. SG&A decreased in 2001 primarily due to decreased travel expenditures, recruiting expenditures and advertising expenses, partially offset by increased personnel and payroll related expenses due to an increase in average headcount, increased provision for doubtful accounts and increased insurance and legal expenses. SG&A expenses increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to increased personnel and payroll related expenses as a result of increases in headcount to support our growth. We do not expect the amount of SG&A to increase during 2002 as compared to 2001. Depreciation. Depreciation expense consists of depreciation of our network equipment and property and equipment used by us internally. Depreciation expense was $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Depreciation expense increased in each year primarily as a result of the expansion of our network. We do not expect depreciation expense to increase substantially in 2002 as compared to 2001. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, including goodwill, acquired in business combinations. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was $255.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $676.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased in 2001 as compared to 2000 due to a write off of goodwill as a result of an impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2001 as described under the heading Impairment of Goodwill below. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to acquisitions of businesses in 2000. We expect amortization of other intangible assets to decrease significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001. We will cease to amortize goodwill as of January 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Acquired In Process Research and Development. Acquired in process research and development, which we refer to as IPR&D, consists of a charge of $1.4 million in 2000 for the value of development projects acquired from InterVu, which we acquired in April 2000, that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. IPR&D was identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by management regarding products under development. Development projects that had reached 24 Table of Contents technological feasibility were classified as completed technology and are being amortized over three years. Projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses were classified as IPR&D and were charged to expense on the date of the acquisition. The value of IPR&D was determined based on each projects stage of development, the time and resources needed for completion, the contribution of core technology and the projected discounted cash flows of completed products. The discount rate was determined considering our weighted average cost of capital and the risks surrounding the successful completion of the projects under development. Equity Related Compensation. Equity related compensation expense was $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Equity related compensation expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an employee stock option exchange offer that was completed in May 2001 and that increased deferred compensation by $36.1 million. For additional information on the exchange offer, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Equity related compensation increased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily as a result of the acceleration of stock option vesting for a number of terminated employees. The balance of deferred compensation as of December 31, 2001 was $38.9 million. We expect to fully amortize this balance to equity related compensation expense over the next three years. Impairment of Goodwill. Impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects a charge of $1,912.8 million to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisitions of Network24 and InterVu to its fair value as of March 31, 2001. We periodically review goodwill and other long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair value. We consider several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including Akamais market capitalization in relation to its book value, the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses. A review of these factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was required for long lived assets of acquired businesses. We grouped all long lived assets for acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these long lived assets. The discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,912.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value. Restructuring charge. Restructuring charges were $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In April 2001, we terminated approximately 150 employees from all areas of the Company and commenced the termination and subleasing of excess office space under non cancelable operating leases. As a result of these actions, we recorded a restructuring charge of $26.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2001. In October 2001, we reduced our workforce by an additional 250 employees and vacated additional operating leases. As a result, we recorded a restructuring charge of $14.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2001. We expect that these actions will result in salary and personnel related savings of approximately $35.0 million over the next fiscal year. These charges were measured based on: the amount of severance and other expenses related to terminated employees; the estimated amount of future rent payments for permanently vacated operating leases, less estimated sublease income; the estimated amount of lease termination fees; and the estimated amount of impaired leasehold improvements located in vacated facilities. As of December 31, 2001, we had paid substantially all of the severance liability. We plan to complete the consolidation and subleasing of office space as soon as possible, subject to market and other conditions. We expect that we will complete the restructuring plan within one year. 25 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2001, we had made $11.6 million of cash payments against the restructuring liability. The restructuring liability is summarized below (in millions): Leasehold Leases Improvements Severance Total Restructuring charge for the year ended December 31, 2001 $ 34.1 $ 1.3 $ 5.1 $ 40.5 Cash payments through December 31, 2001 (6.5 ) (5.1 ) (11.6 ) Non cash charge (1.3 ) (1.3 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2001 $ 27.6 $ $ $ 27.6 The restructuring liability related to non cancelable operating leases is based on then available market data and discussions with our lessors. In the event that these operating leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2001, we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability through a restructuring charge. Interest Income. Interest income consists of interest earned on invested cash balances, which are invested in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations and high quality corporate obligations. Interest income was $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest income decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of a decrease in our invested cash. Interest income increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to investment of the proceeds from the issuance of our $300 million 5 1/2% convertible notes issued in June 2000 and from our initial public offering in October 1999. We expect interest income to decrease in 2002 as a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance. Interest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest paid on our debt obligations and the amortization of deferred financing costs. Interest expense was $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest expense increased in 2001 compared with 2000 and increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of interest expense accrued on our 5 1/2% convertible notes. We expect interest expense to remain approximately the same in 2002 as compared to 2001. Other Income. We received $1.0 million in proceeds from a key person life insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of Daniel M. Lewin, our co founder. Losses in Equity Method Investment. Losses in equity method investment of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects our share of the losses in Sockeye. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of Sockeye. Loss on Investments. Loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes a realized loss of $2.8 million from the sale of an investment in the preferred stock of a private company and $10.2 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value as a result of a decline in the values of those investments that, in the opinion of management, was other than temporary. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources Prior to our initial public offering in October 1999, we financed our operations primarily through private sales of our capital stock and issuance of senior subordinated notes totaling approximately $124.6 million in net proceeds through December 31, 1999. In October 1999, we sold shares of common stock through our initial public offering. Net proceeds to us from the initial public offering were $217.6 million after deducting an aggregate of $16.4 million in underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters. Since our initial public offering, we have funded our operations through the cash raised in our initial public offering, cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our 5 1/2% convertible notes. 26 Table of Contents In June 2000, we issued $300.0 million of 5 1/2% convertible notes for aggregate net proceeds of $290.2 million. The notes are due July 1, 2007 and are convertible any time, at the option of the holders, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $115.47 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. In January 2001, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will enable us to sell up to $500 million of equity or debt securities in one or more public offerings. To date, we have not offered or sold any securities under this registration statement. In addition, we have secured approximately $10 million in equipment financing for future capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2001, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $210.5 million, $29.0 million of which was restricted by letters of credit issued in favor of third party beneficiaries, principally related to operating leases. Cash used in operating activities was $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash used in operating activities in 2001 reflects an increase in losses from operations before non cash expenses such as amortization, depreciation and equity related compensation, and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in current liabilities and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Cash used in operating activities in 2001 also includes payments against our restructuring liability of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We expect to make payments against our restructuring liability of at least $17.6 million over the next 12 months and $10.0 million thereafter. Payments against our restructuring liability may be higher if we are unable to terminate certain abandoned real estate operating leases at expected rates or we are unable to obtain sublease income on such properties. Cash used in operating activities in 2000 and 1999 reflects losses from operations prior to non cash expenses and an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities. We expect cash flows from operating activities to be negative through at least the next 12 months. Cash provided by investing activities was $39.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2001. Cash used in investing activities was $316.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash provided by investing activities in 2001 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $103.8 million and purchases of property and equipment of $64.5 million, consisting primarily of servers for the deployment and expansion of our network and information systems used to operate our business. Cash used in investing activities in 2000 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $201.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $131.9 million and cash acquired from the acquisition of business of $17.2 million. Cash used in investing activities in 1999 consists primarily of purchases of property and equipment. We expect capital expenditures to decrease significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001. We expect to finance future capital expenditures through current cash and marketable securities or vendor financing. Cash provided by financing activities was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, $320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $321.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 consists of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans and the repayment of notes receivable from officers for stock, partially offset by payments against capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities in 2000 consists primarily of the sale of our 5 1/2% convertible notes and the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash provided by financing activities in 1999 primarily reflects the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and the sale of convertible preferred stock. We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures on both a short term and long term basis. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or 27 Table of Contents convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results.

See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. We place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations, high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit. An increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 to 200 basis points would not materially affect the fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2001. We expect to hold our marketable debt securities until maturity and do not expect to realize significant losses on the sale of marketable debt securities prior to maturity. We also hold investments in the common or preferred stock of several public and private companies. The carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2001 was $7.7 million. Due to the limited operating history of these companies we may not be able to recover our initial investment. Our 5 1/2% convertible notes are subject to changes in market value. As of December 31, 2001, the carrying amount and market value of these notes were $300.0 million and $156.0 million, respectively. We have foreign operations in Europe and we have established a joint venture in Japan. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, we do not expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. 28 Table of Contents
