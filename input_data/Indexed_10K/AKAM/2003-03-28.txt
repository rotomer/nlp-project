Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2002 2001 2000 Revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenue 59 66 80 Research and development 15 28 43 Sales and marketing 45 57 124 General and administrative 68 75 101 Amortization of other intangible assets 8 11 14 Amortization of goodwill 145 739 Restructuring charges 31 25 Impairment of goodwill 1,172 Acquired in process research and development 1 Total cost and operating expenses 226 1,579 1,102 Loss from operations (126 ) (1,479 ) (1,002 ) Interest income 2 7 25 Interest expense (13 ) (11 ) (10 ) Other income 1 Loss on investments, net (4 ) (9 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (141 ) (1,491 ) (987 ) Provision for income taxes 1 Net loss (141 )% (1,492 )% (987 )% Since our inception, we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology, build our worldwide network, sell and market our services and software and support our operations. We have also incurred significant amortization expense and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of businesses. In recent years, we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and vacated facilities under long term leases. Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses over at least the next 12 to 18 months. As of December 31, 2002, we had $300 million of convertible notes outstanding, which become due in 2007. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $125.2 million, of which $13.4 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash. We believe that our success is dependent on increasing our net monthly recurring revenue, developing new services and software that leverage our proprietary technology and achieving and maintaining a proper alignment between our revenue and our cost structure. We consider net additions to monthly recurring revenue to be a critical success factor for our business. We define net monthly recurring revenue as new bookings of recurring revenue less lost recurring revenue due to customer cancellations, non renewals or collections issues. A typical recurring revenue contract has a term of one to two years. As of December 31, 2002, our net monthly recurring revenue under contract was greater than such amount at December 31, 2001. We continue to sell our services and software into a depressed information technology market. We are also experiencing competitive pricing pressures on our service offerings. Due to these and other factors, our ability to predict our future revenue results is limited, and there is no guarantee that net monthly recurring revenue under contract will continue to increase. 16 Table of Contents Our ability to maintain gross margins that fall within our target range is also critical to our success. Accordingly, we are continuously managing our network costs by entering into competitively priced bandwidth and colocation contracts that are aligned with our revenue forecasts and our estimates as to the amount of traffic we expect to carry over our network. As a result, we have been successful in maintaining our gross margins despite pricing pressure on our service offerings. We have taken steps to align our recurring operating expenses with our revenue and gross margins. Our recurring operating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. These expenses were $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $259.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $239.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we undertook actions to reduce our overall cost structure, including employee severances, while maintaining a high level of employee productivity and customer service. As a result, we expect the downward trend in these operating expenses to continue. Our operating expenses also include restructuring charges. We incurred restructuring charges of $45.8 million and $40.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These expenses relate to actual and estimated termination and modification costs on leases for excess facilities and employee severance costs. We may incur restructuring charges in the future depending on several factors, including the timing and amount of any lease modifications and terminations, the timing and amount of any sublease receipts, and any future employee severances. We expect that, if successful, our efforts to terminate and modify our excess facility leases will require a significant amount of cash in the future. Recent Events In October 2002, we reduced our workforce by 29%, or approximately 200 employees, across all functional areas. Accordingly, we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $3.6 million for one time benefit payments to affected employees. As a result of these actions, we expect operating costs to decline in 2003 from previous levels. In November 2002, Robert Cobuzzi became our Chief Financial Officer following the resignation of our former Chief Financial Officer, Timothy Weller. In November 2002, we settled a stock price appreciation guarantee to CNN News Group, or CNN, by making a $2.7 million cash payment to CNN and allowing CNN to draw on a $3.8 million letter of credit previously issued by us. We acquired the obligation as part of our acquision of InterVu, Inc. in April 2000. The settlement was accounted for as an adjustment to the fair value of the common stock for the amount of additional cash issued. Consequently, the total purchase price was not adjusted. In December 2002, we sold our 40% joint venture interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK to Softbank Broadmedia Corporation, or SBBM. Prior to the sale, SBBM had owned a 60% interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK. We expect that SBBM will operate the entity as a non exclusive reseller of our services in Japan. As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of $400,000 in loss on investments, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. In January 2003, we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary in Japan through which we sell our services and support our reseller arrangements. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the new subsidiary will be consolidated into our future quarterly and annual financial statements. In January 2003, we paid $2.5 million, including interest, to a former employee of an acquired company as a result of an April 2001 judgment against the acquired company for breach of contract. We have included this amount in accrued expenses as of December 31, 2002. In February 2003, we settled an employment related lawsuit with multiple claims brought by a former employee for a cash payment of $3.6 million. Our insurance carrier reimbursed us for $1.8 million of such settlement expense. As of December 31, 2002, to reflect this settlement, we have included $3.6 million in accrued expenses and $1.8 million in current assets, and we recorded the net amount of $1.8 million in general and administrative expenses. 17 Table of Contents Change in Presentation of Consolidated Statement of Operations Expense Categories In 2002, we modified the presentation of our consolidated statements of operations. All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. These modifications had no impact on loss from operations or net loss. We modified certain expense categories as follows: We included in cost of revenue the salaries, benefits and other direct costs of employees who operate our network. These costs were previously included under the engineering and development category. We disaggregated our sales, general and administrative category into two categories: sales and marketing and general and administrative. We moved internal information technology and network operation costs from engineering and development to general and administrative and cost of revenue, respectively. Our engineering and development organization became known as our research and development organization. In addition, we simplified the presentation of the consolidated statement of operations as follows: We included equity related compensation in cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative based on the functional role of the related employee. We included the depreciation and amortization on our network equipment and internal use software used to deliver our services in cost of revenue. We included the depreciation and amortization of all other property and equipment in general and administrative. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, depreciable lives of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the specific manner that we apply those principals, that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. We define a critical accounting estimate as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 18 Table of Contents Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from our services when: an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service has been established; the service or license has been delivered to and accepted (when applicable) by the customer; the fee for the service or license is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. At the inception of a customer contract, we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured. We base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check, financial review or the receipt of a deposit from the customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, assuming the other criteria are met. If we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received. We also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer. Changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize. Concurrent Transactions: From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with an enterprise at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprise. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the fair value to us of the vendors product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is assumed probable. Investments: We periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other than temporary. We consider several factors that may trigger an other than temporary decline in value, such as the length of time the investments value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest. When we conclude that the reduction is other than temporary, the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other than temporary would increase loss on investments. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long Lived Assets: We review our long lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets. Changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially. Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility Leases: When we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred 19 Table of Contents under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard, we will record a restructuring liability, discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease. When we record a restructuring liability, we make critical estimates related to the amount of rent or termination costs that we will pay and the amount of sublease income that we will receive related to the vacant property. As of December 31, 2002, we had $37.5 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities. Our estimates are based, in part, on the most recent negotiations with the landlords of these properties and current market conditions. We expect that approximately $23.6 million of the amount accrued as of December 31, 2002 will be paid within twelve months. Should the actual amounts or the timing of restructuring payments differ from our estimate, we would adjust the restructuring liability through a charge or benefit to restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of operations. If we are not able to successfully modify these leases, the total contractual payout for these properties would be approximately $64.0 million over the next seven years. If we are not successful in subleasing these facilities, the total incremental restructuring charge would be approximately $27.0 million. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Valuation Allowance for Deferred Taxes: We provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A change in our estimate of the future realization of deferred tax assets would result in a material income tax benefit. Capitalization of Internal Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internal use software projects. If the project is an enhancement to previously developed software, we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization. We must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase. Once the project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the internal use software, and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded in during the period. Results of Operations Revenue. Total revenue decreased 11%, or $18.2 million, to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Total revenue was $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For 2002 and 2001, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. For 2000, one customer, Apple Computer, accounted for 12% of our total revenue. For 2002, 13% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the United States. For 2001 20 Table of Contents and 2000, less than 10% of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the United States. Service revenue decreased 5%, or $6.7 million, to $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Service revenue was $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in service revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts, partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer. The increase in service revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to an increase in customers under recurring revenue contracts. Although we have achieved positive net monthly recurring revenue during 2002, we are not able to reasonably predict future service revenue given the uncertainty of competition, customer cancellations and the current macroeconomic environment. License and other revenue decreased 47%, or $5.9 million, to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. License and other revenue was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. License and other revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long term contracts. The decrease in license and other revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a reduction in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers. In contrast, we increased our license and other revenue in 2001 as compared to 2000, principally as a result of the introduction of our EdgeScape license offering in 2001. Service and license revenue from related parties decreased 37%, or $5.6 million, to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Service and license revenue from related parties was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in revenue from related parties between 2002 and 2001 was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue from Sockeye Networks, Inc., or Sockeye, as a result of a reduction in 2001 of Sockeyes minimum monthly revenue commitment and the cancellation in November 2002 of Sockeyes contract with us. The increase in revenue from related parties between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from Sockeye compared to the prior year. As a result of Sockeyes cancellation of its service agreement and the sale of our equity interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK, we do not expect significant revenues from related parties in the future. Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees for housing our servers in third party network data centers. Cost of revenue also includes network operation employee costs, cost of licenses, depreciation on the network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software costs. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we capitalized $174,000 of payroll costs for network operations personnel related to the development of internal use software used to operate and monitor our network. No payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000. Cost of revenue decreased 21%, or $23.0 million, to $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cost of revenue was $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network, lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic. Cost of revenue increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation on network assets and an increase in the amount of traffic delivered over our network. 21 Table of Contents Cost of revenue is comprised of the following (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Bandwidth, co location and storage $ 32.3 $ 55.1 $ 42.0 Network operations personnel 6.2 10.5 10.7 Cost of license 0.5 Depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal use software 46.3 42.7 19.5 Total cost of revenue $ 85.3 $ 108.3 $ 72.2 Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, equity related compensation and related expenses for the design, development, testing and enhancement of our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except certain software development costs eligible for capitalization. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we capitalized $6.0 million, net of impairments, of payroll and payroll related costs related to the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. No payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000. Research and development expenses decreased 51%, or $23.1 million, to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Research and development expenses were $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in salaries as a result of reduced headcount and reduced equity related compensation due to employee terminations in the research and development organization and an increase in capitalization of internal use software development costs. The increase in research and development in 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related costs as a result of increases in headcount and an increase in equity related compensation as a result of the issuance of restricted stock at below market value. These effects are quantified as follows (in millions): (Decrease) Increase in Research and Development Expenses 2002 to 2001 2001 to 2000 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (13.5 ) $ 6.7 Capitalization of internal use software development costs (6.0 ) Other (3.6 ) (0.1 ) Total (decrease) increase $ (23.1 ) $ 6.6 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, equity related compensation, commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 30%, or $28.1 million, to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Sales and marketing expenses were $110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a reduction in payroll, payroll related costs and equity compensation attributable to a reduction in headcount. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily due to a reduction in advertising related expenditures, partially offset by an increase in payroll and payroll related costs 22 Table of Contents attributable to an increase in headcount and an increase in equity compensation as a result of the issuance of restricted stock at below market value. These effects are quantified as follows (in millions): Decrease in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2002 to 2001 2001 to 2000 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (27.5 ) $ 6.3 Advertising and related costs 0.2 (21.1 ) Other (0.8 ) (3.2 ) Total decrease $ (28.1 ) $ (18.0 ) General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and impairment of network equipment and property and equipment used by us internally, salaries, equity related compensation and related expenses for executive, finance, information technology, or IT, human resources and other administrative personnel, fees for professional services, telecommunications costs, the provision for doubtful accounts, rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we capitalized $732,000 of payroll costs for IT personnel related to the development of internal use software. No payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000. General and administrative expenses decreased 20%, or $24.0 million, to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses were $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, reduced payroll related costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001 reflects an improvement in the financial health of our customer base, reflecting our strategy to target permanent enterprise customers. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due to an increase in provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in payroll and payroll related costs, an increase in facility costs, due to an expansion of our operations, and an increase in depreciation. Depreciation increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result of increased purchases of property and equipment by us in 2001. These effects are quantified as follows (in millions): (Decrease) Increase in General and Administrative Expenses 2002 to 2001 2001 to 2000 Bad debt expense $ (8.7 ) $ 2.8 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation (5.1 ) 3.8 Rent and facilities (4.7 ) 5.9 Depreciation 1.0 15.1 Other (6.5 ) 3.8 Total (decrease) increase $ (24.0 ) $ 31.4 Aggregate research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses were $184.5 million, $259.6 million and $239.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As a result of our actions undertaken in 2002 to reduce our overall cost structure, including employee severances and lease terminations, we expect aggregate research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs to decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 35%, or $6.6 million, to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Amortization of other intangible assets was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the discontinuance of assembled workforce amortization in 2002, partially offset by an 23 Table of Contents impairment to intangible assets in 2002. The increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2001 compared to 2000 was attributable to the recognition of a full year of amortization recorded in 2001 due to acquisitions of businesses in 2000. We expect to amortize approximately $2.3 million of intangible assets in 2003. Amortization of Goodwill. We no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately $1.0 million to goodwill. The resulting balance of goodwill was $4.9 million on January 1, 2002. For purposes of performing an impairment test, we determined that we had one reporting unit and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2002 and 2003. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of January 1, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The fair value on January 1, 2002 and 2003 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, as of both dates. Accordingly, we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates. Unless changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required, we will next test goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2004. Amortization of goodwill was $237.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $663.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Amortization expense declined between 2001 and 2000 as a result of an impairment to the balance of goodwill in March 2001. Restructuring Charges. We recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. These charges included $3.6 million for employee severance benefits and $42.2 million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded restructuring charges of $40.5 million. These charges included $5.1 million for severance benefits and $35.4 million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments. We did not have restructuring charges in 2000. Our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Facility leases $ 42.2 $ 35.4 Severance 3.6 5.1 Total $ 45.8 $ 40.5 For the year ended December 31, 2001, management approved an exit plan for excess and vacant facilities under long term non cancelable leases. We recorded a restructuring charge of $34.1 million for the estimated amount of future lease payments and termination fees, less estimated sublease income, for these facilities. We also impaired $1.3 million of leasehold improvements located at these facilities. The impairment was recorded as a non cash restructuring charge. During 2002, we terminated our facility leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at an aggregate cost of $15.9 million, including brokerage and legal fees. As of the termination date, the accrued restructuring liability attributable to these leases was $7.9 million. Accordingly, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $8.0 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued. Also during 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $29.7 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties. In addition, we impaired leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, deposits, deferred rent and other long lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of $4.5 million. 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases (in millions): Restructuring Liabilities Restructuring charge for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 $ 40.5 Cash payments (11.6 ) Non cash items (1.3 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2001 27.6 Restructuring charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 45.8 Cash payments (32.6 ) Non cash items (3.2 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2002 $ 37.6 Current portion of accrued restructuring $ 23.6 Long term portion of accrued restructuring $ 14.0 The amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases has been estimated based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors. In the event that these facility leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2002, we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable. If we are not able to successfully terminate or modify these leases, the total payout for these properties would be approximately $64.0 million over the next seven years, of which $37.5 million is accrued as of December 31, 2002. Impairment of Goodwill. During the first quarter of 2001, we reviewed goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. We considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including our market capitalization compared to book value, the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses. A review of these factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was required for long lived assets of acquired businesses. We grouped all long lived assets for acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these long lived assets. The discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,912.8 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of March 31, 2001. Acquired In Process Research and Development. Acquired in process research and development, which we refer to as IPR&D, consists of a charge for the value of development projects of acquired businesses in 2000 that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of business acquisition. The value of IPR&D of $1.4 million was determined based on each projects stage of development, the time and resources needed for completion, the contribution of core technology and the projected discounted cash flows of completed projects. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes receivable for stock. Interest income decreased 75%, or $9.2 million, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Interest income was $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest income for 2002 as compared with 2001 was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments. Likewise, the decrease in interest income for 2001 as compared with 2000 was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations. Interest expense was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $18.9 million for the year ended 25 Table of Contents December 31, 2001 and $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net interest expense for each of 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 is a result of recognizing a full year of interest on our $300 million debt obligation, which was incurred in June 2000. Other Income. We received $1.0 million in proceeds on a key person life insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of Daniel M. Lewin, Akamais co founder. Loss on Investments. Loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $6.1 million as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of $4.3 million related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a related party, which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April 2002. Loss on investments includes a gain of $400,000 on our sale of our equity interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK to SBBM. In addition, loss on investments in 2002 consists of a loss of $2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value and approximately $149,000 of realized investment gains. For the year ended December 31, 2001, loss on investments includes a loss of $10.2 million for the adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment that was determined to be other than temporary, realized losses of $2.8 million and a related party loss of $2.0 million in an investment accounted for under the equity method. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of capital stock and the issuance in April 1999 of senior subordinated notes, which we repaid in 1999, totaling approximately $124.6 million in net proceeds, an initial public offering of our common stock in October 1999 that provided $217.6 million after underwriters discounts and commissions, and the sale in June 2000 of $300 million in 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes due July 2007, which generated net proceeds of $290.2 million. We have also entered into capital lease agreements to fund the acquisition of property and equipment. As of December 31, 2002, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $125.2 million, of which $13.4 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash. Cash used in operating activities decreased 45%, or $53.5 million, to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cash used in operating activities was $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 41% decrease in net losses before non cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, loss on investments and equity related compensation. Cash used in operating expense in 2001 as compared to 2000 was consistent. We expect that cash used in operating activities will continue to decline in 2003 as a result of actions we undertook in 2002 to reduce operating costs; however, the timing and amount of any lease termination payments and other working capital changes will affect the actual amount of cash used in operating activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cash used in investing activities was $316.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $116.5 million less capital expenditures of $7.2 million, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements for our new corporate office facility and internal infrastructure purchases, and $6.9 million for the capitalization of internal use software development costs, net of impaired projects. Cash provided by investing activities also includes a payment of $6.5 million to CNN to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of InterVu in April 2000. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Cash provided by and used in investing activities in 2001 and 2000 includes $64.5 million and $131.9 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, respectively. We expect capital expenditures, including internal costs for the development of internal use software, to be approximately 5% to 10% of revenue in 2003. We may enter into capital lease arrangements or use our available cash to fund these expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash 26 Table of Contents provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of $2.8 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of $1.6 million. Cash payments on capital lease obligations increased in 2002 due to $3.3 million of new capital leases. We expect to make payments, including interest, of $1.3 million in 2003 and $1.1 million thereafter on these lease obligations. Cash received from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans declined in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to prior years as a result of fewer option exercises in 2002. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 included $290.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $300 million in convertible subordinated notes, due 2007. We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $125.2 million will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Less than 12 36 36 to 60 More than Obligations Amount 12 Months Months Months 60 months 5 1/2% convertible notes $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Real estate operating leases 89.8 $ 15.1 $ 27.3 21.1 $ 26.3 Bandwidth and co location agreements 18.5 12.5 4.8 1.2 Capital leases and purchase obligations 2.4 1.3 1.1 Legal settlements and judgments 4.5 4.5 Vendor equipment purchase obligations 0.5 0.5 Total contractual obligations $ 415.7 $ 33.9 $ 33.2 $ 322.3 $ 26.3 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2002, we had issued $13.4 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to long term facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which $10.2 million are classified as long term and $3.2 million are classified as short term on the consolidated balance sheet. The restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations as provided by the letters of credit. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to whom we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. 27 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective in January 2003. SFAS No. 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting requirements for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Weare assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds several statements, including SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt. The statement also makes several technical corrections to other existing authoritative pronouncements. SFAS No. 145 was effective in May 2002, except for the rescission of SFAS No. 4, which is effective in January 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not have and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability be recognized when it is incurred and should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company ceases using the right conveyed by the contract. For a real estate lease, the fair value of the liability at the cease use date is determined based on the contractual future lease payments, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation 45, or FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a entity issues a guarantee, the entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact that initial measurement provisions of Interpretation 45 will have on our consolidated financial statements. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for this annual report on Form 10 K. Accordingly, we have included a discussion of our guarantees in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue 00 21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 addresses the revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The deliverables in these revenue arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and, if the arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered element, delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable. The relative fair value of each unit should be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement should be allocated among the individual units based on their fair value. The guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. We do not expect that the adoption of EITF 00 21 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based 28 Table of Contents Compensation. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2002 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 will require us to include additional disclosures of equity related compensation in our consolidated financial statements, including this annual report on Form 10 K. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, or FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact that FIN 46 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. We place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations, high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit. We expect to hold our marketable debt securities until maturity and do not expect to realize significant losses on the sale of marketable debt securities prior to maturity. We also hold investments in the equity of several public and private companies. The carrying amount of these investments at December 31, 2002 was approximately $500,000, which we believe approximates their fair value. We have operations in Europe and Japan. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not expect, however, that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Our 5 1/2% convertible notes are subject to changes in market value. As of December 31, 2002, the carrying amount and fair value of these notes were $300.0 million and $133.9 million, respectively. 29 Table of Contents
