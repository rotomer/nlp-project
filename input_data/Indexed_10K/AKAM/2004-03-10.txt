Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We primarily derive revenue from recurring Akamai services sold to customers under contracts of a duration of more than one year, which we refer to as recurring revenue or long term contracts. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum. Having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must eliminate or reduce loss of monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations of terminations, increase our base level of recurring revenue contracts on a quarter over quarter basis and build on that base by adding new customers in the future and increasing the number of features and functions our customers purchase. At the same time, we must ensure that our expenses do not substantially exceed our revenue. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price, quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results elsewhere in the annual report on Form 10 K. Our improved financial results in 2003 as compared to 2002 and 2001 reflect our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2003 2002 2001 Revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenue 38 59 66 Research and development 8 15 28 Sales and marketing 30 45 57 General and administrative 35 68 75 Amortization of other intangible assets 1 8 11 Amortization of goodwill 145 Restructuring (benefits) charges (5 ) 31 25 Impairment of goodwill 1,172 Total cost and operating expenses 107 226 1,579 Loss from operations (7 ) (126 ) (1,479 ) Interest income 1 2 7 Interest expense (12 ) (13 ) (11 ) Other income 1 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (1 ) Gain (loss) on investments, net 1 (4 ) (9 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (18 ) (141 ) (1,491 ) Provision for income taxes 1 Net loss (18 )% (141 )% (1,492 )% Since our inception, we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology, build our worldwide network, sell and market our services and software and support our operations. In recent years, we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and facility lease settlements. We have not yet achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis; however, we have observed the following known trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operation in the future: During each quarter in 2003, the dollar volume of the recurring revenue contracts that we have booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations, terminations and non payment. A continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenue for us. 19 Table of Contents During 2003, one customer, Microsoft Corporation, accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenue. We expect to continue to do business with this customer under a long term contract signed during 2003, and we expect that the revenue from that customer will again be greater than 10% of our total revenue in 2004. We expect revenue derived from companies outside the United States will be between 15% and 20% of our total revenue in 2004. During recent quarters, we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions in the market. These price reductions contributed to reductions to our cost of revenue. We believe bandwidth costs will increase as traffic delivered on our network increases. However, we expect to continue to improve management of our network. If successful, bandwidth cost per unit would slightly decrease. During 2003, depreciation of our long lived assets decreased on a quarterly basis mostly due to these assets becoming fully depreciated. Although we expect that the amortization of internal use software development costs, which we include in cost of revenue, will increase in the future, we expect that total depreciation and amortization expense will continue to decrease in 2004 due to a decline in equipment purchases in 2003 compared to prior years. Additionally, we believe that depreciation will continue to decrease due to a reduction from previous levels as we replace our equipment at lower cost as compared to historical cost. We expect a net decline in equity compensation costs in 2004 as equity awards issued in previous years become fully vested. This reduction is primarily due to equity compensation charges incurred in connection with issuances of restricted common stock as part of our 2001 exchange offer, these restricted shares will become fully vested in May 2004. Any change in the accounting rules related to employee stock awards requiring that we record expense for employee stock awards at fair value would increase our net loss in the future because we have a significant number of employee options outstanding and expect to continue to grant new options in the future. The amount of any increase resulting from the change in the method of accounting for employee stock options is not determinable at this time due to the number of variables under consideration when determining fair value of stock awards. We do not anticipate significant investment losses or gains in the future as our portfolio is currently comprised primarily of high grade debt instruments. While operating expenses decreased in each of the past three years, we do not expect significant decreases to continue. We expect a slight increase in operating costs due to a rise in selling related costs and an increase in headcount. We have restructured our excess leased facilities to align future rent obligations to market rates and to eliminate excess capacity. We do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future; however, we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long term leases if we believe it to be in the best interests of Akamai and our stockholders. In December 2003 and January 2004, we repurchased $99.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. In December 2003 and January 2004, we issued $200.0 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes. In February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in principal amount of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. If the tender offer is fully successful, we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations will not exceed $10.5 million in 2004. We expect to incur additional losses related to the extinguishment of debt in 2004 as a result of the repurchase of $25.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in January 2004 and, if successful, our tender offer to repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes announced in February 2004. 20 Table of Contents Based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events, we expect to generate net income during 2004; however, our future results will be affected by many factors identified below in Factors Affecting Future Operating Results, including our ability to: increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations; maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenue; address future capital expenditure requirements at costs that are within our expectations; and maintain the prices we charge for our services. As a result, there is no assurance that the aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our expected financial objectives. Recent Events In November 2003, we entered into an agreement with Cable and Wireless Internet Services, or CWIS, leading to the dismissal of lawsuits filed by CWIS against us in Boston, San Francisco and London alleging that our services infringe several different CWIS patents. We did not admit liability or make any payments in connection with these dismissals. As part of the settlement, we also agreed to dismiss several lawsuits that we had brought against CWIS. In addition, Akamai and CWIS agreed not to sue each other for a period of five years with respect to the patents and their respective service offerings that had been at issue in these cases. In December 2003, we forgave $247,000 of $778,000 due under a note receivable that had been issued to us by an employee that enabled this employee in 1999, to purchase shares of our common stock. We recorded the forgiveness of $247,000 as equity related compensation. The remaining $531,000 due on the note was paid in full in December 2003. In December 2003, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1% convertible senior notes in exchange for $169.8 million in cash, which reflected a purchase discount of 2.75% to the initial purchaser of the notes and other offering expenses. The notes are due in December 2033; however, we have the right to redeem the notes at par value in December 2010 and the holders of these notes have the right to require us to redeem the notes in December 2010. The 1% convertible senior notes accrue interest at the rate of 1% per year, which is payable semi annually. Under certain circumstances, holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at the price of $15.45 per share. As a result of this transaction, we recorded interest expense, including deferred financing amortization costs, totaling $125,000 in 2003. In January 2004, the initial purchaser of the 1% convertible senior notes exercised its option to purchase an additional $25.0 million in principal amount of the notes for a payment of $24.3 million, net of the initial purchasers discount. In December 2003 and January 2004, in a limited number of individually negotiated transactions, we repurchased an aggregate of $99.0 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate cash payment of $98.9 million, net of interest paid or payable to the holders. In February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. Under the modified Dutch Auction structure of the tender offer, we offered to repurchase up to $101.0 million in principal amount of validly tendered 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes at a purchase price between $1,000 and $1,005 for each $1,000 in principal amount tendered. The tender offer is subject to numerous conditions. The tender offer period is scheduled to expire on March 10, 2004. 21 Table of Contents Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, investments, capitalization of internal use software, intangible assets, income taxes, depreciable lives of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and the specific manner that we apply those principles. We define a critical accounting estimate as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from our services and software when: an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service has been established; the service or software has been delivered to and accepted (when applicable) by the customer; the fee for the service or software is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. At the inception of a long term customer contract for service, we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured. We base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check, financial review, the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, assuming the other criteria are met. If we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received. We also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer. Changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize. When we provide professional services such as custom applications and other services considered essential to the functionality of software for a fixed fee, we recognize revenue from the fees for such services and any related software licenses as we complete the project using the percentage of completion method. We generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours we have incurred to date to the estimate of the total labor hours required to complete the project based on regular discussions with our project managers. This method is used because we consider expended labor hours to be the most reliable, available measure of progress on these projects. Adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known. When the estimate indicates a loss, such loss is provided for 22 Table of Contents in its entirety. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percentage of completion of each contract. Different assumptions could yield materially different results. Other professional services not considered essential to the functionality of the software are limited and primarily include integration fees. We recognize revenue from these professional services monthly, along with the related long term customer contract. When we provide services on a time and materials basis, we recognize revenue as we perform the services based on actual time incurred. When we provide support and maintenance services, we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the related contracts, typically one year. Concurrent Transactions: From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the fair value to us of the vendors product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable. Investments: We periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other than temporary. We consider several factors that may trigger an other than temporary decline in value, such as the length of time the investments value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest. When we conclude that the reduction is other than temporary, the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other than temporary could increase loss on investments. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long Lived Assets: We review our long lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets. Changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially. Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility Leases: When we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we record restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease. 23 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003, we had $5.2 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities. In 2003, we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates, resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of $9.6 million. We expect that approximately $1.6 million of the amount accrued as of December 31, 2003 will be paid within twelve months. In the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space, we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Tax Accruals and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Income Taxes: We have recorded certain tax accruals to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and property tax positions. These potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations. Our estimate of the value of our tax accruals contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and the provision for income taxes. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether, based on such evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods. This assessment requires significant judgment. In addition, we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes, tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws, historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets. We do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained. Capitalization of Internal Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internal use software projects. If the project is an enhancement to previously developed software, we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization. We must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase. Once the project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the internal use software, and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period. Results of Operations Revenue. Total revenue increased 11%, or $16.3 million, to $161.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Total revenue decreased 11%, or $18.2 million, to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total revenue for 2003 as compared to 24 Table of Contents 2002 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of $28.7 million, partially offset by reductions in software and software related revenue of $2.8 million and related party revenue of $9.7 million. The increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue, along with usage based customer revenue due to an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year. Microsoft Corporation was the largest contributor to the increase in revenue attributable to usage that was not pre committed by our customers. Service revenue also increased due to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts. As of December 31, 2003, we had 1,126 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 955 as of December 31, 2002, and 1,078 as of December 31, 2001. Revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to a reduction in service revenue of $6.7 million attributable to a decrease in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts, a reduction in software and software related revenue of $5.9 million due to a decrease in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers, as well as a decrease in related party revenue primarily due to the reduction in the monthly commitment of Sockeye Networks, Inc., or Sockeye. For 2003 and 2002, 16% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the United States, of which 13% and 10%, respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. No single country accounted for 10% or more of revenue derived outside of the United States. For 2001, less than 10% of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the United States. Resellers accounted for 25% of revenue in 2003, 24% in 2002 and 20% in 2001. For 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 15% of revenue. For 2002 and 2001, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. In September 2003, we executed an amendment to our content delivery services customer agreement with Microsoft Corporation. The amended agreement has a two year term with a minimum usage commitment of $1.3 million. The parties have agreed that, in August 2004, they will negotiate in good faith appropriate changes, if any, to the pricing levels then in effect. If Akamai and Microsoft Corporation are unable to reach agreement on requested pricing changes, the pricing will not change; however, Microsoft Corporation will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50% for the second year of the term, and the services shall thereafter be provided on a month to month basis subject to termination by either party on ten days notice. Service revenue, which consists of revenues from our content and application delivery services, increased 22%, or $28.7 million, to $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Service revenue was $135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in service revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue, an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year and an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts. The decrease in service revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts, partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer. We expect service revenue to continue to increase in 2004 as companies continue to choose to outsource some of their IT spending. Software and software related revenue decreased 43%, or $2.8 million, to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Software and software related revenue was $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Software and software related revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long term contracts. The continual decrease in software and software related revenue for the periods presented reflects a reduction in the amount of customized software projects and other technology licensed to customers and a decrease in the number of perpetual licenses executed as we focus on our core services business. Service and software revenue from related parties decreased 99%, or $9.7 million, to $137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Service and software revenue from related parties was $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The reduction in revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 from related parties was primarily attributable to revenue in 2002 from Sockeye, Akamai Technologies Japan KK, or Akamai Japan, and SOFTBANK, or SBBM, a co investor in Akamai Japan, with no associated revenue in 2003. Related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue from 25 Table of Contents Akamai Australia, a joint venture with ES Group Ventures Pty Ltd, relating to resale commitments. In December 2002 and June 2003, the joint ventures of Akamai Japan and Akamai Australia, respectively, were terminated. In 2003, Akamai formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Japan. The decrease in revenue from related parties in 2002 as compared to 2001 was a result of the reduction in Sockeyes minimum monthly revenue commitment in 2001 and the cancellation in November 2002 of Sockeyes contract with us. We expect no revenue from related parties during 2004. Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment. Cost of revenue also includes payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for network operations personnel, cost of licenses, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software costs. Cost of revenue decreased 28%, or $24.2 million, to $61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of revenue decreased 21%, or $23.0 million, to $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Traffic delivered over our network increased during 2003 compared to 2002. Despite this increase in traffic, cost of revenue decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to lower bandwidth costs, which we achieved by entering into new, competitively priced network contracts, renegotiating existing network contracts to achieve more favorable pricing and continued improved management of our network traffic. During 2003, depreciation of network equipment continued to decrease as our network assets became fully depreciated. Payroll and payroll related costs, including equity compensation, also decreased in 2003 due to a reduction in headcount. Cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 by $23.0 million primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network, lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic. Cost of revenue during 2003 and 2002 also included credits received of approximately $3.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, as a result of entering into new, competitively priced network contracts and renegotiation of existing network contracts. We expect that credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to lower our network costs; however, the timing and amount of these credits, if any, will vary. Cost of revenue is comprised of the following (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Bandwidth, co location and storage $ 24.5 $ 32.3 $ 55.1 Network operations personnel payroll and related costs, including equity compensation 2.9 6.2 10.5 Cost of software license 0.4 0.5 Depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal use software 33.3 46.3 42.7 Total cost of revenue $ 61.1 $ 85.3 $ 108.3 We believe cost of revenue will slightly increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 because we expect to deliver more traffic on our network and that amortization of internal use software development costs will increase. We anticipate that these increases will be offset by a decline in depreciation of our network equipment. In addition, higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network would be mitigated by lower bandwidth costs per unit, if we are successful at continuing to improve our management of our network. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for research and development personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except certain software development costs required to be capitalized. During the year ended December 31, 26 Table of Contents 2003 and 2002, we capitalized $7.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively, net of impairments, of payroll and payroll related costs related to the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. We did not capitalize any payroll costs in 2001. These capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years. Research and development expenses decreased 40%, or $8.8 million, to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Research and development expenses decreased 51%, or $23.1 million, to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002, as well as 2002 as compared to 2001, was primarily due to an increase in capitalization of internal use software costs and a decrease in payroll and related costs, including equity related compensation, as a result of workforce reductions in 2002. The decreases in research and development expenses over these years is quantified as follows (in millions): Decrease in Research and Development Expenses 2003 to 2002 2002 to 2001 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (7.4 ) $ (13.5 ) Capitalization of internal use software development costs (1.1 ) (6.0 ) Other (0.3 ) (3.6 ) Total decrease $ (8.8 ) $ (23.1 ) We believe that research and development expenses will increase slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003, as we continue to make development investments. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs, equity related compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 27%, or $17.2 million, to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 30%, or $28.1 million, to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002, as well as 2002 as compared to 2001, was primarily due to a reduction in payroll and payroll related costs, including decreases in equity related compensation attributable to reductions in headcount in 2002. Sales and marketing during 2003 also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs associated with an agreement between CNN News Group and Akamai, which expired in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decreases in sales and marketing expenses over these years is quantified as follows (in millions): (Decrease) Increase in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2003 to 2002 2002 to 2001 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (10.9 ) $ (27.5 ) Advertising and related costs (7.2 ) 0.2 Other 0.9 (0.8 ) Total net decrease $ (17.2 ) $ (28.1 ) We believe sales and marketing expenses will increase modestly in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to an expected increase in commissions and marketing costs. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally, payroll and related costs, equity related compensation and related expenses for executive, finance, business applications, network management, human resources and 27 Table of Contents other administrative personnel, fees for professional services, the provision for doubtful accounts and rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties. General and administrative expenses decreased 42%, or $40.9 million, to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses decreased 20%, or $24.0 million, to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to reduced payroll and related costs, including equity related compensation, and reduced rent expense as a result of restructurings. In 2003, general and administrative expenses also decreased due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, reduced payroll and related costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings. The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001 reflected an improvement in the financial health of our customer base which had begun to include more customers that do not rely solely on Internet based commerce for their revenues. The decrease in general and administrative over these years is quantified as follows (in millions): (Decrease) Increase in General and Administrative Expenses 2003 to 2002 2002 to 2001 Bad debt expense $ 1.5 $ (8.7 ) Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation (17.7 ) (5.1 ) Rent and facilities (6.2 ) (4.7 ) Depreciation (14.5 ) 1.0 Other (4.0 ) (6.5 ) Total net decrease $ (40.9 ) $ (24.0 ) We do not expect significant further decreases in general and administrative expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003, rather we believe that these expenses will remain constant in 2004. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 81%, or $9.7 million, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 35%, or $6.6 million, to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of 2003; therefore, there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the remainder of 2003. The decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the discontinuation of assembled workforce amortization in 2002, partially offset by an impairment to intangible assets in 2002. We expect to amortize approximately $48,000 of intangible assets in 2004 and in each year thereafter through 2008, during which they will become fully amortized. Amortization of Goodwill. We no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately $1.0 million to goodwill. The resulting balance of goodwill was $4.9 million on January 1, 2002. For purposes of performing an impairment test, we determined that we had one reporting unit, and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of January 1, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value on January 1, 2004, 2003 and 2002 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, as of these dates. Accordingly, we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates. Unless changes in events or 28 Table of Contents circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required, we will next test goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2005. Amortization of goodwill was $237.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Restructuring Charges. We recorded net restructuring benefits of $8.5 million as a result of amendments to and terminations of facility leases during the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million, which represents $3.6 million for employee severance benefits and $42.2 million attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded restructuring charges of $40.5 million, which represents $5.1 million for employee severance benefits and $35.4 million attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments. Our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Facility leases $ (8.5 ) $ 42.2 $ 35.4 Severance 3.6 5.1 Total $ (8.5 ) $ 45.8 $ 40.5 During 2002, in connection with the termination of our facility leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we recorded restructuring charges of $8.0 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued. Also during 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $29.7 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties. In addition, we impaired leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, deposits, deferred rent and other long lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of $4.5 million. During 2003, we amended or terminated three long term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of $16.1 million in cash and restricted cash. As a result of these lease amendments and terminations, we reversed $9.6 million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities and recorded $1.1 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility in Europe. These three transactions are as follows: In April 2003, we amended our lease obligation for a substantially vacant facility in Santa Clara, California. Under the terms of the amendment, we made a payment of $9.4 million. The total payment also included the release of $5.7 million in restricted cash. As a result of this amended lease agreement, we reversed $9.2 million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities. We continued to pay rent at the previously contracted rate through the end of 2003. Beginning in January 2004, rent will be reduced to a lower rate substantially aligned with market rates in the area. The amended lease is scheduled to terminate in August 2007. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining restructuring liability related to this facility was $5.0 million. As we make the remaining contractual rent payments allocable to the vacated space, this liability will be reduced. We are actively seeking a subtenant for this space. We have estimated no sublease income for this facility due to the market conditions in the area. In May 2003, we terminated our lease for a facility located in the United Kingdom for a fee of approximately $700,000. In connection with this lease termination, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.1 million for costs related to the termination fee and the write off of long lived assets and long term deposits, of which $144,000 represents a non cash restructuring charge for impairments of leasehold improvements and other long lived assets. We have relocated our operations in the United Kingdom to a smaller facility. In June 2003, we terminated our long term lease for our San Mateo, California facility for a payment of $6.0 million and entered into a new lease for 60% less space in this facility. As a result of this terminated lease, we reversed $400,000 of previously recorded restructuring liabilities. Of the $6.0 million payment, $1.1 million was recorded as a prepayment for the remaining utilized space and is being amortized over the remaining term of the original lease. We have previously accrued a restructuring liability for the vacant portion of the original lease. The new lease is scheduled to expire in May 2008. 29 Table of Contents Rent payments under the new lease are lower than under the original lease, and are more in line with current market rates. The following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases (in millions): Restructuring Liabilities Ending balance, December 31, 2001 $ 27.6 Restructuring charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 45.8 Cash payments (32.6 ) Non cash items (3.2 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2002 37.6 Restructuring benefits net, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 (includes the reversal of $9.6 million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities) (8.5 ) Cash payments (23.8 ) Non cash items (0.1 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2003 $ 5.2 Current portion of accrued restructuring $ 1.6 Long term portion of accrued restructuring $ 3.6 We do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future; however, we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long term leases if we believe it to be in the best interests of Akamai and our stockholders. We have estimated the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors. Impairment of Goodwill. During the first quarter of 2001, we reviewed goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. We considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including our market capitalization compared to book value, the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses. A review of these factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was required for long lived assets of acquired businesses. We grouped all long lived assets for acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these long lived assets. The discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,912.8 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of March 31, 2001. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes receivable for stock. Interest income decreased 57%, or $1.7 million, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest income decreased 75%, or $9.2 million, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income for each of 2003 and 2002 as compared with prior periods was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments. We expect our interest income in 2004 to be consistent with 2003 as our invested cash balance should remain constant or slightly increase, assuming consummation of the tender offer to repurchase $101.0 million of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in March 2004, with no expected change in the interest rates we expect to earn. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations. Interest expense was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Interest expense remained 30 Table of Contents relatively constant throughout the periods presented. In December 2003 and January 2004, we repurchased $99.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. In February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in principal amount of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. In December 2003 and January 2004, we issued $200.0 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes. If the tender offer is fully successful, we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations will not exceed $10.5 million in 2004. Other Income. We received $1.0 million in proceeds on a key person life insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of Daniel M. Lewin, Akamais co founder. Gain (loss) on Investments, net. During 2003, we recorded a net gain on investments of $1.6 million, of which $1.7 million related to the sale of equity investments in publicly traded companies, offset by losses of $55,000 on investments in a privately held companies and sale of marketable securities. Loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of $4.3 million related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a related party, which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April 2002. Loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of $400,000 on our sale of our equity interest in Akamai Japan to SBBM. In addition, loss on investments in 2002 consists of a loss of $2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value, partially offset by approximately $149,000 of realized investment gains. For the year ended December 31, 2001, loss on investments includes a loss of $10.2 million for the adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment that was determined to be other than temporary, realized losses of $2.8 million and a related party loss of $2.0 million in an investment accounted for under the equity method. We do not expect significant gain or losses on investments, as our portfolio is comprised primarily of high grade debt instruments. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million as a result of costs incurred in connection with our repurchase of $74.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes during the year. This loss represents the reduction of $1.2 million of deferred financing costs associated with repurchases of notes and $890,000 of advisory services incurred related to the repurchases. We expect to incur additional losses on early extinguishment of debt in connection with additional repurchases of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated debt in 2004. See Recent Events above. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions: private sales of capital stock; the issuance in April 1999 of senior subordinated notes, which we repaid in 1999, totaling approximately $124.6 million in net proceeds; an initial public offering of our common stock in October 1999 that provided $217.6 million after underwriters discounts and commissions; the sale in June 2000 of $300 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, which generated net proceeds of $290.2 million; the sale in December 2003 of $175 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2033, which generated net proceeds of $169.8 million; and the sale in January 2004 of an additional $25 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes as a result of the purchasers exercise of its option to purchase additional notes, resulting in net proceeds of $24.3 million. As of December 31, 2003, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $208.4 million, of which $9.6 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. See Letters of Credit and Restricted Cash below. 31 Table of Contents Cash used in operating activities decreased 73%, or $47.8 million, to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash used in operating activities decreased 45%, or $53.5 million, to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $108.0 million, or 141%, in net losses before non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, loss on investments, equity related compensation and loss on early extinguishment of debt. Cash used in operating expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 decreased primarily due to a decrease of approximately $54,000, or 41%, in net losses before non cash expenses. Cash used in investing activities was $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash provided by investing activities was $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in our net investment in marketable securities year over year. Cash used in investing activities for 2003 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $27.7 million and capital expenditures, including capitalization of internal use software development costs of $8.9 million. Cash provided by investing activities for 2002 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $116.5 million less capital expenditures of $14.2 million, including capitalization of internal use software development costs. Cash provided by investing activities during 2002 also includes a payment of $6.5 million to CNN News Group to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of InterVu, Inc., or InterVu, in April 2000. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K for further discussion. We expect total capital expenditures, a component of cash used in investing activities, will not exceed 10% of revenue in 2004. Cash provided by financing activities was $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds received from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes, net of financing costs, of $169.8 million, issuances of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plans of $8.6 million, settlement of notes receivable for stock of $2.3 million, offset by payments for the repurchase of $74.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase $5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in early 2004, and payments on our capital leases of $1.4 million. We satisfied the $5.0 million commitment to repurchase notes in January 2004. Cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of $2.8 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of $1.6 million. Cash received from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans increased in 2003 as compared to prior years as a result of more option exercises in 2003. Assuming consummation of our announced tender offer for up to $101.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, along with the issuance of an additional $25.0 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes and the repurchase of $25.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, we expect our cash used for financing activities in 2004 to increase as compared to 2003. We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $208.4 million will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and outstanding debt securities, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results. 32 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Less than 12 to 36 36 to 60 More than Obligations Total 12 Months Months Months 60 Months 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes $ 226.0 $ 15.0 $ 211.0 1% convertible senior notes 175.0 $ 175.0 Interest on convertible notes outstanding assuming no early redemption 93.9 15.5 $ 25.6 9.0 43.8 Real estate operating leases 25.7 6.1 10.4 7.9 1.3 Bandwidth and co location agreements 11.7 10.1 1.6 Capital leases and purchase obligations 0.8 0.8 Vendor equipment purchase obligations 0.5 0.5 Open vendor purchase orders 2.5 2.5 Advisory services 0.6 0.6 Total contractual obligations $ 536.7 $ 51.1 $ 37.6 $ 227.9 $ 220.1 Letters of Credit and Restricted Cash As of December 31, 2003, we had issued $4.6 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to long term facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which $3.9 million are classified as long term and $726,000 are classified as short term on our consolidated balance sheet. The restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations as provided by the letters of credit. As of December 31, 2003, we had $5.0 million classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. This amount reflects our commitment at December 31, 2003 to repurchase $5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2003, the related debt is included in our current liabilities as current portion of 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in our consolidated balance sheet. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We have not accrued a liability for any guarantee identified because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation under the guarantees is remote. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue 00 21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 addresses revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The deliverables in these revenue arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and, if the 33 Table of Contents arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered element, delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable. The relative fair value of each unit should be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement should be allocated among the individual units based on their fair value. The guidance on this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, or FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We currently do not hold any variable interest entities and therefore FIN 46 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, 46 6, Effective Date of FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This FSP deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. FSP 46 6 had no effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46R, or FIN 46R, A Revision to FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of FIN 46R. We currently do not hold any variable interest entities and therefore FIN 46R is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends SFAS No. 133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis. This statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 149 on July 1, 2003 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of debt that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. SFAS No. 150 became effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise became effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of the SFAS No. 150 did not impact our consolidated financial statements. In August 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 03 05, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97 2 to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More Than Incidental Software. EITF 03 05 addresses the applicability of SOP 97 2 to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software. In an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole, software and software related elements are included within the scope of SOP 97 2. Software related elements include software products and services, as well as any non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality. The adoption of EITF 03 05 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 104 rescinds 34 Table of Contents accounting guidance on SAB No. 101 related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments. We place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations, high quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit. We may incur realized losses as a result of early redemptions of our debt securities. Our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes and 1% convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value. Under certain conditions, the holders of our 1% convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after December 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying amount and fair value of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes were $226.0 million and $187.6 million, respectively. In February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to $101.0 million of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. The carrying amount and fair value of the 1% convertible senior notes were both $175.0 million as of December 31, 2003. We have operations in Europe and Asia. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. 35 Table of Contents
