Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 38, in the table regarding premiums earned by brand. That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. Risk Management, Underwriting and Pricing Strategic Risk Management. Strategic Risk Management (SRM) is a tier based pricing, underwriting and marketing program. Tier based pricing and underwriting produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated solely by the pre SRM standard/non standard model that we used. Our tier based pricing and underwriting is designed to enhance Allstates competitive position with respect to "high lifetime value" market segments while maintaining or improving profitability. When implementing SRM, we have introduced the use of insurance scoring based on credit history, where legally permissible, to increase the accuracy of our risk evaluation. SRM uses insurance scoring in addition to, and not instead of, other risk evaluation factors. For automobile insurance, these other factors include, to the extent legally permissible, loss history, driving record, car year and make, and marital status. For property insurance, these other factors include, to the extent legally permissible, loss history, condition of the property, and proximity to a fire department. Since we began using SRM several years ago, our use of it has been focused primarily on acquiring and retaining new business. We intend to continue to implement and refine SRM in accordance with state regulatory processes. We have been separating our private passenger auto insurance into standard and non standard categories for pricing and or underwriting purposes. Generally, standard customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard customers. But our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into these categories. In some states, we have implemented SRM and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what might be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan, which might be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks. As the implementation of SRM continues, the distinctions between standard and non standard may become less important in certain states, depending upon how SRM is implemented. Lifetime Value. We regard "lifetime value" as the discounted value of a customers future cash flow stream. To compute a customers lifetime value score, we analyze characteristics about the 2 customer (for example, age, marital status and driving record) and the product the customer has purchased (for example, coverages, limits, and descriptors of the asset insured) on the basis of historic data patterns and trends. Because future loss and retention patterns of customers vary significantly, the distribution of lifetime values for a large group of customers will vary from very negative to very positive. "High lifetime value" generally refers to customers who have above average lifetime values. Involuntary. The Allstate Protection segment participates in the "involuntary" or "shared" private passenger auto insurance business. This business provides auto insurance to individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain it due to their driving records or other factors. Like all auto insurers, Allstate is required to write or share the cost of this business in order to maintain its licenses to do business in many states. Retention. As is true for the industry in general, costs attributable to our personal property and casualty products are generally higher during the first year an insurance policy is in effect than in subsequent years. Certain costs of issuing an insurance policy, such as processing and inspection expenses generally occur only in the first year the policy is in force. Policies that remain in force generally become more profitable over time. Accordingly, customer retention is an important factor in the segments profitability and a key element of our strategy in this business. Claims In the Allstate Protection segment we seek to efficiently pay fair and correct amounts on all claims on a timely basis. As part of this effort, we employ strategies focused on specific segments of the claim adjustment process and we use the expertise and services provided by vendors where appropriate. We continue to research, develop and implement strategies to improve the cost effectiveness of our claim processes, to leverage our scale and buying power, to leverage our use of technology, to reduce operational costs, to improve process management and to enhance service for our customers. Allstates efficient management of the claims process helps maintain competitive and profitable insurance pricing. Distribution The Allstate Protection segment sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance primarily through agencies. The Allstate brand products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and, to a lesser extent, through independent agencies in areas not served by exclusive agencies. However, in those states where we have implemented The Good Hands&reg; Network, consumers can also purchase certain Allstate personal insurance products and obtain service through our Customer Information Centers and, in many of those states, over the Internet. The Good Hands Network a multi access platform that integrates the local Allstate exclusive agencies, the Internet and our Customer Information Centers is available in 30 states and the District of Columbia to over 85% of the United States population. In some states where we have implemented The Good Hands Network, but where customers cannot use the Internet to purchase our products, they can use it to get information and service on a limited basis. Our Ivantage business sells EncompassSM and Deerbrook&reg; brand products through independent agencies. The Encompass brand includes standard private passenger auto and homeowners insurance products while the Deerbrook brand includes non standard private passenger auto insurance. Our broad based network of approximately 11,200 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations in the U.S. produced approximately 79% of the Allstate Protection segments written premiums in 2003. The rest was generated primarily by approximately 14,200 independent agencies. We are among the four largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information published 3 by A.M. Best and our analysis of publicly available GAAP financial statements of our principal competitors in the independent agency channel. Geographic Markets The principal geographic markets for our personal property and casualty products are in the United States. Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. The following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the segment for the year ended December 31, 2003. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment. Texas 11.5 % California 10.7 % New York 10.5 % Florida 9.6 % Our underwriting strategy for homeowners insurance is to target customers whose risk of loss provides Allstate with the best opportunity for profitable growth. This includes managing exposure on policies in geographic areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels. Competition The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2002 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according to A. M. Best. Private Passenger Auto Insurance Homeowners Insurance Insurer Market Share Insurer Market Share State Farm 19.6 % State Farm 22.5 % Allstate* 11.3 % Allstate* 12.7 % Progressive 5.7 % Farmers 8.2 % Farmers 5.4 % Nationwide 4.6 % Geico 4.7 % USAA 3.6 % Nationwide 4.6 % Travelers 3.4 % *Allstates market shares, above, are the sum of the market shares reported by A.M. Best for Allstate Insurance Group and for the personal lines insurance business of CNA Insurance Companies, which Allstate acquired in 1999. In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our distribution system, price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use SRM to divide the market into segments, appropriately price risks and cross sell its products within its customer base. The following chart shows the approximate amount of personal property and casualty statutory premiums generated in three primary distribution channels in the U.S. in 2002: Exclusive agencies (employee and independent contractors) $ 124.0 billion Independent agencies $ 64.2 billion Direct response (call centers and Internet) $ 22.4 billion 4 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Products The Allstate Financial products are listed below. We continue to develop new versions of these products to satisfy evolving consumer needs. Insurance Term life Universal life Single premium life Variable life Variable universal life Whole life Long term care Accidental death Hospital indemnity Disability income Cancer Accident Critical illness Dental Heart/stroke Limited benefit medical Annuities Other Fixed annuities (Immediate and deferred, including indexed) Variable annuities Structured settlement annuities Funding agreements Certificates of deposit Money market accounts Savings accounts Checking accounts First mortgage loans During 2003, we discontinued sales of traditional guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and synthetic GICs. Information regarding the last three years revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Financial segment is contained in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 18 also includes information regarding the last three years identifiable assets attributable to the Allstate Financial segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. Information regarding premiums and contract charges for Allstate Financial segment products for the last three years is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 60, in the table that summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. Risk Management, Underwriting and Pricing For individual life insurance policies, we use detailed and uniform underwriting policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of each applicant. In some cases we require medical examinations and in some cases we may order attending physicians statements and consumer investigative reports. For supplemental accident and health insurance products, we use a more simplified underwriting approach. Structured settlement annuities and immediate annuities are underwritten using recent mortality experience and an assumption of continued improvement in annuitant longevity. Some of our life insurance policies allow us to adjust charges and credits, generally, to reflect changes from expected mortality and expense experience or higher or lower investment returns. However, we are subject to contractual maximum charges and minimum crediting rates and state regulatory limits on increasing charges after a policy is issued. 5 We price our personal life insurance, retirement and investment products at issuance to achieve a target return on required capital based on assumptions regarding mortality, expenses, investment return, persistency, required reserves and capital. Our assumptions are based on regular reviews of our experience in this business. Periodically, we revise in force products through non guaranteed charges or credits to reflect changes in experience and to preserve the margins originally priced into the product. For funding agreements, our risk management strategy is based on: Using sophisticated systems and processes to project expected cash flows for assets and liabilities and to measure the sensitivity of asset and liability cash flows to interest rate changes. Managing interest rate exposure to control the "duration match" of assets and liabilities. In other words, closely matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes when feasible, often by using derivative financial instruments. Primarily writing contracts with predictable maturity structures and without credit event triggers, cross default acceleration clauses or premature surrender or redemption provisions. Monitoring withdrawal activity to detect deviations from expected cash flows. Establishing multi disciplinary working groups of professionals with expertise in investment, sales, financial and pricing management to manage risk. Distribution The Allstate Financial segment distributes its products through various distribution channels, as described below. This multi channel distribution strategy results in a broad distribution network and increases operating flexibility while allowing us to focus our marketing efforts. Independent Agents. Through master brokerage agencies, we use independent agents to distribute term life insurance, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, fixed annuities (immediate and deferred, including indexed), variable annuities and long term care insurance. Allstate Exclusive Agencies. Through Allstate agencies, we use exclusive agents and exclusive financial specialists to increase sales of our personal life insurance, retirement and investment products. The products distributed through this channel include term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, deferred fixed annuities, variable annuities, long term care insurance, disability income insurance, cancer insurance, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, first mortgage loans and non proprietary mutual funds. Broker Dealers. Through broker dealers across the country, we target consumers who want assistance in investing for retirement. The products that we distribute through broker dealers include fixed annuities (deferred, including indexed), variable annuities and single premium variable life insurance. We have established distribution arrangements with most national broker dealers and regional firms and with many independent broker dealers. Financial Institutions. We also use financial institutions across the country to target consumers who want assistance in investing for retirement. The products that we distribute through financial institutions include fixed annuities (deferred, including indexed), variable annuities, single premium fixed life insurance and single premium variable life insurance. We have established distribution arrangements with a growing number of leading financial institutions. Direct Marketing. In 2003, we continued to use direct marketing techniques such as telemarketing and direct mail to distribute primarily term life insurance, accidental death insurance and hospital indemnity products. However, we intend to dispose of this distribution channel in 2004. 6  Workplace Marketing. Through workplace marketing, we target employees primarily of small and medium size firms. We examine the benefit programs offered by these firms and recommend personal insurance products that complement and supplement their existing plans. Then we offer the recommended products to the employees on a voluntary participation basis, with premiums paid through payroll deductions. The insurance products that we sell through workplace marketing include universal life, term life, disability income, cancer, accident, critical illness, heart/stroke, hospital indemnity, limited benefit medical and dental insurance. Institutional Investors Funding Agreements. Primarily, we sell funding agreements directly to variable interest entities that issue medium term notes through investment banks to investors seeking high quality, fixed income investments. However, we also sell funding agreements, directly or through specialized brokers, to short term institutional money managers seeking high quality investments with reasonable liquidity. Approximately 84% of our funding agreement sales are derived from transactions in which a variable interest entity purchases a funding agreement with terms similar to those of notes issued by the variable interest entity to institutional investors. The level of funding agreement sales to variable interest entities is dependent on conditions in the capital markets. As a result, sales of funding agreements can vary widely from one reporting period to another. Structured Settlement Annuities. We have relationships with several structured settlement brokers and brokerage firms across the country. In addition, a significant number of the structured settlement annuities that we sold in 2003 originated with cases referred from claims activity in our Allstate Protection segment. The following table lists the Allstate Financial segments major distribution channels with the associated primary products and targeted customers. Distribution Channel Primary Products Targeted Customers Independent agents Term life insurance Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Fixed annuities (Immediate and deferred, including indexed) Variable annuities Long term care insurance Affluent and middle income consumers with retirement and family financial protection needs Allstate Exclusive Agencies Term life insurance Whole life insurance Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Fixed annuities (Deferred) Variable annuities Long term care insurance Disability income insurance Cancer insurance Certificates of deposit Money market accounts Savings accounts Checking accounts First mortgage loans Nonproprietary mutual funds Moderate and middle income consumers with retirement and family financial protection needs 7 Broker dealers Fixed annuities (Deferred, including indexed) Variable annuities Single premium variable life insurance Affluent and middle income consumers with retirement needs Financial institutions Fixed annuities (Deferred, including indexed) Variable annuities Single premium fixed life insurance Single premium variable life insurance Middle income consumers with retirement needs Direct marketing Term life insurance Accidental death insurance Hospital indemnity Moderate income consumers with family financial protection needs Workplace marketing Universal life insurance Term life insurance Disability income insurance Cancer insurance Accident insurance Critical illness Heart/stroke insurance Hospital indemnity Limited benefit medical insurance Dental insurance Moderate and middle income consumers with family financial protection needs employed primarily by small and medium size firms Direct marketing and specialized brokers to institutional investors Funding agreements Institutional investors Structured settlement annuity brokers Structured settlement annuities Typically used to fund or annuitize large claims or litigation settlements Geographic Markets We sell our personal life insurance, retirement, investment, and supplemental accident and health products throughout the United States. Through subsidiary insurance companies, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We sell funding agreements in the United States and in the Cayman Islands. However, in the Cayman Islands, our distribution is generally limited to selling funding agreements to support medium term note programs. The following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended December 31, 2003, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. Approximately 93.81% of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations generated in Delaware represent deposits received in connection with funding agreements sold to a variable interest 8 entity domiciled in Delaware. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations. Delaware 16.6 % California 9.5 % New York 6.3 % Florida 6.2 % Texas 5.1 % Pennsylvania 5.1 % Competition With regard to our personal life insurance, retirement, investment and supplemental accident and health insurance products, we compete principally on the basis of the scope of our distribution systems, the breadth of our product offerings, the recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our product features and prices, and the level of customer service that we provide. In addition, with respect to variable life and variable annuity products, we compete on the basis of the variety of providers and choices of funds for our separate accounts and the management and performance of those funds within our separate accounts. The market for these products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2002, there were approximately 780 groups of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more products similar to the Allstate Financial segments products. Based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, as of December 31, 2002, the Allstate Financial segment ranked 13th based on ordinary life insurance in force and 19th based on statutory admitted assets. In some states, we compete with banks and savings and loan associations in the sale of life insurance products. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure is growing due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry. OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non insurance operations. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three years. Our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other business in run off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 9 RESERVE FOR PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Reconciliation of Claims Reserves The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. GROSS Year Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 16,690 $ 16,500 $ 16,859 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 17,183 17,237 17,495 Change in provision attributable to prior years 704 765 508 Total claims and claims expense 17,887 18,002 18,003 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 10,240 10,690 11,386 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,623 7,122 6,976 Total payments 16,863 17,812 18,362 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table $ 17,714 $ 16,690 $ 16,500 10 NET Year Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 15,018 $ 14,833 $ 15,225 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 17,031 16,972 17,190 Change in provision attributable to prior years 401 685 342 Total claims and claims expense 17,432 17,657 17,532 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 10,195 10,598 11,176 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,275 6,874 6,748 Total payments 16,470 17,472 17,924 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table(1) $ 15,980 $ 15,018 $ 14,833 (1)Reserves for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $1.73 billion, $1.67 billion and $1.67 billion at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The year end 2003 gross reserves of $17.71 billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $2.69 billion more than the net reserve balance of $15.02 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $1.73 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting and a liability for $0.10 billion that represents a deposit on assumed reinsurance from the acquisition of CNAs personal lines business, now called Encompass. Additional differences are caused by the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $0.81 billion, which are not included in the combined United States statutory statement. As the tables above illustrate, Allstates net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2002 increased in 2003 by $401 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of $704 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions on gross reserve reestimates. Loss Reserve Reestimates The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstates expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. 11  Loss Reserve Reestimates December 31, ($ millions) 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gross Reserves for Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 15,209 $ 16,414 $ 17,326 $ 17,382 $ 17,403 $ 16,881 $ 17,814 $ 16,859 $ 16,500 $ 16,690 $ 17,714 Deduct: Reinsurance Recoverable 1,338 1,298 1,490 1,784 1,630 1,458 1,653 1,634 1,667 1,672 1,734 Reserve For Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 13,871 $ 15,116 $ 15,836 $ 15,598 $ 15,773 $ 15,423 $ 16,161 $ 15,225 $ 14,833 $ 15,018 $ 15,980 Paid (cumulative) as of: One year later 4,472 4,748 5,787 5,013 5,488 5,615 5,973 6,748 6,874 6,275 Two years later 6,519 7,749 8,232 7,952 8,361 8,638 9,055 10,066 9,931 Three years later 8,273 9,247 10,083 9,773 10,336 10,588 11,118 11,889 Four years later 9,140 10,400 11,170 11,040 11,587 11,950 12,197 Five years later 9,849 11,070 12,034 11,847 12,512 12,608 Six years later 10,251 11,702 12,590 12,528 12,967 Seven years later 10,725 12,128 13,134 12,881 Eight years later 10,982 12,599 13,429 Nine years later 11,339 12,863 Ten years later 11,553 Reserve Reestimated as of: End of year 13,871 15,116 15,836 15,598 15,773 15,423 16,161 15,225 14,833 15,018 15,980 One year later 13,159 14,691 15,500 14,921 15,073 14,836 15,439 15,567 15,518 15,419 Two years later 12,890 14,295 14,917 14,450 14,548 14,371 15,330 15,900 16,175 Three years later 12,832 13,928 14,700 14,156 14,183 14,296 15,583 16,625 Four years later 12,617 13,835 14,613 13,894 14,168 14,530 16,317 Five years later 12,585 13,915 14,455 13,888 14,406 15,260 Six years later 12,730 13,882 14,452 14,140 15,109 Seven years later 12,733 13,877 14,703 14,824 Eight years later 12,617 14,124 15,370 Nine years later 12,839 14,784 Ten years later 13,461 Initial reserve in excess of (less than) reestimated reserve: Amount of reestimate $ 410 $ 332 $ 466 $ 774 $ 664 $ 163 $ (156 ) $ (1,400 ) $ (1,342 ) $ (401 ) Percent 3.0 % 2.2 % 2.9 % 5.0 % 4.2 % 1.1 % 1.0 % 9.2 % 9.0 % 2.7 % Gross Reestimated Liability Latest $ 15,803 $ 16,995 $ 17,570 $ 17,325 $ 17,394 $ 17,405 $ 18,515 $ 18,752 $ 18,215 $ 17,394 Reestimated Recoverable Latest 2,342 2,211 2,200 2,501 2,285 2,145 2,198 2,127 2,040 1,975 Net Reestimated Liability Latest $ 13,461 $ 14,784 $ 15,370 $ 14,824 $ 15,109 $ 15,260 $ 16,317 $ 16,625 $ 16,175 $ 15,419 Gross Cumulative Reestimate (Increase) Decrease $ (594 ) $ (581 ) $ (244 ) $ 57 $ 9 $ (524 ) $ (701 ) $ (1,893 ) $ (1,715 ) $ (704 ) The subsequent reductions in the net reserves established from December 31, 1993 to December 31, 1998 shown in the foregoing table reflects favorable severity trends that Allstate has experienced, as more fully discussed below. The increase in net reserves established for December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2002 reflects unfavorable reestimates as more fully discussed below. The following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended December 31, 2003. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable. The 12 amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s).

The favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. Favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs. The impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude. Beginning in the early 1990s, lower medical cost inflation rates, as evidenced by the consumer price index ("CPI") published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for medical costs, have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates. From 1991 through 1995, the medical CPI averaged 6.3%, and from 1996 through 2000, the average declined to 3.4%. The medical CPI is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies, including doctors fees, emergency care, therapy and rehabilitation, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are covered claims for insureds. In 2003, the medical CPI increased to 4.0%, and most recent economic forecasts anticipate further increases in medical inflation. If this occurs, future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates. Over time, our loss management programs have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends. We have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims, consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims, more accurate valuation of damages, and more effective negotiation and defense practices. These improvements have also involved hiring additional staff, providing increased training, creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims, and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims, claims with attorney involvement, and claims in litigation. These programs were intended to create an improved culture, focused on expert, efficient, and effective claim process management. Since 1993, growth of Allstates injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results. We believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements, and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates. While changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims, these changes can impact historical patterns of losses, introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims. 13 In 2003 and 2002, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2003, were due to favorable Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates, offset by unfavorable increases related to asbestos, and other discontinued lines. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2002 were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses related to asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In 2001, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported in the year 2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the Encompass and Canadian businesses.

REGULATION Allstate is subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S. the method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency and define standards of conduct. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of insurance policyholders rather than security holders. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, accounting methods, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Notes 13 and 15 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. In recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive. Holding Company Regulation. The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a 14 domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporations common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Arizona, California, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporations common stock. Price Regulation. Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the states regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file and use, or (iii) use and file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it. In states having file and use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulators approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Approximately one half of the states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing. An insurers ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurers ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. Changes in Allstates claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments. From time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of 15 pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit history for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing. Involuntary Markets. As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations. Guaranty Funds. Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. Investment Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments. As of December 31, 2003 the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries did not contain any investments that were non admitted for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non Renewing Policies. Most states regulate an insurers ability to exit a market. For example, some states limit a private passenger auto insurers ability to cancel and non renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department and not disapproved on the grounds that it could lead to market disruption. Regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurers ability to exit unprofitable markets. Variable Life Insurance, Variable Annuities and Registered Fixed Annuities. The sale of variable life insurance, variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers. Broker Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies. The Allstate entities that operate as broker dealers, registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company group. Until passage of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the Glass Steagall Act of 1933 had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers. With the passage of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, bank holding companies may acquire insurers and insurance holding companies may acquire banks. In addition, grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, including our parent company, may engage in activities that are not financial in nature. The ability of 16 banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Banking. The Allstate Corporation is a unitary thrift holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The principal supervisory authority for the thrift holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift Supervision. The bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking. Privacy Regulation. Federal law and the law of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal and state law also regulate disclosures of customer information. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information. Tax. State and federal laws affect the taxation of insurance companies. Congress and various state legislatures have occasionally considered proposals that, if enacted, could impose a greater tax burden on Allstate. Asbestos. Recently Congress has considered comprehensive federal legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation. However, unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos. Environmental. Environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini Superfund") govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties" (PRPs). Superfund and the mini Superfunds (Environmental Clean up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to pay for clean up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured PRPs and insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response, investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, applicability of several types of pollution exclusions, proper notice of claims, whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend, appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers, and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstates exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. Comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, but only modest reform measures have been enacted. 17 INTERNET WEBSITE Our Internet website address is allstate.com.

In the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003, Allstate Insurance Company paid dividends of $1.18 billion. Based on the greater of 2003 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that Allstate Insurance Company will be able to pay without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2004 is $2.71 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus. 21 Item 6.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5 year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Operations (which represents the Allstate Financial segment) sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The most important matters that we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include: For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency and severity trends, catastrophes, expenses and underwriting results; For Allstate Financial: investment and mortality margins, the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, premiums and deposits, expenses, operating income, invested assets and face amount of life insurance in force; For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration; For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage and debt leverage; and 23 For product distribution: Profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate agent sales of all products and services in order to meet the protection and financial needs of our customers. Net income increased in 2003 over 2002 due to higher Property Liability and Allstate Financial net income. Net income decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower Allstate Financial net income, partially offset by higher Property Liability net income. For further discussion of the results of our insurance segments, see the Property Liability and Allstate Financial Highlights sections of this MD&A. 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Net income increased 138.5% to $2.71 billion and net income per diluted share increased to $3.83. Total revenues reached a record $32.15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. Property Liability premiums earned increased 5.6% to $24.68 billion. The combined ratio improved 4.3 points to 94.6. Catastrophe losses increased to $1.49 billion, with an impact to the combined ratio of 6.0 points, compared to 3.1 points last year. Allstate Financial investments, including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year. Net realized capital gains in 2003 compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year, an improvement of $1.12 billion.

It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates relating to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities are difficult to observe and to characterize. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these 25 estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities. Periodic changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale (other than those accounted for under the cost or equity method) are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party, or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a securitys fair value is performed on a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent when assessing impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near term and long term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1) general economic conditions that are worse than assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuers ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result, the related unrealized loss, net of tax, would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, primarily in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transactions variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. The determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective 26 both at its inception and on an on going basis requires a significant degree of judgment. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. DAC related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, generally for periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. DAC related to traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issue and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies, change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. DAC related to interest sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15 30 years. However, an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used, which results in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. The rate of amortization during the surrender charge period is matched to the assumed pattern of EGP. EGP consists of estimates of the following components: margins from mortality including guaranteed minimum death and income benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses. The most significant assumptions involved in determining EGP are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees, surrender rates, lapse rates, and investment and mortality margins. Our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance after fees is approximately 8%, which is consistent with our pricing assumptions. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from 8%, we create an estimate of performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long term 8% assumption. This process is referred to as a "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the future rates of return after fees projected over the five year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking". For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Property Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to 27 settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date. Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled, and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determinable. We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us yet. The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be plus or minus 4.5%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, estimations of the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean up costs represent insured 28 property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulation. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Life Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when estimating the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. For further discussion of these policies see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A. PROPERTY LIABILITY 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 34, reached a record $25.19 billion during 2003. Compared to last year, premiums written increased 5.3% due to increases in the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners average premiums and the number of policies in force ("PIF"). Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums increased 16.8% and homeowners new business premiums increased 39.4%. The continued implementation of Strategic Risk Management ("SRM"), a multi phase strategy that integrates tier based pricing, underwriting and marketing decisions, resulted in a growing percentage of new business customers who are expected to provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. This improved lifetime value is a result of better loss ratios and higher retention of these customers. Underwriting income for Property Liability was $1.33 billion in 2003 compared to $263 million in 2002, with a combined ratio improvement of 4.3 points to 94.6. These improvements were a result of earned premium growth, favorable claim frequency and lower prior year reserve reestimates, but were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased severity of current year claims for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage. As a result of profit improvement actions, the Ivantage combined ratio improved 8.1 points in 2003 to 101.9 and the number of Ivantage standard auto and homeowners PIF declined 9.7% and 4.5%, respectively compared to December 31, 2002. 29 PROPERTY LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two lines of business, the Allstate brand and Ivantage, and is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Underwriting income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 31, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, restructuring and related charges, and in 2001, the amortization of goodwill, as determined using GAAP. This is one of the measures we use in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 30  Summarized financial data, key operating ratios and a reconciliation of underwriting income (loss) to net income for our Property Liability operations for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

We are seeking, through the utilization of SRM, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We continue to 31 enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. We have also aligned agency management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand by basing certain incentives on profitability, growth and sales of Allstate Financial products. In 2003, we have implemented and will maintain a broader marketing approach throughout the U.S. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brands exclusive agencies and enhancing The Good Hands&reg; Network. The Ivantage business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies. Ivantage includes standard auto and homeowners products with the EncompassSM brand name and non standard auto products with the Deerbrook&reg; brand name. Our strategy for Ivantage focuses on improving profitability for both Encompass and Deerbrook, and growing in select markets, in part by using SRM. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate brand systems has resulted in a different counting process for policies in force. As a result, recorded variances to prior year policies in force and average premium may be subject to some distortion until the integration is completed. The tier based pricing and underwriting used in SRM produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by our pre SRM standard/non standard model that we used and it is designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential for these customers. Our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non standard plans. In some states, we have implemented SRM and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan, which may also be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks. As the implementation of SRM continues, the distinctions between standard and non standard may become less important in certain states, depending upon how SRM is implemented. For this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto, including standard auto and non standard auto. However, we will continue to provide results for standard and non standard auto. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers. For Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners business written under SRM, our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who have lower loss ratios. The impact of SRM on our non standard business has been less pronounced because the impact has been mitigated by the effect of other non standard business initiatives, and as described above, because the implementation of SRM has meant that in some states we write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan. Because the implementation of SRM began in 1999 and has applied primarily to new business written since that time, today it accounts for about 35% of total premiums written. This amount will continue to increase since over 75% of new business is written using SRM rating plans. Another element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth, including managing exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels. Homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period of years. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze events not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing. Accordingly, homeowners products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products. 32 Allstate Protections goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity. Our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes. Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken during 2003 and 2002 will generally be recognized as premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned. % earned after (in millions) 2003 2002 90 days 180 days 270 days 360 days Allstate brand: Standard auto $ 3,481 $ 3,245 74.5 % 98.9 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Non standard auto 497 589 73.2 % 98.3 % 99.6 % 100.0 % Auto 3,978 3,834 74.3 % 98.8 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners 2,736 2,467 43.1 % 75.4 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 1,245 1,144 43.1 % 75.4 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Total Allstate brand 7,959 7,445 58.8 % 87.1 % 96.9 % 100.0 % Ivantage: Standard auto (Encompass) 602 594 44.5 % 76.1 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 45 38 74.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Auto 647 632 46.5 % 77.8 % 94.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners (Encompass) 266 250 43.6 % 75.5 % 94.0 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 67 50 43.7 % 75.7 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Total Ivantage 980 932 45.6 % 77.0 % 94.5 % 100.0 % Total Allstate Protection unearned premiums $ 8,939 $ 8,377 57.3 % 86.0 % 96.7 % 100.0 % 33 A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.

(2)2001 information not available. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2003 when compared to 2002 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. Higher average renewal premiums relate to rate actions taken in the current and prior year and, to a lesser degree, a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos. The increases in new business premiums, PIF and the renewal ratio in 2003 compared to 2002 are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. Declines in 2002 when compared to 2001 were primarily due to administrative and risk management actions taken to improve the standard auto loss ratio. These actions included implementing premium rate increases, down payment requirements and other underwriting changes in several large standard auto premium states. Ivantage standard auto premiums written increased in both 2003 and 2002 compared to the prior years due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy, partially offset by fewer new and renewal policies in force. Increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years. We expect the Ivantage standard auto PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue profitability actions. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for standard auto during 2003. # of States Weighted Average Rate Change (%) Annual Impact of Rate Changes on Premiums Written (%) Allstate brand 25 6.0 4.5 Ivantage (Encompass) 40 8.1 9.2 35 Non standard auto premiums written decreased 12.5% to $2.15 billion in 2003 from $2.45 billion in 2002, following an 8.2% decrease in 2002 from $2.67 billion in 2001.

(2)2001 information not available. Declines in Allstate brand non standard auto new and renewal business premiums during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to a decline in PIF. This decline was due to increases from new business PIF being offset by the declines in PIF related to an inherently low renewal ratio in this business, and to a lesser extent to a shift in writing business previously reported as non standard as standard auto using SRM. The increase in average premium during both years was due primarily to higher average renewal premiums due to rate actions. Ivantage non standard renewal business premiums increased in 2003 due to the re entry of Deerbrook in the non standard market during 2002. Since December 31, 2002, Deerbrook has been writing business in 19 states and consequently more stable trends in new business premiums, PIF and average premium have emerged in 2003 when compared to the prior year. The trends in non standard auto premiums are primarily due to the implementation of programs to address adverse profitability trends for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage. These actions varied by state and included changes to premium down payment requirements, tighter underwriting requirements, rate increases and certain other administrative actions. As a result, our competitive pricing position has declined. These trends are expected to continue, although at a lower rate, as we remain committed to profitable growth and focused on the utilization of SRM.

The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase in 2003 compared to the decrease in 2002 is the result of the increased competitiveness of our underwriting practices, products and rates in the homeowners market. The increases in average premium during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums in both years. Higher average renewal premiums were related to rate actions taken in the current and prior year. Increases in Ivantage homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year. We expect Ivantage PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue actions to improve profitability. 37 The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved during 2003. # of States Weighted Average Rate Change (%) Annual Impact of Rate Changes on Premiums Written (%) Allstate brand 20 1.8 (2) 1.2 Ivantage (Encompass) 40 (1) 11.7 15.3 (1)Includes Washington D.C.

The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity (average cost per claim). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A. 38 Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $497 million during 2002 compared to an underwriting loss of $627 million in 2001. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency, partially offset by increased current year claim severity and prior year reserve reestimates. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2003 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices, while during 2002 it was higher than the relevant medical cost indices. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends. However, auto injury claim severity could offset the success of these programs as was seen in 2002; therefore, we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs and profitability actions such as rate increases. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Body Work price index and the Used Car price index. In 2003 and 2002, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the weighted index. We believe that results can be favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims. Accordingly, we continue to pursue various loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends. However, during 2003 and 2002 the increase in auto physical damage claim severity more than offset the success of these programs. Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, and other economic and environmental factors. In 2003 we experienced a decline in homeowners severity while in 2002 we experienced an increase. Additional losses in 2002 were due to an increase in the volume of mold claims in Texas totaling $326 million. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase, offsetting the success of these programs. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. For example, we have implemented policy language in Texas and the majority of other states limiting payments for mold claims to $5,000 for specified remediation of mold that results from a covered water loss. 39  Loss ratios (the percentage of losses to premiums earned) are a measure of profitability. Loss ratios by product are shown in the following table.

These declines were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 0.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.3 points when compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned in the Allstate brand, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity. Non standard auto loss ratio declined 6.8 points for the Allstate brand and 24.3 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These declines were due to lower claim frequency, favorable reserve reestimates and higher premiums earned in Ivantage, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severities. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 10.6 points, while the Ivantage loss ratio increased 27.9 points. These fluctuations were due to lower claim frequency, offset by lower premiums earned in the Allstate brand and higher losses in Ivantage. Auto loss ratio declined 5.0 points for the Allstate brand and 9.9 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These declines were due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 2.3 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 5.1 points when 40 compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity. Homeowners loss ratio declined 12.6 points for the Allstate brand and increased 1.6 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and lower reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand, including lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims, offset by increased catastrophe losses, higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for Ivantage. Allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in Texas were negligible in 2003 compared to losses of $326 million in 2002 and $184 million in 2001. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 9.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.7 points when compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher mold related claims in the state of Texas. For homeowners, we implemented programs such as market or state specific product designs, rate increases, underwriting and rating changes, discontinuation of specific coverages, specific policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business. Because of the success of these programs we have returned this business to profitability during 2003, although in the future volatility in underwriting results caused by losses from events such as catastrophes may occur. We will continue these programs and introduce others to maintain profitability. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased in 2003 compared to 2002 after declining in 2002 from 2001 levels. The increase in 2003 was due to higher agent incentives, marketing expenditures, charitable contributions and employee related expenses. The decline in 2002 was due to various expense management initiatives partially offset by an increase in periodic pension costs. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table. Allstate brand Ivantage 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Amortization of DAC 13.9 13.3 13.2 19.1 19.8 20.2 Other costs and expenses 9.3 8.7 9.4 9.9 12.6 10.7 Amortization of goodwill 0.1 0.6 Restructuring and related charges 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.3 0.1 Total expense ratio 23.5 22.5 23.2 29.3 32.5 31.5 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 23.9 in 2003, 23.3 in 2002 and 23.9 in 2001. The expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is 4 to 5 points lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Ivantage expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates, integration expenses and expenditures for technology. Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was also favorably impacted in 2003 and 2002 by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling $69 million and $99 million, respectively. DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting costs and direct mail 41 solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned. The balance of DAC for each product type at December 31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted. We include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2003, catastrophe losses totaled $1.49 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $731 million in 2002 and $894 million in 2001. Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Actions we have taken to limit our exposure include restricting the amount and location of new business; limiting the availability of certain policy coverages; employing policy brokering; and increasing our participation in catastrophe pools. However, the impact of these actions may be mitigated by the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. We have also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane, tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes. We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States, and the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be California, areas surrounding the New Madrid fault system in the Midwest and faults in and surrounding Seattle, Washington and Charleston, South Carolina. For further disclosure of our participation in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the California Earthquake Authority, which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas, see Notes 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Historical Catastrophe Experience In the last 12 years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property Liability loss ratio was 6.2 pts. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the CEA, FHCF or brokered to a third party. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California 42 earthquakes, on our Property Liability loss ratio was 4.0 during the last 12 years. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last 11 years, excluding losses from Hurricane Andrew, California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes during that period was 15.7 points, with an impact of 16.0 in areas bordering the eastern and gulf coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of 15.3 in all other areas. The question of the impact of global climate change is an on going topic of discussion and so we continue to evaluate credible scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of climate change on our business. Allstate Protection Outlook We expect to see continued premium growth during 2004 as the result of increases in Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners PIF. Increased PIF is related to our pursuit of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S., including underwriting to additional SRM risk tiers, increased advertising and growth in the number and size of Allstate exclusive agencies. Because of our profitable results in 2003, we expect the level of premium rate changes in 2004 will diminish. We do not expect to experience significant premium growth in Ivantage during 2004 while we continue to pursue profitability actions in this business. We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results. We will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for advertising and technology. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost, increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments. DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums written $ 12 $ 7 $ 8 Premiums earned $ 13 $ 10 $ 15 Claims and claims expense (574 ) (233 ) (26 ) Other costs and expenses (10 ) (11 ) (12 ) Restructuring and related charges (1 ) Underwriting loss $ (571 ) $ (234 ) $ (24 ) During 2003, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reserve increases for asbestos totaling $514 million. Our annual "ground up" review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures resulted in an increase in asbestos reserves totaling $442 million. During the year, asbestos reserves were also increased $34 million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy, and by $38 million for an excess insurance policyholder who 43 submitted new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated, and therefore unexpected, coverage years. Reserves for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable and bad debts were increased by $26 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $23 million, $39 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures, resulting in an increase in reserves totaling $231 million, including increases for asbestos of $121 million, environmental of $26 million, other discontinued lines of $45 million, and costs of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures of $39 million. See the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves discussion for a more detailed description of our reserving practices. Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These potential losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information becoming known relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. PROPERTY LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 1.3% in 2003 when compared to last year, after decreasing 5.1% in 2002 when compared to 2001. In 2003, the increase was due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships, mostly offset by lower portfolio yields. In 2002, the decrease was due to lower portfolio yields and lower income from partnership interests, partially offset by higher portfolio balances due to positive cash flows from operations and investment activities. During 2002, we sold approximately $1 billion of the Property Liability equity securities portfolio. The proceeds of this sale were invested in fixed income securities, which generated higher net investment income. The following table presents the average pre tax investment yields(1) for the year ended December 31. 2003 2002 2001 Fixed income securities: tax exempt 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 % Fixed income securities: tax exempt equivalent 7.8 8.0 8.1 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.5 6.5 6.6 Equity securities 4.4 3.9 5.4 Mortgage loans 7.7 5.8 7.0 Total portfolio 5.3 5.6 6.0 (1)Pre tax yield is calculated as annualized investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the beginning and end of period investment balances. Amortized cost basis is used to calculate the average investment balance for fixed income securities. 44 Net realized capital gains and losses were $192 million in 2003 compared to ($314) million in 2002 and ($83) million in 2001. The following table presents the factors driving the net realized capital gains and losses results.

Investment Outlook The Property Liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases. Cash flows available for investment can be impacted by volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation. The amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the amount of Property Liability net investment income. Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments, calls and maturities, and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate. PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date. Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three year or two year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. 45 Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate. Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates. Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December 31, 2003, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $100 million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $100 million. For a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 46% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 14% in the third year, 9% in the fourth year, and the remaining 11% thereafter. 46  The table below shows total net reserves as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 for Allstate brand, Ivantage and Discontinued Lines and Coverages lines of business.

Auto reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to increasing severity trends for automobile repair and medical costs of $55 million for Ivantage operations and $17 million for Canadian operations, partially offset by reduced reserve 47 reestimates for the Allstate brand. In 2001, the favorable impact of Allstate brand auto reserve reestimates was partially offset by a greater than expected volume of late reported, unusual, weather related losses; adverse results of litigation; and increased reestimates of losses reported in prior years for the Ivantage and Canadian businesses. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to claim severity and late reported losses that were greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates. This resulted in reserve reestimates including $78 million related to IBNR, $95 million related to claim severity and $169 million related to mold claims in Texas. In addition, reserves were increased $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In March 2002, a new Texas homeowner policy form was implemented that restricted mold coverage from what had been provided by a previous broad state mandated policy form. As a result, coverage provided and the incidence of losses for mold diminished in the second half of the year. Reserve reestimates in 2003 and 2002 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of Californias Senate Bill 1899 in 1999. Increased homeowner reserve reestimates in 2001 were primarily due to $118 million of greater late reported unusual weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which was reported in the year 2001, increases to severity of homeowners losses reported in prior years totaling $172 million, and $125 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reserve reestimates in 2001 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of Californias Senate Bill 1899 in 1999. Other lines reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002, and 2001 were primarily the result of different claim severity development than anticipated in previous estimates. 48 Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. The Allstate brand experienced $386 million of unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2002. This was primarily due to $338 million of homeowners reestimates resulting from claim severity development and late reported losses that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates, including $169 million related to mold claims in Texas and $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were about $48 million for the year, of which $20 million was for Canadian business reserves. These reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for some of the small non auto products. Reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand claims in 2001 included a $348 million increase in the 2000 accident year losses offset by $122 million of net favorable reestimates for all prior years. Approximately $197 million of unfavorable reestimates for 2000 accident year losses was the result of unusually bad weather experienced at year end 2000, coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims. The remainder of the 2000 accident year loss reestimate was primarily attributable to increased severity for homeowner losses including mold related losses in Texas. For accident years prior to 2000, the net reestimate of $122 million included $125 million of adverse reestimates for Northridge related losses and $105 million of other litigation related adverse reestimates, offset by favorable reestimates. The preceding trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. 50 The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Reserve reestimates $ 209 $ (386 ) $ (226 ) Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) 1,941 681 (298 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting income (loss) 10.8 % (56.7 )% (75.8 )% Ivantage Reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were related to higher than anticipated claim settlement costs. In 2001, adverse reestimates also resulted from unusually bad weather experienced at year end 2000 coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims. The impact of these reestimates on the Ivantage underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Reserve reestimates $ (36 ) $ (68 ) $ (90 ) Ivantage underwriting (loss) income (38 ) (184 ) (329 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (94.7 )% (37.0 )% (27.4 )% Discontinued Lines and Coverages We conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders. Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2003 and 2001, and for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses in 2002. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 635 $ 520 $ 675 $ 121 $ 642 $ 94 Environmental Claims 304 2 343 26 429 (45 ) Other Discontinued Lines 491 52 476 84 553 (23 ) Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 1,430 $ 574 $ 1,494 $ 231 $ 1,624 $ 26 Underwriting (loss) income (571 ) (234 ) (24 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (100.5 )% (98.7 )% (108.3 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2003, totaling $520 million, were primarily for products related coverage. This increase essentially was a result of more claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business. This trend is consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry. We believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. 51 In 2002, asbestos reserves were increased by $121 million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures. Pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased to a minor extent. Reserve reestimates also included $45 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off and $39 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. In 2001, our annual review resulted in a $94 million reestimate of asbestos reserves due to increased emergence of reported losses. This was partially offset by a $45 million favorable reestimate of environmental reserves and $23 million of favorable reestimates in other discontinued lines due to improving loss emergence trends in these areas. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature. Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business. Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro rata coverage. Liability for actual and potential asbestos losses has caused a number of companies to file for bankruptcy protection. Of 63 companies that filed for bankruptcy as a result of significant asbestos exposure, on a direct (both primary and excess) insurance basis, we: Did not insure 43 Settled with 12 Reserved to excess insurance policy limits on 4 Reserved to maximum mutual agreed upon exposure on 1 52 Appropriately reserved for the remaining 3 Although we do not believe a greater exposure is probable for the remaining 3, our maximum additional exposure to full policy limits for the remaining 3 in the aggregate is $27 million, after tax. Reserves related to asbestos manufacturers in bankruptcy, whose claims are still in the process of resolution, are established based on claims that have occurred and other related information. The claim resolution process in these bankruptcies is lengthy and involves, among other factors, filing notices of claim by all current claimants, evaluating pre petition and post petition claims, negotiations among the various creditor groups and the debtors and, if necessary, evidentiary hearings by the bankruptcy court. We will continue to monitor the relevant bankruptcies. Our exposure, if any, to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers, including any currently in bankruptcy, would also arise if assumed reinsurance was written for an insurer providing insurance protection to a major asbestos manufacturer, and then only in proportion to our participation share. We assess our potential liability to each of our reinsurance programs and adjust reserves accordingly based on our knowledge of the losses of each reinsured exposure. Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country. The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 904 $ 635 $ 929 $ 675 $ 871 $ 642 Incurred claims and claims expense 800 520 180 121 158 94 Claims and claims expense paid (121 ) (76 ) (205 ) (161 ) (100 ) (61 ) Ending reserves $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 $ 929 $ 675 Annual survival ratio 13.1 14.2 4.4 3.9 9.3 11.1 3 year survival ratio 11.1 10.9 5.3 5.1 7.0 7.6 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 393 $ 304 $ 444 $ 343 $ 559 $ 429 Incurred claims and claims expense 2 34 26 (60 ) (45 ) Claims and claims expense paid (78 ) (49 ) (85 ) (65 ) (55 ) (41 ) Ending reserves $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 $ 444 $ 343 Annual survival ratio 4.0 5.2 4.6 4.7 8.1 8.4 3 year survival ratio 4.3 5.0 5.4 5.1 6.7 6.7 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 9.5 10.7 4.5 4.2 8.9 10.0 3 year survival ratio 8.8 8.9 5.3 5.1 6.9 7.3 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 59.9 % 53.5 % 58.4 % 53  The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. In 2003, the asbestos survival ratios increased (improved) due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. The environmental survival ratios decreased slightly due to a lower reserve balance. In 2002, both the asbestos and environmental survival ratios declined due to an increase in claims paid and reduced reserve levels, primarily due to commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn, caused increased claim payments and reduced reserve levels. The total commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2003, 2002 and 2001 excluding these commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 54 $ 33 $ 118 $ 102 $ 27 $ 18 Annual survival ratio 22.7 24.2 9.5 10.3 11.3 14.7 3 year survival ratio 21.9 22.2 11.0 12.5 11.8 15.4 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 42 $ 24 $ 29 $ 22 $ 23 $ 16 Annual survival ratio 8.4 10.0 6.6 6.9 13.7 13.7 3 year survival ratio 7.7 8.4 9.7 9.5 13.0 13.1 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 96 $ 57 $ 147 $ 124 $ 50 $ 34 Annual survival ratio 17.7 19.0 8.4 8.9 12.0 14.3 3 year survival ratio 16.7 16.9 10.6 11.3 12.2 14.5 Our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be a more representative, prospective measure of current reserve adequacy than other survival ratio calculations. Now at 22.2 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2003, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2003 would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately $31 million. 54 Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 (in millions) Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves(1) % of Reserves(1) Active Policy holders Net Reserves(1) % of Reserves(1) Direct policyholders: Primary 52 $ 28 3 % 40 $ 16 2 % 39 $ 12 2 % Excess 286 201 19 240 87 14 223 75 11 Total 338 229 22 % 280 103 16 % 262 87 13 % Assumed reinsurance 191 17 173 27 168 25 IBNR claims 659 61 359 57 421 62 Total net reserves $ 1,079 100 % $ 635 100 % $ 676 100 % Total reserve additions $ 514 (2) $ 121 $ 94 (1)To conform to the current year presentation, $8 million of asbestos reserves at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 have been reclassified from direct excess insurance policyholders to direct primary insurance policyholders. (2)Excludes a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. During the last three years, 190 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 104 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 86 during the period. The 86 increase comprised 58 from 2003, 18 from 2002 and 10 from 2001. The increase of 58 from 2003 included 85 new policyholders reporting new claims and 27 policyholders claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2003, totaled $514 million and included the following factors: Direct primary insurance net reserves increased by $12 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis. Direct excess insurance net reserves increased by $114 million for policyholders with existing active claims. The increase in existing active claims was attributable to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds. Assumed reinsurance net reserves increased by $18 million for increased cessions as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table. Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2002 Year ended December 31, 2001 New Claims(1) 265 197 182 (1)New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies. IBNR net reserves increased by $300 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2003 IBNR represented 61.1% of total asbestos reserves, 4 points higher than at December 31, 2002. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies. 55 Our non products case reserves represent approximately 4.7% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure. For environmental exposures a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Environmental loss emergence in 2002 was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other direct losses. In past years environmental reestimates have been favorable. Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table. Number of Claims 2003 2002 2001 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 6,900 6,426 6,004 New 2,267 1,165 967 Total closed (957 ) (691 ) (545 ) Pending, end of year 8,210 6,900 6,426 Closed without payment 594 444 281 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 7,352 8,486 8,744 New 954 845 1,028 Total closed (2,206 ) (1,979 ) (1,286 ) Pending, end of year 6,100 7,352 8,486 Closed without payment 1,776 1,442 737 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Other mass torts $ 234 $ 236 $ 228 Workers compensation 132 137 149 Commercial and other 135 118 99 Other discontinued lines $ 501 $ 491 $ 476 Other mass torts describes excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued primary, excess and reinsurance commercial 56 insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures. We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2004, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves. Property Liability Reinsurance Ceded We participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including both voluntary and mandatory industry pools and facilities, and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts. Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Mandatory industry pools and facilities $ 885 $ 935 $ 812 $ 838 Asbestos and environmental 1,898 1,297 636 423 Other 14,931 14,458 456 540 Total Property Liability $ 17,714 $ 16,690 $ 1,904 $ 1,801 We purchase reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $101 million and $85 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. 57 The ten largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property Liability reinsurer was in excess of $26 million and $30 million, respectively. We enter into certain inter company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Allstate Financial revenues increased 9.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was primarily due to lower net capital losses in 2003. Excluding net capital losses, revenues increased 2.3% in 2003 to $5.54 billion primarily due to increased net investment income. Net income increased to $305 million in 2003 from a net loss of $22 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to the 2002 impact of the change in accounting principle for goodwill that resulted in a charge of $283 million, after tax, and lower net realized capital losses in 2003, partly offset by higher income tax expense and an increased loss on disposition of operations. Investments, including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% to $76.32 billion due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year. Contractholder funds deposits totaled $10.63 billion for 2003 compared to $9.52 billion in 2002. The increase of $1.11 billion was primarily attributable to fixed annuity and institutional product deposits. 58 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a leading provider of life insurance, annuities and other financial services to a broad spectrum of individual and institutional customers.

Summarized financial data for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 Net investment income 3,233 3,121 2,962 Realized capital gains and losses (85 ) (432 ) (221 ) Total revenues 5,452 4,982 4,971 Costs and expenses Contract benefits (1,851 ) (1,770 ) (1,671 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (1,846 ) (1,764 ) (1,733 ) Amortization of DAC (538 ) (478 ) (402 ) Operating costs and expenses (672 ) (649 ) (567 ) Amortization of goodwill (29 ) Restructuring and related charges (7 ) (2 ) (8 ) Total costs and expenses (4,914 ) (4,663 ) (4,410 ) Loss on disposition of operations (46 ) (6 ) Income tax expense (170 ) (52 ) (192 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (17 ) (283 ) (6 ) Net income (loss) $ 305 $ (22 ) $ 363 Investments $ 62,895 $ 55,264 $ 46,066 Separate Accounts assets 13,425 11,125 13,587 Investments, including Separate Accounts assets $ 76,320 $ 66,389 $ 59,653 59 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life, immediate annuities with life contingencies and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life products, variable annuities, fixed annuities and other investment products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues. The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums Traditional life $ 388 $ 403 $ 446 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 413 416 333 Accident, health and other 564 552 566 Total premiums 1,365 1,371 1,345 Contract charges Interest sensitive life 618 597 558 Fixed annuities 37 32 36 Variable annuities 206 212 217 Institutional products 8 6 5 Accident, health and other 70 75 69 Total contract charges 939 922 885 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 319 $ 278 $ 252 Specialized brokers 390 415 332 Independent agents 373 351 354 Direct marketing 283 327 407 Total premiums 1,365 1,371 1,345 Contract charges Allstate agencies 440 429 381 Specialized brokers 30 25 24 Independent agents 279 271 274 Financial institutions and broker/dealers 187 197 206 Direct marketing 3 Total contract charges 939 922 885 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 Total premiums decreased 0.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of our direct response business, lower traditional life and immediate annuity premium, partially offset by higher premiums from accident, health and other products sold through the workplace. The decline in premiums from our direct response business reflects management actions over the past two years to discontinue this business. The decline in traditional life premium reflects a shift in product sales from traditional whole life policies to term insurance, which has lower premiums 60 and where we utilize more ceded reinsurance. The decline in immediate annuities with life contingencies was a result of underwriting actions to reduce the size of certain types of individual contracts sold in 2003. Total premiums were $1.37 billion in 2002 compared to $1.35 billion in 2001. The increase was due to increases in immediate annuities with life contingencies, partially offset by declines in traditional life, accident, health and other insurance products. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily related to the implementation of a reinsurance agreement on January 1, 2002 that ceded our direct response credit life insurance products and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product sales from traditional whole life insurance to term. Contract charges increased 1.8% to $939 million in 2003 compared to $922 million in 2002. Contract charges were consistent with the prior year as higher interest sensitive life contract charges resulting from in force business growth were partially offset by lower variable annuity contract charges, which resulted from lower average variable annuity account balances during the period. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 166 basis points in 2003 from 163 basis points in 2002 as a result of increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders. Contract charges increased 4.2% in 2002 compared to 2001 as contract charges on new sales of interest sensitive life products more than offset a decline from variable annuities. Variable annuity contract charges declined due to lower average account values during 2002 as poor equity market performance more than offset growth from deposits during the year. Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual products, such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, net bank deposits and institutional products, such as funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 40,751 $ 33,560 $ 28,870 Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 5,266 4,971 3,160 Institutional products 2,713 1,873 2,692 Interest sensitive life 1,074 964 925 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 893 1,212 1,194 Bank and other deposits 681 498 Total deposits 10,627 9,518 7,971 Interest credited 1,846 1,764 1,733 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Benefits and withdrawals (3,233 ) (2,522 ) (2,548 ) Maturities of institutional products (2,163 ) (1,056 ) (1,192 ) Contract charges (622 ) (567 ) (541 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (416 ) (474 ) (1,024 ) Fair value adjustments for institutional products 131 363 95 Other adjustments 150 165 196 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (6,153 ) (4,091 ) (5,014 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 47,071 $ 40,751 $ 33,560 61  Contractholder funds deposits increased 11.7% in 2003 compared to 2002, and average contractholder funds increased 18.2% in 2003 compared to 2002, due to significant increases in institutional product and fixed annuity deposits. Fixed annuity deposits increased 5.9% over 2002 due to competitive pricing and our decision to maintain a market presence despite a challenging interest rate environment. Fixed annuity deposits through our financial institutions distribution channel grew 40.0% in 2003 compared to 2002. This growth was a result of expanded relationships and consumers attraction to fixed rate contracts with shorter term rate guarantees due to volatile equity markets and the uncertainty of a low interest rate environment. This growth was partially offset by a decline in fixed annuities sold through our independent agencies distribution channel where longer term interest rate guarantees are generally favored. As a result of the low interest rate environment during 2003, we introduced fixed annuity contracts with lower guaranteed crediting rates. Institutional products deposits increased 44.8% largely due to our assessment of market opportunities. Benefits and withdrawals increased $711 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Benefits and withdrawals for 2003 represent 7.9% of the beginning of period contractholder funds balance, a slight increase compared to 7.5% in 2002. The increase reflects the aging of our in force contracts as the actual surrenders and withdrawals compared favorably to our expectations. Institutional product maturities increased $1.11 billion in 2003 as an increasing number of contracts issued in prior years reached their stated maturity dates. $1.91 billion is scheduled to mature in 2004. Contractholder funds deposits increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to significant increases in fixed annuity deposits and bank and other deposits, partially offset by a decline in institutional products. Fixed annuity deposits increased 57.3% over 2001 due to competitive pricing and the introduction of the Allstate&reg; Treasury Linked Annuity, which generated $761 million of deposits in 2002. Institutional deposits decreased 30.4% in 2002, as market conditions at times during the year would not allow us to achieve acceptable pricing returns. Average contractholder funds increased 19.0% in 2002 compared to 2001. Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related legally segregated separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 11,125 $ 13,587 $ 15,298 Variable annuity and life deposits 2,284 2,432 2,932 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (893 ) (1,212 ) (1,194 ) Net deposits 1,391 1,220 1,738 Investment results 2,393 (2,167 ) (2,262 ) Contract charges (220 ) (212 ) (190 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 416 474 1,024 Surrenders and benefits (1,680 ) (1,777 ) (2,021 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 13,425 $ 11,125 $ 13,587 Separate accounts liabilities increased $2.30 billion during 2003 compared to 2002 reflecting a significant improvement in investment results and net deposits. The increase in variable annuity net deposits resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and the introduction of the Allstate&reg; Advisor variable annuity product. Allstate Advisor is a multi manager variable annuity that offers funds from four mutual fund families. In volatile and uncertain equity markets, variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate 62 investment option. This allows contractholders to transfer funds to separate accounts equity investment funds over time and to purchase their equity investment fund shares at multiple fund price levels. This is commonly referred to as dollar cost averaging. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to the fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds. Separate accounts liabilities decreased $2.46 billion during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting the significant decline in equity markets and the resulting substantial decrease in variable annuity net deposits during the year. Net investment income increased 3.6% in 2003 compared to 2002 and 5.4% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increases were due to higher portfolio balances during the year as investment income on positive cash flows from product sales and deposits was mostly offset by lower portfolio yields. Investment balances as of December 31, 2003, excluding unrealized net capital gains, increased 14.5% from December 31, 2002 and increased 17.1% as of December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. The lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average. During 2003 we reclassified periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non hedge" for accounting purposes, to realized capital gains and losses so that they are reported consistently with the corresponding fair value adjustments on these instruments. The reclassifications decreased net investment income $22 million, $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 63 Net income analysis is presented in the following table.

Investment margin includes periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non hedge" for accounting purposes that are included in realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment margin increased 3.1% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a 15.5% increase in contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates where possible, partially offset by the decline in the portfolio yield of fixed income securities. For fixed annuities and life products for which we have the ability to modify crediting rates, the weighted average interest crediting rate was approximately 70 and 140 basis points above the long term underlying guaranteed rate at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The yield decline on the assets that support our capital, traditional life or other products for which the Company does not have the ability to modify crediting rates also had a significant negative impact on the investment margin during the year. The investment margin increased 11.7% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a 21.4% increase in contractholder funds. The impact of this growth was partially offset by a decline in portfolio yields from lower market interest rates affecting the yield on the investment of cash flows from operations and investments, and a shift to sales of investment products with lower 64 investment margins, such as market value adjusted annuities ("MVAA") and funding agreements that have lower capital requirements and cash flow variability. The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2003, 2002 and 2001. Weighted Average Investment Yield Weighted Average Interest Crediting Rate Weighted Average Investment Spreads 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Interest sensitive life 6.9 % 7.3 % 7.6 % 4.9 % 5.1 % 5.3 % 2.0 % 2.2 % 2.3 % Fixed annuities deferred 6.4 7.1 7.3 4.6 5.2 5.4 1.8 1.9 1.9 Fixed annuities immediate 7.9 8.2 8.5 7.1 7.2 7.5 0.8 1.0 1.0 Institutional 3.5 4.3 6.1 2.5 3.4 5.2 1.0 0.9 0.9 Investments supporting capital, traditional life and other products 6.2 6.9 7.7 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A The following table summarizes the liabilities as of December 31 for these contracts and policies.

An increase in guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuity contracts in 2003 compared to 2002 represents $30 million of the $53 million decline. The remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of 2003, poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non life credit insurance, partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest sensitive life and accident and health products sold through the workplace. In 2003, GMDB payments were $83 million, net of reinsurance, hedging results and other contractual arrangements ("net GMDB payments"), compared to $53 million and $31 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. While 2003 net GMDB payments were higher than in 2002, improved equity market performance during 2003 resulted in sequential quarterly reductions in gross GMDB payments. Direct response non life credit insurance generated a mortality margin of $2 million and $7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The mortality margin was comparable in 2002 and 2001 as increased contract charges from interest sensitive life growth were offset by increased policy benefits and net GMDB payments. Amortization of DAC increased 3.4% during 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to in force business growth, partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC increased 23.6% in 2002 compared 65 to 2001, primarily due to higher DAC unlocking and growth of business in force. Net DAC unlocking totaled $89 million, $94 million and $2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of DAC assumptions in the first quarter of 2003 and concluded that, due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the U.S. economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment, it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity fund returns would revert to the expected long term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model. As a result, we unlocked the DAC assumptions for all investment products, including variable and fixed annuities, and interest sensitive life products, to be consistent across all product lines. The 2003 unlocking of DAC assumptions included $124 million for variable annuities, partially offset by the effect of favorable investment margins on fixed annuities and favorable persistency on interest sensitive life products. The most significant assumption change involved resetting the variable annuity reversion to the mean calculation, such that future equity market performance during the five year reversion period was reduced from 13.25% after fees to the long term assumed return of 8% after fees. The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables. (in millions) Beginning balance December 31, 2002 Acquisition costs deferred Amortization charged to income Amortization (acceleration) deceleration charged to income(1) Effect of unrealized capital gains and losses Ending balance December 31, 2003 Traditional life $ 709 $ 83 $ (72 ) $ $ $ 720 Interest sensitive life 1,261 193 (136 ) 16 21 1,355 Variable annuities 834 143 (36 ) (124 ) (51 ) 766 Investment contracts 190 321 (141 ) 19 64 453 Accident, health and other 211 76 (64 ) 223 Total $ 3,205 $ 816 $ (449 ) $ (89 ) $ 34 $ 3,517 Beginning balance December 31, 2001 Acquisition costs deferred Amortization charged to income Amortization (acceleration) deceleration charged to income(1) Effect of unrealized capital gains and losses Ending balance December 31, 2002 Traditional life $ 694 $ 92 $ (77 ) $ $ $ 709 Interest sensitive life 1,274 196 (140 ) (6 ) (63 ) 1,261 Variable annuities 858 116 (25 ) (120 ) 5 834 Investment contracts 272 252 (79 ) 32 (287 ) 190 Accident, health and other 188 86 (63 ) 211 Total $ 3,286 $ 742 $ (384 ) $ (94 ) $ (345 ) $ 3,205 (1)Included as a component of Amortization of DAC on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe that as a result of the DAC unlocking performed in 2003, the variable annuity DAC asset is appropriately valued for the current economic environment. With moderate movements in the equity markets, the likelihood of future DAC unlocking is substantially reduced since the projected return in the mean reversion period is no longer at the maximum. 66 Operating costs and expenses increased 3.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Non deferrable acquisition costs $ 170 $ 139 $ 118 Other operating costs and expenses 502 510 449 Total operating costs and expenses $ 672 $ 649 $ 567 The increase in total operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher non deferrable acquisition costs such as renewal and annual trail commissions. Other operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 decreased as higher employee benefit and technology related costs were more than offset by lower litigation expense. Total operating costs and expenses increased 14.5% during 2002 compared to 2001 due to non deferrable acquisition costs, investments in technology, expansion of the workplace distribution channel, increased employee related benefits, advertising costs and litigation expenses. In 2003 and 2002, operating costs and expenses also include the Allstate Bank. Adjustments to prior year tax liabilities resulted in net unfavorable adjustments to net income of $11 million in 2003 compared with net favorable adjustments of $42 million in 2002. Net realized capital gains and losses are presented in the following table for the years ended December 31.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. For life insurance policies, depending upon the issue year and product, we may cede 90%, 80% or 60% of the mortality risk. As of December 31, 2003, 44% of our face amount of life insurance in force is reinsured. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on our long term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. 67 The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life insurance policy benefits at December 31, are summarized in the following table. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2003 2002 Life insurance $ 836 $ 751 Long term care 180 111 Other 201 220 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,217 $ 1,082 Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves. Developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been recent consolidation activity between reinsurers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. Additionally, one of our primary reinsurers has announced its intention to no longer assume life reinsurance risks. As a result, we plan to increase our retention of term life insurance and evaluate alternative reinsurance structures. Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by the reinsurers Standard & Poors financial strength ratings as of December 31, are shown in the following table. In certain cases, these ratings refer to the financial strength of the affiliated group or parent company of the reinsurer. 2003 2002 (in millions) Reinsurance Recoverable % Reinsurance Recoverable % AAA $ 22 1.8 % $ 3 0.3 % AA+ 80 7.4 AA 410 33.7 391 36.1 AA 271 22.3 372 34.4 A+ 304 25.0 180 16.6 A 1 0.1 2 0.2 A 167 13.7 2 0.2 Other 42 3.4 52 4.8 Total $ 1,217 100 % $ 1,082 100 % We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. At December 31, 2003, there were no reinsurance recoverable amounts that were greater than 60 days past due and we did not have an allowance established for them. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended December 31, 2003. We enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 68 Allstate Financial Outlook Our ability to grow our investment margin is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates, and growing the amount of business in force. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, we expect a reduction in our investment yields. The amount in which these lower yields will reduce our investment margin is contingent on our ability to lower interest crediting rates on certain interest sensitive products, which could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Also, a significant amount of our invested assets are used to support our capital and non interest sensitive products, which do not provide this offsetting opportunity. As a result, we expect growth in our investment margin from net new business, which also fluctuates in relation to the interest rate environment, to be partially offset by compression in our in force investment spreads. If equity markets perform at historical norms, we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue and lower net GMDB payments on our in force business. However, improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity markets performance creates a proportional increase or decrease in variable annuity amortization of DAC, which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. To eliminate some of these market concerns, we are expecting to retain more of our mortality risk in 2004. This change will have a diminutive effect on our net income in the short term, but will provide the foundation to drive increased long term growth in our life insurance business. Our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk, which will require increased statutory capital. INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolio. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. Overview and Strategy The investment strategy for the Property Liability portfolio emphasizes safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. The method for achieving this goal is based on a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerance as well as the risk/return parameters of various asset classes. This modeling, along with duration and liquidity considerations, is the guide for our asset allocation. On a tactical basis, decisions are made based on analysis of relative value opportunities across markets. Performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. Reviews of the portfolio are conducted regularly, including a portfolio monitoring process that identifies securities that are impaired on an other than temporary basis. For more information see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. This approach to balancing total return management with income needs and risk tolerances has produced competitive returns over time. 69  The investment strategy for Allstate Financial is also based upon a strategic asset allocation framework that takes into account the need to manage the portfolio on a risk adjusted spread basis for the underlying contract liabilities and to maximize return on retained capital. Generally, a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling is used to achieve a desired asset mix in the management of the portfolio. The strategic asset allocation model portfolio is the primary basis for setting annual asset allocation targets with respect to interest sensitive, illiquid and credit asset allocations as well as limitations with respect to overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. On a tactical basis, decisions are made on an option adjusted relative value basis staying within the constraints of the strategic asset allocation framework. We believe asset spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform on a long term basis and by using trading to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. Total return measurement is used on a selective basis where the asset risks are significant (e.g., high yield fixed income securities, convertible bonds). We expect that by employing this strategy we will minimize interest rate market impacts on investment income and provide sustainable investment income over time. Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2003 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information.

Amortized cost basis for these securities was $30.08 billion, $50.49 billion and $2.04 billion for Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively. Total investments increased to $103.08 billion at December 31, 2003 from $90.65 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities, increased unrealized gains on equity securities, assets consolidated pursuant to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs. Property Liability investments were $37.86 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $34.25 billion at December 31, 2002, due to positive cash flows from operations and increased unrealized gains on equity securities, partially offset by dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation. Allstate Financial investments increased to $62.90 billion at December 31, 2003, from $55.26 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in Allstate Financial investments was primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs. Corporate and Other investments increased to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of two variable interest entities ("VIEs") used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under FIN 46. For further disclosure of this consolidation, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A. 70 Total investment balances related to collateral, primarily due to securities lending, increased to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2003, from $2.98 billion at December 31, 2002. We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. The following table shows the investment portfolio, and the sources of its fair value, at December 31, 2003. Investments Derivative Contracts (in millions) Fair Value Percent to total Fair Value Value based on independent market quotations $ 81,269 78.8 % $ (1 ) Value based on models and other valuation methods 12,643 12.3 548 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 9,169 8.9 Total $ 103,081 100.0 % $ 547 Fixed Income Securities See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income securities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. U.S. government and agencies of the U.S. government securities were all rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $24.81 billion and 95.9% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Approximately 59.0% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by 7 bond insurers and accordingly have a rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2003 consisted of approximately 3,300 issues from approximately 2,300 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was less than 1.1% of the municipal bond portfolio. The ultimate obligors of approximately 12% of the municipal bond portfolio were corporate entities. Corporate bonds totaled $36.49 billion and 87.1% were rated as investment grade at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the fixed income securities portfolio contained $15.84 billion of privately placed corporate obligations or 43.4% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $13.08 billion at December 31, 2002. The benefits of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds on many bonds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk and fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2003, 81.5% of the privately placed securities were rated as investment grade. Foreign government securities totaled $2.47 billion and 94.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Mortgage backed securities ("MBS") totaled $14.64 billion at December 31, 2003. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is also subject to 71 interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying mortgages. We attempt to limit interest rate risk on these securities by investing a portion of the portfolio in securities that provide prepayment protection. At December 31, 2003, approximately 29.3% of the MBS portfolio was invested in planned amortization class bonds or the equivalent. Though these security types offer greater relative prepayment protection than other MBS securities, the degree of protection has been limited in this interest rate environment. Based on market conditions and potential changes in portfolio management objectives, the value of this protection and the significance of these holdings relative to the entire portfolio may be reduced in future periods. Asset backed securities ("ABS") totaled $5.10 billion at December 31, 2003. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is mitigated by monitoring the performance of the collateral. Approximately 61.0% of the ABS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. The ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying assets. Approximately 33.0% of the ABS portfolio is invested in securitized credit card receivables. The remainder of the portfolio is primarily backed by securitized home equity, manufactured housing or auto loans. At December 31, 2003, 93.2% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a Moodys equivalent rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa; an S&P equivalent rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB; or a comparable internal rating. The following table summarizes the credit quality of the fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2003.

The equity securities portfolio was $5.29 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $3.68 billion in 2002. The increase is attributable to higher unrealized net capital gains during 2003 and new money from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.28 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $562 million at December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses totaled $18 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $102 million at December 31, 2002. Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining that they are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December 31, 2003 were $6.40 billion, an increase of $906 million 72 or 16.5% since December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the corporate fixed income portfolios and were comprised of securities in the following sectors.

The gross unrealized losses in these sectors are primarily company specific or interest rate related. While we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003. 73 The equity portfolio is comprised of securities in the following sectors. Gross unrealized At December 31, 2003 Fair value Cost Gains Losses (in millions) Consumer goods (cyclical and non cyclical) $ 882 $ 290 $ (10 ) $ 1,162 Technology 440 173 (3 ) 610 Financial services 441 163 (1 ) 603 Real estate 380 173 (1 ) 552 Capital goods 265 146 411 Banking 269 77 (1 ) 345 Communications 251 85 336 Energy 161 81 242 Basic industry 161 51 (1 ) 211 Utilities 114 23 (1 ) 136 Transportation 41 8 49 Other 623 8 631 Total equities $ 4,028 $ 1,278 $ (18 ) $ 5,288 During 2003, we have experienced an increase in gross unrealized gains and a decrease in gross unrealized losses as a result of a recovering equity market. The consumer goods sector has the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio at December 31, 2003, which were primarily company specific. While we expect eventual recovery of these securities and this sector, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003. The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2003. NAIC Rating Moodys, S&P or Equivalent Unrealized Loss Percent to Total Fair Value Percent to Total (in millions) 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ (189 ) 51.1 % $ 8,207 72.1 % 2 Baa (73 ) 19.7 2,120 18.6 3 Ba (34 ) 9.2 522 4.6 4 B (40 ) 10.8 314 2.8 5 Caa or lower (19 ) 5.1 142 1.2 6 In or near default (15 ) 4.1 74 0.7 Total $ (370 ) 100.0 % $ 11,379 100.0 % The table above includes redeemable preferred securities with a fair value of $46 million and an unrealized loss of $5 million. It also includes 73 securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a rating based on an analysis similar to that used by the NAIC, with a fair value totaling $896 million and an unrealized loss of $16 million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, processing of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC ("SVO"), and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating. At December 31, 2003, $262 million, or 70.8%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired. 74 As of December 31, 2003, $108 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 34.0% was in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003. Included among the securities that are rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were purchased at investment grade, but have since been downgraded. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities and through diversification of the portfolio. The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003 is shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of repayments by the issuers.

Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list. The watch list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists. The unrealized loss balance for fixed income and equity securities can be further segmented into the following four categories of securities, with the unrealized net loss in each category at December 31, 2003 listed in parenthesis: (i)Securities with an unrealized loss less than 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities ($290 million of unrealized loss); (ii)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of less than six consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($53 million of unrealized loss); (iii)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of six or more consecutive months, but less than 12 consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($31 million of unrealized loss); and (iv)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for twelve or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($14 million of unrealized loss). 75 Categories (i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by the downturn in the financial markets, overall economic conditions, and the markets evaluation of certain sectors. While all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment, the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. In general, we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time. For category (iii) there were 6 equity securities with a fair value of $1 million and 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $58 million and $31 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being $7 million. Of the fixed income securities in this category, 7 securities with a fair value of $51 million and an unrealized loss of $23 million were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003. For category (iv) there were 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $37 million and $14 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being $5 million. All of these securities were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003. Whenever we decide that a fixed income securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12 months is temporary, we use a process of additional evaluations and management approvals to determine why a write down is not required. The following table contains the individual securities as of December 31, 2003, with the largest unrealized losses. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than 1.0% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities: (in millions) Unrealized Loss Fair Value NAIC Rating Unrealized Loss Category State General Obligation for a Pension Fund $ (8 ) $ 92 1 (i ) Shipping & Offshore Engineering (7 ) 13 5 (iii ) Foreign Dairy Conglomerate (7 ) 13 6 (ii ) Food Processing Company (6 ) 14 N/A (ii ) Chemical/Plastics Production & Distribution (5 ) 15 4 (iii ) Asset Backed Security for Aircraft Leases (5 ) 12 3 (iv ) Total $ (38 ) $ 159 We also monitor the quality of our fixed income portfolio by categorizing certain investments as "problem", "restructured" or "potential problem." Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have serious concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future. 76 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December 31. 2003 2002 Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Problem $ 325 $ 322 0.4 % $ 295 $ 279 0.4 % Restructured 64 64 0.1 42 36 Potential problem 397 382 0.4 647 572 0.7 Total net carrying value $ 786 $ 768 0.9 % $ 984 $ 887 1.1 % Cumulative write downs recognized $ 347 $ 474 We have experienced a decrease in our balance of fixed income securities categorized as potential problem as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. The decrease was related primarily to the sale of holdings in this category due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities. We also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003 and recorded write downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio. Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December 31. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Investment write downs $ (294 ) $ (467 ) $ (277 ) Sales 453 (221 ) 43 Valuation of derivative instruments 16 (60 ) (123 ) Settlement of derivative instruments 21 (176 ) 5 Realized capital gains and losses, pretax 196 (924 ) (352 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (62 ) 326 127 Realized capital gains and losses, after tax $ 134 $ (598 ) $ (225 ) Investment write downs during 2003 represented approximately 0.3% of the average total investment portfolio value during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the $453 million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of $851 million and gross losses of $398 million. Gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities were $396 million which, combined with investment write downs on fixed income and equity securities of $290 million, represents total gross realized losses of $686 million. Of the $396 million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities, $264 million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and $132 million resulted from sales of equity securities. In 2003, losses from sales were primarily related to routine reductions of exposures to deteriorating credits, reallocation of funds to other investments in a higher interest rate environment and equity portfolio turnover resulting from relative value opportunities. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Recognizing in certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent 77 credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security. The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $82 million with the largest being $42 million and the smallest being $3 million. Of those losses, four related to securities that were in our unrealized loss categories (iii) or (iv). Our largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns by issuer and its affiliates are shown in the following table. No other issuer and its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and writedowns greater than 2.0% of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities. We have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held.

Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk. We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans of $4 million, $2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Short Term Investments Our short term investment portfolio was $1.82 billion and $2.22 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of one year or less. We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is subsequently invested and included in short term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2003, the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of $569 million. This compares to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2002. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. Overview We generate substantial investable funds from our Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business. Investment guidelines define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over these risk management activities. In addition, the subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow guidelines that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and that specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given their liquidity, surplus, product, and regulatory requirements. Executive oversight of investment 79 risk management processes is conducted primarily through the boards of directors and investment committees of the subsidiaries conducting investment activities. Administration and detailed managerial oversight of investment risk, including market risk, is provided through our credit and risk management committee ("CRMC"). We also have an enterprise wide committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC") that is responsible for assessing risks, including market and other investment risks, on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations. We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation limits, duration limits and value at risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets over a time interval based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by the investment guidelines. Although we apply a common overall governance approach to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur an economic loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and carry significant interest sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations. We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2003, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.99, compared to a 0.34 gap at December 31, 2002. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. Most of our duration gap results from the Property Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property Liability assets and liabilities. For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit exposure to interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy includes using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from unintended duration mismatches between assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk related to anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers. 80 We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $42 million as of December 31, 2003. For over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2003, counterparties have posted collateral to us totaling $333 million. To calculate duration, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of Property Liability policies. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.77 billion, compared to $825 million at December 31, 2002. Additionally, there are $6.20 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments and as a result have not been included in the above estimate. This amount has increased from the $5.58 billion reported at December 31, 2002 due to increases in policies in force. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, these assets would decrease in value by $278 million, compared to a decrease of $218 million at December 31, 2002. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2003, we would recognize realized capital gains and losses totaling $13 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $(13) million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates. Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock, mutual fund, or stock index. At December 31, 2003, we held approximately $4.42 billion in common stocks and $1.30 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds and non redeemable preferred securities), compared to approximately $2.79 billion in common stocks and $1.15 billion in other equity investments at December 31, 2002. Approximately 99.0% and 58.8% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of 81 the Property Liability operations at December 31, 2003, compared to approximately 98.6% and 52.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, our portfolio of equity instruments had a beta of approximately 0.84, compared to a beta of approximately 0.79 at December 31, 2002. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, in mathematical terms, an investments market risk characteristics relative to the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will decrease by approximately 8.4%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will increase by approximately 8.4%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2003, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity portfolio identified above by approximately $478 million, compared to $312 million at December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The beta of our equity portfolio was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity portfolio to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had separate accounts assets with account values totaling $13.43 billion and $11.13 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $21 million and $18 million less in fee income at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial usually have a GMDB and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced GMDB, guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") prior to 2004 and beginning in 2004 a TrueReturnSM Accumulation Benefit ("GMAB") on certain contracts. These guarantees subject us to additional equity risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than the current account value. GMDBs are payable upon death, while GMIBs are payable on or after the ten year anniversary of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are payable on a date that is pre determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year of the contract. GMABs guarantee a return of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $2.46 billion and $4.07 billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2003. In both periods, approximately two thirds of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining one third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments during 2003 that were intended to offset a portion of 2003 expected death benefit payments and the risk of future death claims on all new business issued on January 1, 2003 and later, and any payments of GMABs. We estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMDBs for the next 40 quarters to be approximately $145 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $264 million at December 31, 2002. In order to calculate this estimate, we considered the current guarantees outstanding for all contracts that contain GMDBs, the expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for 82 DAC amortization. The decrease in this estimate at December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to the equity market improvement during the year. We also estimate the effect on expected future GMDB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December 31, 2003 would increase by an estimated $18 million during the next year. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model. Included among the GMIB contracts we have sold are contracts that provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed benefit feature was first offered in certain of our GMIB products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by the contractholders beginning in 2008. We estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMIBs for the next 40 years to be approximately $15 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $16 million at December 31, 2002. In calculating this estimate we considered the current mix of guarantees outstanding, expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for DAC amortization. The decrease in 2003 is primarily due to improved equity markets in 2003, partially offset by the fact that contractholders are one year closer to being eligible to annuitize. We also estimate the effect on our expected future GMIB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders account values as of December 31, 2003 due to equity market declines, there would be no immediate effect on our earnings or cash flow, since these benefits are not payable until at least 2008. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. As of December 31, 2003 we do not have a reserve established for the GMDBs or GMIBs; however, this will change with the adoption of Statement of Position 03 01 in 2004. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this pending accounting change. Additional sales of variable annuity contracts will increase our equity risk because of these benefits. An increase in the equity markets above the December 31, 2003 level will increase account values for these contracts, thereby decreasing the risk of the GMDBs, GMIBs and GMABs being utilized in the future. Likewise, a decrease in the equity markets that causes a decrease in the account values will increase our equity risk because of these benefits. In addition to our GMDB and GMIB equity risk, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 we had approximately $1.55 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively, in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with guaranteed crediting rates based on the price of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits. Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable life and annuity contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small 83 amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $380 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $492 million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $246 million and $375 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property Liability business. Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $87 million, compared with an estimated $62 million decrease at December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 31 countries, slightly reduced from 35 countries at December 31, 2002. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2003 were to the Canadian dollar (58.9%) and the British pound (10.5%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2002 were to the Canadian dollar (60.7%) and the British pound (7.3%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.8% at December 31, 2003, compared to 26.7% at December 31, 2002. The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents. See Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. Net periodic pension cost in 2004 is estimated to be $291 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2003 and 2002 principally due to unfavorable returns on plan assets, and decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on market trends and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In each of the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from benefit payments made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as payments continue to be made to agents in connection with the reorganization of Allstates multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program during 2000. As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period, which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in 2002 and 2001 primarily due to the decline in the equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in 84 increased amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $92 million in 2003 and $11 million in 2002. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the projected benefit obligations or 10% of the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poors or at least "Aa" by Moodys on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $48 million in net periodic pension cost and a $762 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2003, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $40 million in net periodic pension cost and a $224 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $40 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by $52 million as of October 31, 2003, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $36 million and a $207 million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2002. This non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $34 million in pension cost at October 31, 2003, compared to an increase of $26 million at October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $34 million at October 31, 2003, compared to a decrease of $26 million at October 31, 2002. Changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability. 85 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December 31. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders equity items $ 17,809 $ 15,705 $ 15,533 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,756 1,733 1,663 Total shareholders equity 20,565 17,438 17,196 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 200 200 Debt 5,076 4,240 3,921 Total capital resources $ 25,641 $ 21,878 $ 21,317 Ratio of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to shareholders equity 24.7 % 25.5 % 24.0 % Shareholders equity increased in 2003 when compared to 2002, as net income, unrealized net capital gains on investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. Shareholders equity increased in 2002 when compared to 2001, due to higher net income and unrealized capital gains that were partially offset by an increase in the minimum pension liability, dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. In February 2004, we announced a $1.00 billion increase in the current share repurchase program. As of the date of this announcement, the current share repurchase program had $1.35 billion remaining, and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2005. Treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity, and since 1995, we have repurchased 263 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.53 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 68 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were eliminated as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position effective July 1, 2003, because of the adoption of FIN 46. This accounting guidance required the de consolidation of Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a subsidiary that we own 100%, and the recognition of debt that we had previously issued to AF II, the proceeds of which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. For further discussion of the capital structure of AF II, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. Debt increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the adoption of FIN 46 and increases in long term borrowings outstanding, partly offset by declines in short term borrowings outstanding. The adoption of FIN 46, effective July 1, 2003, increased long term debt by $1.05 billion, including $691 million for the consolidation of two VIEs to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third party investors, $112 million for the consolidation of a VIE for a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores, $45 million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated investment security, and $200 million of the debt we issued to AF II that is no longer required to be consolidated. Although we are required to consolidate the two VIEs used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under FIN 46, we have no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt. Our maximum exposure related to these two entities is the current value of our equity investment, which totaled $12 million at December 31, 2003. Moodys and Standard and Poors have apprised us that the reported debt associated with the consolidation of these VIEs will 86 be excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders equity for ratings considerations. This analytical ratio was 21.3% as of December 31, 2003. For more information on the adoption of FIN 46, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. In June 2003, we issued $400 million of 5.350% Senior Notes due in 2033, utilizing the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the $300 million of 63/4% Notes due 2003 and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2003, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The increase in debt in 2002 compared to the 2001 level was primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2012, and the issuance of $250 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2032. The proceeds of the $350 million issuance were used for general corporate purposes, and the proceeds of the $250 million issuance were used to redeem $250 million of 7?% Senior Quarterly Interest Bonds. Both of the senior note issuances in 2002 were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2000. Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December 31, 2003. Moodys Standard & Poors A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P 1 A 1 AMB 1 Allstate Insurance Company (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ American Heritage Life Insurance Company (financial strength) Aa3 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. In February 2004, A.M. Best revised the outlook to stable from positive for the insurance financial strength ratings of ALIC and certain rated subsidiaries and affiliates. The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a companys premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AICs premium to surplus ratio was 1.5x on December 31, 2003 compared to 1.7x in the prior year. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurers risk based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurers solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2003, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions. 87  The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges. Liquidity Sources and Uses Our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table. Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Receipt of insurance premiums X X Allstate Financial contractholder fund deposits X Reinsurance recoveries X X Receipts of principal, interest and dividends on investments X X X Sales of investments X X X Funds from investment repurchase agreements, securities lending, dollar roll, commercial paper and lines of credit agreements X X X Inter company loans and tax refunds/settlements X X X Capital contributions from parent X X Dividends from subsidiaries X X X Funds from periodic issuance of additional securities X Funds from the settlement of our benefit plans X Our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table.

Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Consolidated (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,450 $ 2,543 $ 535 $ 2,256 $ 1,887 $ 1,771 $ (15 ) $ (7 ) $ (15 ) $ 5,691 $ 4,423 $ 2,291 Investing activities (2,344 ) (1,613 ) 628 (6,769 ) (7,560 ) (4,822 ) (351 ) 165 (166 ) (9,464 ) (9,008 ) (4,360 ) Financing activities 11 92 (1,190 ) 4,554 5,443 3,115 (888 ) (751 ) 185 3,677 4,784 2,110 Net increase in consolidated cash $ (96 ) $ 199 $ 41 Property Liability Higher operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to increased underwriting income. In 2003, operating cash flows were also impacted by contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2003 and 2002 as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios. Cash flows of the Property Liability business are also impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation. These dividends totaled $1.18 billion, $675 million and $1.24 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Allstate Financial Higher operating cash flows of Allstate Financial in 2003 and 2002 primarily relates to increases in investment income, partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth. Cash flows used in investing activities declined in 2003 compared to 2002 as the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow. Lower cash flow from financing activities during 2003 reflects an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders accounts, partially offset by increased deposits received from contractholders. Higher cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects increased deposits received from contractholders. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financials liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2003. Approximately 14.8% of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment. (in millions) 2003 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 11,266 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges(1) 19,526 Market value 9,316 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 6,963 Total Contractholder funds $ 47,071 (1)Includes $9.81 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. 89 Corporate and Other Higher uses of cash in the investing activities of our Corporate and Other segment during 2003 reflect additional net investments made in the portfolio of the subsidiary, Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, when we increase or decrease the level of these activities, financing cash flows are affected. Long term debt and invested assets increased during 2003 related to the adoption of FIN 46. However since these increases did not impact our cash flows and were non cash entries, they had no impact to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines of credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2003 these sources could provide over $2.3 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of the investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $15.84 billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent 15.4% of the investment portfolio, and $6.54 billion of mortgage loans that represent 6.3% of the investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios. We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows: A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily. Two primary credit facilities and one additional credit facility totaling $1.20 billion to cover short term liquidity requirements. These consist of a $575 million five year revolving line of credit expiring in 2006, a $575 million 364 day revolving line of credit expiring in the second quarter of 2004 and a $50 million one year revolving line of credit expiring in the third quarter of 2004. The right to borrow under the five year and 364 day facilities is subject to requirements that are customary for facilities of this size, type and purpose. These requirements are currently being met and we expect to continue to meet them in the future. There were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit during 2003. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the three credit facilities is limited to $1.20 billion. The right to issue up to an additional $2.80 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long term debt rating of A1 and A+ (from Moodys and Standard & Poors, respectively) to non investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB , a downgrade in AICs financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A , or a downgrade in ALICs financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA /A . The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, and therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 90 Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Securities Lending, Dollar Rolls, and Repurchase Agreements(1) $ 3,416 $ 3,416 $ $ $ Guaranteed Investment Contracts ("GICs")/Funding Agreements (non putable)(2) 7,762 1,809 2,513 1,350 2,090 Funding Agreements (putable/callable)(2) 1,794 778 1,016 Payout Annuities/Structured Settlements(3) 30,765 841 2,528 1,619 25,777 Long Term Debt(4) 5,074 1,605 1 3,468 Capital Lease Obligations(4) 36 2 3 4 27 Operating Leases(4) 944 247 324 184 189 Unconditional Purchase Obligations(4) 392 223 121 48 Pension Obligations(4),(5) 163 151 8 4 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 50,346 $ 7,467 $ 8,118 $ 3,210 $ 31,551 (1)Securities lending, dollar rolls and repurchase transactions are typically fully collateralized with marketable securities. We manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. (2)The putable/callable funding agreement program as well as the non putable funding agreement and GIC programs are very closely asset/liability duration matched by ALIC. Accordingly, ALIC maintains assets with a sufficient market value to extinguish the liabilities in the normal course of business upon expected surrender or maturity of the related contracts. (3)ALIC closely manages the assets supporting payout annuities/structured settlement liabilities. (4)Our payment obligations relating to long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program. (5)Pension obligations represent approved contributions to our pension plans. Our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2003 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Conditional(1) $ 152 $ 152 $ $ $ Other Commitments Unconditional(1) 510 57 177 208 68 Total Commitments $ 662 $ 209 $ 177 $ 208 $ 68 (1)Represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans. We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required. 91 REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Regulation We are subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. Recent state and federal regulatory initiatives and proceedings have included efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies, limit insurers ability to impose underwriting standards and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on our business, if any, are uncertain. Legal Proceedings We are involved in various legal and regulatory actions that have an effect on specific aspects of our business. Like other members of the insurance industry, we are the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. For a detailed description of these actions, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December 31, 2003, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. These standards include Statement of Position 03 01, FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic number 03 01. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on our interpretation and application of Statement of Position 03 01, we estimate that upon adoption on January 1, 2004, it will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the range of $150 million to $200 million. However, the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services. 92 Risks Relating to the Property Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tropical storms, wildfires and terrorism. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, totaling $2.3 billion, and to the Northridge earthquake of 1994, totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various Florida state created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as snowstorms, ice storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur. Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Property Liability business. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of changes in the rate of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of Texas. Although we are currently pursuing various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment that seek to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. Recently, our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The recent favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but not reported, after considering known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar losses, historical trends involving claim payment 93 patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active claims; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position. Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Moreover, because Allstate Protections loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurers ability to charge an adequate price or mandating subsidized rates. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at an inadequate or subsidized price, leading to an unacceptable return on capital. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurers ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. The potential benefits of implementing SRM may not be fully realized We believe that the tier based pricing and underwriting approach (including the use of credit history as an underwriting criterion) used in SRM has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, our competitors may adopt underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models similar to those used in SRM. Further, the use of credit history as a factor in underwriting and 94 pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify SRM. Furthermore, because we have been using SRM only for the last several years, we cannot make assurances that SRM underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated through the use of SRM. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using SRM will increase may not be realized. Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. In 2002 and 2003, prices in Allstate Protections principal lines increased more quickly than in prior years, and underwriting standards became more stringent. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review and revise our reserve estimates and if future experience differs from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates on business. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, assets may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. For example, during 2003 the average pre tax investment yield for the Allstate Financial portfolio declined to 6.0% from 6.7% in 2002. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segments investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability. Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the United States and international stock markets affect Allstate Financials sales of variable annuities. Recent allegations of improper or illegal trading activities at large mutual fund 95 complexes could affect the stock markets. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB and GMAB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or Allstate Financials net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest sensitive life, variable annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. This risk may be heightened by the enactment of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act"), which eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurers and other financial service providers. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products (primarily life insurance and annuities) we offer receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. One such proposal was enacted in May 2003 when President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, recent changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. 96  Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar insurance products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we may face increased competition from banks. Until passage of the GLB Act, the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses was limited and banks were restricted from being affiliated with insurers. With the passage of the GLB Act, mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company are now permitted. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. Changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolios average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. A declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans. We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large insurance group, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation. Among other things, we, like other participants in the insurance industry, have been subject in recent years to an increasing volume of class action litigation challenging a range of industry practices. Our litigation exposure could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation. For a description of our current material litigation matters, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth We are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance regulators. This regulation is focused on the protection of policyholders and not investors. In many cases, state regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Additionally, we have various entities registered under the federal securities laws as broker dealers, investment advisers and or investment companies. These entities are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the SEC, the National Association of 97 Securities Dealers and, in some cases, state securities administrators. The laws regulating the securities products and activities of Allstate Financial are complex, numerous and subject to change. Further, in recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and proposals that would provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies have been discussed by members of Congress. We can make no assurances as to whether further state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance industry or as to the effect that any such measures would have on us. The unavailability of reinsurance may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure or reduce our insurance writings. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim expense we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. In the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial may be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally will have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a decline in the value of an insurers investment portfolio or increased liabilities for variable contracts arising from additional GMDB, GMIB or GMAB exposure resulting from market declines. Currently, the insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively). Because these ratings are subject to periodic review, the continued retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, including the competitiveness and marketability of our product offerings, as well as our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. 98 Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. Item 7A.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5 year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Operations (which represents the Allstate Financial segment) sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The most important matters that we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include: For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency and severity trends, catastrophes, expenses and underwriting results; For Allstate Financial: investment and mortality margins, the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, premiums and deposits, expenses, operating income, invested assets and face amount of life insurance in force; For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration; For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage and debt leverage; and 23 For product distribution: Profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate agent sales of all products and services in order to meet the protection and financial needs of our customers. Net income increased in 2003 over 2002 due to higher Property Liability and Allstate Financial net income. Net income decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower Allstate Financial net income, partially offset by higher Property Liability net income. For further discussion of the results of our insurance segments, see the Property Liability and Allstate Financial Highlights sections of this MD&A. 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Net income increased 138.5% to $2.71 billion and net income per diluted share increased to $3.83. Total revenues reached a record $32.15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. Property Liability premiums earned increased 5.6% to $24.68 billion. The combined ratio improved 4.3 points to 94.6. Catastrophe losses increased to $1.49 billion, with an impact to the combined ratio of 6.0 points, compared to 3.1 points last year. Allstate Financial investments, including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year. Net realized capital gains in 2003 compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year, an improvement of $1.12 billion. Repurchased shares of stock totaling $150 million during 2003 through the repurchase program, of which $350 million remained at December 31, 2003. Announced an increase of $1.00 billion to this program in February 2004, to be completed by December 31, 2005. Book value per share increased 17.3% to $29.04. Return on equity improved 7.7 points to 14.2%. 24 CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues Property liability insurance premiums $ 24,677 $ 23,361 $ 22,197 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges 2,304 2,293 2,230 Net investment income 4,972 4,849 4,790 Realized capital gains and losses 196 (924 ) (352 ) Total revenues 32,149 29,579 28,865 Costs and expenses Property liability insurance claims and claims expense (17,432 ) (17,657 ) (17,532 ) Life and annuity contract benefits (1,851 ) (1,770 ) (1,671 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (1,846 ) (1,764 ) (1,733 ) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (4,058 ) (3,694 ) (3,462 ) Operating costs and expenses (3,001 ) (2,761 ) (2,688 ) Restructuring and related charges (74 ) (119 ) (129 ) Amortization of goodwill (54 ) Interest expense (275 ) (278 ) (248 ) Total costs and expenses (28,537 ) (28,043 ) (27,517 ) (Loss) gain on disposition of operations (41 ) 4 (63 ) Income tax expense (846 ) (65 ) (73 ) Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust(s) (5 ) (10 ) (45 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (15 ) (331 ) (9 ) Net income $ 2,705 $ 1,134 $ 1,158 Property Liability $ 2,521 $ 1,273 $ 926 Allstate Financial 305 (22 ) 363 Corporate and Other (121 ) (117 ) (131 ) Net income $ 2,705 $ 1,134 $ 1,158 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have identified five accounting policies that require us to make assumptions and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates relating to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities are difficult to observe and to characterize. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these 25 estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities. Periodic changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale (other than those accounted for under the cost or equity method) are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party, or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a securitys fair value is performed on a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent when assessing impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near term and long term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1) general economic conditions that are worse than assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuers ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result, the related unrealized loss, net of tax, would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, primarily in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transactions variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. The determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective 26 both at its inception and on an on going basis requires a significant degree of judgment. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. DAC related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, generally for periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. DAC related to traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issue and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies, change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. DAC related to interest sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15 30 years. However, an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used, which results in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. The rate of amortization during the surrender charge period is matched to the assumed pattern of EGP. EGP consists of estimates of the following components: margins from mortality including guaranteed minimum death and income benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses. The most significant assumptions involved in determining EGP are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees, surrender rates, lapse rates, and investment and mortality margins. Our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance after fees is approximately 8%, which is consistent with our pricing assumptions. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from 8%, we create an estimate of performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long term 8% assumption. This process is referred to as a "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the future rates of return after fees projected over the five year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking". For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Property Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to 27 settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date. Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled, and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determinable. We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us yet. The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be plus or minus 4.5%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, estimations of the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean up costs represent insured 28 property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulation. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Life Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when estimating the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. For further discussion of these policies see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A. PROPERTY LIABILITY 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 34, reached a record $25.19 billion during 2003. Compared to last year, premiums written increased 5.3% due to increases in the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners average premiums and the number of policies in force ("PIF"). Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums increased 16.8% and homeowners new business premiums increased 39.4%. The continued implementation of Strategic Risk Management ("SRM"), a multi phase strategy that integrates tier based pricing, underwriting and marketing decisions, resulted in a growing percentage of new business customers who are expected to provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. This improved lifetime value is a result of better loss ratios and higher retention of these customers. Underwriting income for Property Liability was $1.33 billion in 2003 compared to $263 million in 2002, with a combined ratio improvement of 4.3 points to 94.6. These improvements were a result of earned premium growth, favorable claim frequency and lower prior year reserve reestimates, but were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased severity of current year claims for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage. As a result of profit improvement actions, the Ivantage combined ratio improved 8.1 points in 2003 to 101.9 and the number of Ivantage standard auto and homeowners PIF declined 9.7% and 4.5%, respectively compared to December 31, 2002. 29 PROPERTY LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two lines of business, the Allstate brand and Ivantage, and is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Underwriting income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 31, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, restructuring and related charges, and in 2001, the amortization of goodwill, as determined using GAAP. This is one of the measures we use in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 30  Summarized financial data, key operating ratios and a reconciliation of underwriting income (loss) to net income for our Property Liability operations for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

We are seeking, through the utilization of SRM, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We continue to 31 enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. We have also aligned agency management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand by basing certain incentives on profitability, growth and sales of Allstate Financial products. In 2003, we have implemented and will maintain a broader marketing approach throughout the U.S. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brands exclusive agencies and enhancing The Good Hands&reg; Network. The Ivantage business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies. Ivantage includes standard auto and homeowners products with the EncompassSM brand name and non standard auto products with the Deerbrook&reg; brand name. Our strategy for Ivantage focuses on improving profitability for both Encompass and Deerbrook, and growing in select markets, in part by using SRM. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate brand systems has resulted in a different counting process for policies in force. As a result, recorded variances to prior year policies in force and average premium may be subject to some distortion until the integration is completed. The tier based pricing and underwriting used in SRM produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by our pre SRM standard/non standard model that we used and it is designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential for these customers. Our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non standard plans. In some states, we have implemented SRM and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan, which may also be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks. As the implementation of SRM continues, the distinctions between standard and non standard may become less important in certain states, depending upon how SRM is implemented. For this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto, including standard auto and non standard auto. However, we will continue to provide results for standard and non standard auto. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers. For Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners business written under SRM, our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who have lower loss ratios. The impact of SRM on our non standard business has been less pronounced because the impact has been mitigated by the effect of other non standard business initiatives, and as described above, because the implementation of SRM has meant that in some states we write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan. Because the implementation of SRM began in 1999 and has applied primarily to new business written since that time, today it accounts for about 35% of total premiums written. This amount will continue to increase since over 75% of new business is written using SRM rating plans. Another element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth, including managing exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels. Homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period of years. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze events not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing. Accordingly, homeowners products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products. 32 Allstate Protections goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity. Our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes. Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken during 2003 and 2002 will generally be recognized as premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned. % earned after (in millions) 2003 2002 90 days 180 days 270 days 360 days Allstate brand: Standard auto $ 3,481 $ 3,245 74.5 % 98.9 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Non standard auto 497 589 73.2 % 98.3 % 99.6 % 100.0 % Auto 3,978 3,834 74.3 % 98.8 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners 2,736 2,467 43.1 % 75.4 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 1,245 1,144 43.1 % 75.4 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Total Allstate brand 7,959 7,445 58.8 % 87.1 % 96.9 % 100.0 % Ivantage: Standard auto (Encompass) 602 594 44.5 % 76.1 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 45 38 74.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Auto 647 632 46.5 % 77.8 % 94.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners (Encompass) 266 250 43.6 % 75.5 % 94.0 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 67 50 43.7 % 75.7 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Total Ivantage 980 932 45.6 % 77.0 % 94.5 % 100.0 % Total Allstate Protection unearned premiums $ 8,939 $ 8,377 57.3 % 86.0 % 96.7 % 100.0 % 33 A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.

(2)2001 information not available. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2003 when compared to 2002 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. Higher average renewal premiums relate to rate actions taken in the current and prior year and, to a lesser degree, a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos. The increases in new business premiums, PIF and the renewal ratio in 2003 compared to 2002 are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. Declines in 2002 when compared to 2001 were primarily due to administrative and risk management actions taken to improve the standard auto loss ratio. These actions included implementing premium rate increases, down payment requirements and other underwriting changes in several large standard auto premium states. Ivantage standard auto premiums written increased in both 2003 and 2002 compared to the prior years due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy, partially offset by fewer new and renewal policies in force. Increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years. We expect the Ivantage standard auto PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue profitability actions. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for standard auto during 2003. # of States Weighted Average Rate Change (%) Annual Impact of Rate Changes on Premiums Written (%) Allstate brand 25 6.0 4.5 Ivantage (Encompass) 40 8.1 9.2 35 Non standard auto premiums written decreased 12.5% to $2.15 billion in 2003 from $2.45 billion in 2002, following an 8.2% decrease in 2002 from $2.67 billion in 2001.

(2)2001 information not available. Declines in Allstate brand non standard auto new and renewal business premiums during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to a decline in PIF. This decline was due to increases from new business PIF being offset by the declines in PIF related to an inherently low renewal ratio in this business, and to a lesser extent to a shift in writing business previously reported as non standard as standard auto using SRM. The increase in average premium during both years was due primarily to higher average renewal premiums due to rate actions. Ivantage non standard renewal business premiums increased in 2003 due to the re entry of Deerbrook in the non standard market during 2002. Since December 31, 2002, Deerbrook has been writing business in 19 states and consequently more stable trends in new business premiums, PIF and average premium have emerged in 2003 when compared to the prior year. The trends in non standard auto premiums are primarily due to the implementation of programs to address adverse profitability trends for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage. These actions varied by state and included changes to premium down payment requirements, tighter underwriting requirements, rate increases and certain other administrative actions. As a result, our competitive pricing position has declined. These trends are expected to continue, although at a lower rate, as we remain committed to profitable growth and focused on the utilization of SRM.

The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase in 2003 compared to the decrease in 2002 is the result of the increased competitiveness of our underwriting practices, products and rates in the homeowners market. The increases in average premium during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums in both years. Higher average renewal premiums were related to rate actions taken in the current and prior year. Increases in Ivantage homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year. We expect Ivantage PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue actions to improve profitability. 37 The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved during 2003. # of States Weighted Average Rate Change (%) Annual Impact of Rate Changes on Premiums Written (%) Allstate brand 20 1.8 (2) 1.2 Ivantage (Encompass) 40 (1) 11.7 15.3 (1)Includes Washington D.C.

The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity (average cost per claim). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A. 38 Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $497 million during 2002 compared to an underwriting loss of $627 million in 2001. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency, partially offset by increased current year claim severity and prior year reserve reestimates. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2003 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices, while during 2002 it was higher than the relevant medical cost indices. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends. However, auto injury claim severity could offset the success of these programs as was seen in 2002; therefore, we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs and profitability actions such as rate increases. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Body Work price index and the Used Car price index. In 2003 and 2002, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the weighted index. We believe that results can be favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims. Accordingly, we continue to pursue various loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends. However, during 2003 and 2002 the increase in auto physical damage claim severity more than offset the success of these programs. Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, and other economic and environmental factors. In 2003 we experienced a decline in homeowners severity while in 2002 we experienced an increase. Additional losses in 2002 were due to an increase in the volume of mold claims in Texas totaling $326 million. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase, offsetting the success of these programs. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. For example, we have implemented policy language in Texas and the majority of other states limiting payments for mold claims to $5,000 for specified remediation of mold that results from a covered water loss. 39  Loss ratios (the percentage of losses to premiums earned) are a measure of profitability. Loss ratios by product are shown in the following table.

These declines were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 0.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.3 points when compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned in the Allstate brand, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity. Non standard auto loss ratio declined 6.8 points for the Allstate brand and 24.3 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These declines were due to lower claim frequency, favorable reserve reestimates and higher premiums earned in Ivantage, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severities. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 10.6 points, while the Ivantage loss ratio increased 27.9 points. These fluctuations were due to lower claim frequency, offset by lower premiums earned in the Allstate brand and higher losses in Ivantage. Auto loss ratio declined 5.0 points for the Allstate brand and 9.9 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These declines were due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 2.3 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 5.1 points when 40 compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity. Homeowners loss ratio declined 12.6 points for the Allstate brand and increased 1.6 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and lower reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand, including lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims, offset by increased catastrophe losses, higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for Ivantage. Allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in Texas were negligible in 2003 compared to losses of $326 million in 2002 and $184 million in 2001. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 9.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.7 points when compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher mold related claims in the state of Texas. For homeowners, we implemented programs such as market or state specific product designs, rate increases, underwriting and rating changes, discontinuation of specific coverages, specific policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business. Because of the success of these programs we have returned this business to profitability during 2003, although in the future volatility in underwriting results caused by losses from events such as catastrophes may occur. We will continue these programs and introduce others to maintain profitability. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection increased in 2003 compared to 2002 after declining in 2002 from 2001 levels. The increase in 2003 was due to higher agent incentives, marketing expenditures, charitable contributions and employee related expenses. The decline in 2002 was due to various expense management initiatives partially offset by an increase in periodic pension costs. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table. Allstate brand Ivantage 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Amortization of DAC 13.9 13.3 13.2 19.1 19.8 20.2 Other costs and expenses 9.3 8.7 9.4 9.9 12.6 10.7 Amortization of goodwill 0.1 0.6 Restructuring and related charges 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.3 0.1 Total expense ratio 23.5 22.5 23.2 29.3 32.5 31.5 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 23.9 in 2003, 23.3 in 2002 and 23.9 in 2001. The expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is 4 to 5 points lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Ivantage expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates, integration expenses and expenditures for technology. Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was also favorably impacted in 2003 and 2002 by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling $69 million and $99 million, respectively. DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting costs and direct mail 41 solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned. The balance of DAC for each product type at December 31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted. We include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2003, catastrophe losses totaled $1.49 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $731 million in 2002 and $894 million in 2001. Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Actions we have taken to limit our exposure include restricting the amount and location of new business; limiting the availability of certain policy coverages; employing policy brokering; and increasing our participation in catastrophe pools. However, the impact of these actions may be mitigated by the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. We have also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane, tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes. We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States, and the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be California, areas surrounding the New Madrid fault system in the Midwest and faults in and surrounding Seattle, Washington and Charleston, South Carolina. For further disclosure of our participation in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the California Earthquake Authority, which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas, see Notes 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Historical Catastrophe Experience In the last 12 years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property Liability loss ratio was 6.2 pts. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the CEA, FHCF or brokered to a third party. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California 42 earthquakes, on our Property Liability loss ratio was 4.0 during the last 12 years. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last 11 years, excluding losses from Hurricane Andrew, California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes during that period was 15.7 points, with an impact of 16.0 in areas bordering the eastern and gulf coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of 15.3 in all other areas. The question of the impact of global climate change is an on going topic of discussion and so we continue to evaluate credible scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of climate change on our business. Allstate Protection Outlook We expect to see continued premium growth during 2004 as the result of increases in Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners PIF. Increased PIF is related to our pursuit of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S., including underwriting to additional SRM risk tiers, increased advertising and growth in the number and size of Allstate exclusive agencies. Because of our profitable results in 2003, we expect the level of premium rate changes in 2004 will diminish. We do not expect to experience significant premium growth in Ivantage during 2004 while we continue to pursue profitability actions in this business. We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results. We will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for advertising and technology. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost, increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments. DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums written $ 12 $ 7 $ 8 Premiums earned $ 13 $ 10 $ 15 Claims and claims expense (574 ) (233 ) (26 ) Other costs and expenses (10 ) (11 ) (12 ) Restructuring and related charges (1 ) Underwriting loss $ (571 ) $ (234 ) $ (24 ) During 2003, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reserve increases for asbestos totaling $514 million. Our annual "ground up" review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures resulted in an increase in asbestos reserves totaling $442 million. During the year, asbestos reserves were also increased $34 million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy, and by $38 million for an excess insurance policyholder who 43 submitted new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated, and therefore unexpected, coverage years. Reserves for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable and bad debts were increased by $26 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $23 million, $39 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures, resulting in an increase in reserves totaling $231 million, including increases for asbestos of $121 million, environmental of $26 million, other discontinued lines of $45 million, and costs of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures of $39 million. See the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves discussion for a more detailed description of our reserving practices. Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These potential losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information becoming known relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. PROPERTY LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 1.3% in 2003 when compared to last year, after decreasing 5.1% in 2002 when compared to 2001. In 2003, the increase was due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships, mostly offset by lower portfolio yields. In 2002, the decrease was due to lower portfolio yields and lower income from partnership interests, partially offset by higher portfolio balances due to positive cash flows from operations and investment activities. During 2002, we sold approximately $1 billion of the Property Liability equity securities portfolio. The proceeds of this sale were invested in fixed income securities, which generated higher net investment income. The following table presents the average pre tax investment yields(1) for the year ended December 31. 2003 2002 2001 Fixed income securities: tax exempt 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 % Fixed income securities: tax exempt equivalent 7.8 8.0 8.1 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.5 6.5 6.6 Equity securities 4.4 3.9 5.4 Mortgage loans 7.7 5.8 7.0 Total portfolio 5.3 5.6 6.0 (1)Pre tax yield is calculated as annualized investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the beginning and end of period investment balances. Amortized cost basis is used to calculate the average investment balance for fixed income securities. 44 Net realized capital gains and losses were $192 million in 2003 compared to ($314) million in 2002 and ($83) million in 2001. The following table presents the factors driving the net realized capital gains and losses results.

Investment Outlook The Property Liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases. Cash flows available for investment can be impacted by volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation. The amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the amount of Property Liability net investment income. Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments, calls and maturities, and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate. PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date. Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three year or two year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. 45 Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate. Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates. Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December 31, 2003, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $100 million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $100 million. For a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 46% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 14% in the third year, 9% in the fourth year, and the remaining 11% thereafter. 46  The table below shows total net reserves as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 for Allstate brand, Ivantage and Discontinued Lines and Coverages lines of business.

Auto reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to increasing severity trends for automobile repair and medical costs of $55 million for Ivantage operations and $17 million for Canadian operations, partially offset by reduced reserve 47 reestimates for the Allstate brand. In 2001, the favorable impact of Allstate brand auto reserve reestimates was partially offset by a greater than expected volume of late reported, unusual, weather related losses; adverse results of litigation; and increased reestimates of losses reported in prior years for the Ivantage and Canadian businesses. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to claim severity and late reported losses that were greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates. This resulted in reserve reestimates including $78 million related to IBNR, $95 million related to claim severity and $169 million related to mold claims in Texas. In addition, reserves were increased $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In March 2002, a new Texas homeowner policy form was implemented that restricted mold coverage from what had been provided by a previous broad state mandated policy form. As a result, coverage provided and the incidence of losses for mold diminished in the second half of the year. Reserve reestimates in 2003 and 2002 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of Californias Senate Bill 1899 in 1999. Increased homeowner reserve reestimates in 2001 were primarily due to $118 million of greater late reported unusual weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which was reported in the year 2001, increases to severity of homeowners losses reported in prior years totaling $172 million, and $125 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reserve reestimates in 2001 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of Californias Senate Bill 1899 in 1999. Other lines reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002, and 2001 were primarily the result of different claim severity development than anticipated in previous estimates. 48 Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. The Allstate brand experienced $386 million of unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2002. This was primarily due to $338 million of homeowners reestimates resulting from claim severity development and late reported losses that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates, including $169 million related to mold claims in Texas and $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were about $48 million for the year, of which $20 million was for Canadian business reserves. These reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for some of the small non auto products. Reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand claims in 2001 included a $348 million increase in the 2000 accident year losses offset by $122 million of net favorable reestimates for all prior years. Approximately $197 million of unfavorable reestimates for 2000 accident year losses was the result of unusually bad weather experienced at year end 2000, coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims. The remainder of the 2000 accident year loss reestimate was primarily attributable to increased severity for homeowner losses including mold related losses in Texas. For accident years prior to 2000, the net reestimate of $122 million included $125 million of adverse reestimates for Northridge related losses and $105 million of other litigation related adverse reestimates, offset by favorable reestimates. The preceding trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. 50 The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Reserve reestimates $ 209 $ (386 ) $ (226 ) Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) 1,941 681 (298 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting income (loss) 10.8 % (56.7 )% (75.8 )% Ivantage Reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were related to higher than anticipated claim settlement costs. In 2001, adverse reestimates also resulted from unusually bad weather experienced at year end 2000 coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims. The impact of these reestimates on the Ivantage underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Reserve reestimates $ (36 ) $ (68 ) $ (90 ) Ivantage underwriting (loss) income (38 ) (184 ) (329 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (94.7 )% (37.0 )% (27.4 )% Discontinued Lines and Coverages We conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders. Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2003 and 2001, and for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses in 2002. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 635 $ 520 $ 675 $ 121 $ 642 $ 94 Environmental Claims 304 2 343 26 429 (45 ) Other Discontinued Lines 491 52 476 84 553 (23 ) Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 1,430 $ 574 $ 1,494 $ 231 $ 1,624 $ 26 Underwriting (loss) income (571 ) (234 ) (24 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (100.5 )% (98.7 )% (108.3 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2003, totaling $520 million, were primarily for products related coverage. This increase essentially was a result of more claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business. This trend is consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry. We believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. 51 In 2002, asbestos reserves were increased by $121 million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures. Pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased to a minor extent. Reserve reestimates also included $45 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off and $39 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. In 2001, our annual review resulted in a $94 million reestimate of asbestos reserves due to increased emergence of reported losses. This was partially offset by a $45 million favorable reestimate of environmental reserves and $23 million of favorable reestimates in other discontinued lines due to improving loss emergence trends in these areas. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature. Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business. Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro rata coverage. Liability for actual and potential asbestos losses has caused a number of companies to file for bankruptcy protection. Of 63 companies that filed for bankruptcy as a result of significant asbestos exposure, on a direct (both primary and excess) insurance basis, we: Did not insure 43 Settled with 12 Reserved to excess insurance policy limits on 4 Reserved to maximum mutual agreed upon exposure on 1 52 Appropriately reserved for the remaining 3 Although we do not believe a greater exposure is probable for the remaining 3, our maximum additional exposure to full policy limits for the remaining 3 in the aggregate is $27 million, after tax. Reserves related to asbestos manufacturers in bankruptcy, whose claims are still in the process of resolution, are established based on claims that have occurred and other related information. The claim resolution process in these bankruptcies is lengthy and involves, among other factors, filing notices of claim by all current claimants, evaluating pre petition and post petition claims, negotiations among the various creditor groups and the debtors and, if necessary, evidentiary hearings by the bankruptcy court. We will continue to monitor the relevant bankruptcies. Our exposure, if any, to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers, including any currently in bankruptcy, would also arise if assumed reinsurance was written for an insurer providing insurance protection to a major asbestos manufacturer, and then only in proportion to our participation share. We assess our potential liability to each of our reinsurance programs and adjust reserves accordingly based on our knowledge of the losses of each reinsured exposure. Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country. The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 904 $ 635 $ 929 $ 675 $ 871 $ 642 Incurred claims and claims expense 800 520 180 121 158 94 Claims and claims expense paid (121 ) (76 ) (205 ) (161 ) (100 ) (61 ) Ending reserves $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 $ 929 $ 675 Annual survival ratio 13.1 14.2 4.4 3.9 9.3 11.1 3 year survival ratio 11.1 10.9 5.3 5.1 7.0 7.6 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 393 $ 304 $ 444 $ 343 $ 559 $ 429 Incurred claims and claims expense 2 34 26 (60 ) (45 ) Claims and claims expense paid (78 ) (49 ) (85 ) (65 ) (55 ) (41 ) Ending reserves $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 $ 444 $ 343 Annual survival ratio 4.0 5.2 4.6 4.7 8.1 8.4 3 year survival ratio 4.3 5.0 5.4 5.1 6.7 6.7 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 9.5 10.7 4.5 4.2 8.9 10.0 3 year survival ratio 8.8 8.9 5.3 5.1 6.9 7.3 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 59.9 % 53.5 % 58.4 % 53  The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. In 2003, the asbestos survival ratios increased (improved) due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. The environmental survival ratios decreased slightly due to a lower reserve balance. In 2002, both the asbestos and environmental survival ratios declined due to an increase in claims paid and reduced reserve levels, primarily due to commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn, caused increased claim payments and reduced reserve levels. The total commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2003, 2002 and 2001 excluding these commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table. 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 54 $ 33 $ 118 $ 102 $ 27 $ 18 Annual survival ratio 22.7 24.2 9.5 10.3 11.3 14.7 3 year survival ratio 21.9 22.2 11.0 12.5 11.8 15.4 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 42 $ 24 $ 29 $ 22 $ 23 $ 16 Annual survival ratio 8.4 10.0 6.6 6.9 13.7 13.7 3 year survival ratio 7.7 8.4 9.7 9.5 13.0 13.1 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 96 $ 57 $ 147 $ 124 $ 50 $ 34 Annual survival ratio 17.7 19.0 8.4 8.9 12.0 14.3 3 year survival ratio 16.7 16.9 10.6 11.3 12.2 14.5 Our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be a more representative, prospective measure of current reserve adequacy than other survival ratio calculations. Now at 22.2 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2003, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2003 would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately $31 million. 54 Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 (in millions) Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves(1) % of Reserves(1) Active Policy holders Net Reserves(1) % of Reserves(1) Direct policyholders: Primary 52 $ 28 3 % 40 $ 16 2 % 39 $ 12 2 % Excess 286 201 19 240 87 14 223 75 11 Total 338 229 22 % 280 103 16 % 262 87 13 % Assumed reinsurance 191 17 173 27 168 25 IBNR claims 659 61 359 57 421 62 Total net reserves $ 1,079 100 % $ 635 100 % $ 676 100 % Total reserve additions $ 514 (2) $ 121 $ 94 (1)To conform to the current year presentation, $8 million of asbestos reserves at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 have been reclassified from direct excess insurance policyholders to direct primary insurance policyholders. (2)Excludes a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. During the last three years, 190 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 104 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 86 during the period. The 86 increase comprised 58 from 2003, 18 from 2002 and 10 from 2001. The increase of 58 from 2003 included 85 new policyholders reporting new claims and 27 policyholders claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2003, totaled $514 million and included the following factors: Direct primary insurance net reserves increased by $12 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis. Direct excess insurance net reserves increased by $114 million for policyholders with existing active claims. The increase in existing active claims was attributable to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds. Assumed reinsurance net reserves increased by $18 million for increased cessions as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table. Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2002 Year ended December 31, 2001 New Claims(1) 265 197 182 (1)New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies. IBNR net reserves increased by $300 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2003 IBNR represented 61.1% of total asbestos reserves, 4 points higher than at December 31, 2002. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies. 55 Our non products case reserves represent approximately 4.7% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure. For environmental exposures a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Environmental loss emergence in 2002 was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other direct losses. In past years environmental reestimates have been favorable. Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table. Number of Claims 2003 2002 2001 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 6,900 6,426 6,004 New 2,267 1,165 967 Total closed (957 ) (691 ) (545 ) Pending, end of year 8,210 6,900 6,426 Closed without payment 594 444 281 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 7,352 8,486 8,744 New 954 845 1,028 Total closed (2,206 ) (1,979 ) (1,286 ) Pending, end of year 6,100 7,352 8,486 Closed without payment 1,776 1,442 737 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Other mass torts $ 234 $ 236 $ 228 Workers compensation 132 137 149 Commercial and other 135 118 99 Other discontinued lines $ 501 $ 491 $ 476 Other mass torts describes excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued primary, excess and reinsurance commercial 56 insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures. We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2004, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves. Property Liability Reinsurance Ceded We participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including both voluntary and mandatory industry pools and facilities, and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts. Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Mandatory industry pools and facilities $ 885 $ 935 $ 812 $ 838 Asbestos and environmental 1,898 1,297 636 423 Other 14,931 14,458 456 540 Total Property Liability $ 17,714 $ 16,690 $ 1,904 $ 1,801 We purchase reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $101 million and $85 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. 57 The ten largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

We enter into certain inter company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2003 HIGHLIGHTS Allstate Financial revenues increased 9.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was primarily due to lower net capital losses in 2003. Excluding net capital losses, revenues increased 2.3% in 2003 to $5.54 billion primarily due to increased net investment income. Net income increased to $305 million in 2003 from a net loss of $22 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to the 2002 impact of the change in accounting principle for goodwill that resulted in a charge of $283 million, after tax, and lower net realized capital losses in 2003, partly offset by higher income tax expense and an increased loss on disposition of operations. Investments, including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% to $76.32 billion due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year. Contractholder funds deposits totaled $10.63 billion for 2003 compared to $9.52 billion in 2002. The increase of $1.11 billion was primarily attributable to fixed annuity and institutional product deposits. 58 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a leading provider of life insurance, annuities and other financial services to a broad spectrum of individual and institutional customers.

Summarized financial data for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 Net investment income 3,233 3,121 2,962 Realized capital gains and losses (85 ) (432 ) (221 ) Total revenues 5,452 4,982 4,971 Costs and expenses Contract benefits (1,851 ) (1,770 ) (1,671 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (1,846 ) (1,764 ) (1,733 ) Amortization of DAC (538 ) (478 ) (402 ) Operating costs and expenses (672 ) (649 ) (567 ) Amortization of goodwill (29 ) Restructuring and related charges (7 ) (2 ) (8 ) Total costs and expenses (4,914 ) (4,663 ) (4,410 ) Loss on disposition of operations (46 ) (6 ) Income tax expense (170 ) (52 ) (192 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (17 ) (283 ) (6 ) Net income (loss) $ 305 $ (22 ) $ 363 Investments $ 62,895 $ 55,264 $ 46,066 Separate Accounts assets 13,425 11,125 13,587 Investments, including Separate Accounts assets $ 76,320 $ 66,389 $ 59,653 59 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life, immediate annuities with life contingencies and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life products, variable annuities, fixed annuities and other investment products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues. The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums Traditional life $ 388 $ 403 $ 446 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 413 416 333 Accident, health and other 564 552 566 Total premiums 1,365 1,371 1,345 Contract charges Interest sensitive life 618 597 558 Fixed annuities 37 32 36 Variable annuities 206 212 217 Institutional products 8 6 5 Accident, health and other 70 75 69 Total contract charges 939 922 885 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 319 $ 278 $ 252 Specialized brokers 390 415 332 Independent agents 373 351 354 Direct marketing 283 327 407 Total premiums 1,365 1,371 1,345 Contract charges Allstate agencies 440 429 381 Specialized brokers 30 25 24 Independent agents 279 271 274 Financial institutions and broker/dealers 187 197 206 Direct marketing 3 Total contract charges 939 922 885 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,304 $ 2,293 $ 2,230 Total premiums decreased 0.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of our direct response business, lower traditional life and immediate annuity premium, partially offset by higher premiums from accident, health and other products sold through the workplace. The decline in premiums from our direct response business reflects management actions over the past two years to discontinue this business. The decline in traditional life premium reflects a shift in product sales from traditional whole life policies to term insurance, which has lower premiums 60 and where we utilize more ceded reinsurance. The decline in immediate annuities with life contingencies was a result of underwriting actions to reduce the size of certain types of individual contracts sold in 2003. Total premiums were $1.37 billion in 2002 compared to $1.35 billion in 2001. The increase was due to increases in immediate annuities with life contingencies, partially offset by declines in traditional life, accident, health and other insurance products. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily related to the implementation of a reinsurance agreement on January 1, 2002 that ceded our direct response credit life insurance products and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product sales from traditional whole life insurance to term. Contract charges increased 1.8% to $939 million in 2003 compared to $922 million in 2002. Contract charges were consistent with the prior year as higher interest sensitive life contract charges resulting from in force business growth were partially offset by lower variable annuity contract charges, which resulted from lower average variable annuity account balances during the period. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 166 basis points in 2003 from 163 basis points in 2002 as a result of increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders. Contract charges increased 4.2% in 2002 compared to 2001 as contract charges on new sales of interest sensitive life products more than offset a decline from variable annuities. Variable annuity contract charges declined due to lower average account values during 2002 as poor equity market performance more than offset growth from deposits during the year. Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual products, such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, net bank deposits and institutional products, such as funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 40,751 $ 33,560 $ 28,870 Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 5,266 4,971 3,160 Institutional products 2,713 1,873 2,692 Interest sensitive life 1,074 964 925 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 893 1,212 1,194 Bank and other deposits 681 498 Total deposits 10,627 9,518 7,971 Interest credited 1,846 1,764 1,733 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Benefits and withdrawals (3,233 ) (2,522 ) (2,548 ) Maturities of institutional products (2,163 ) (1,056 ) (1,192 ) Contract charges (622 ) (567 ) (541 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (416 ) (474 ) (1,024 ) Fair value adjustments for institutional products 131 363 95 Other adjustments 150 165 196 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (6,153 ) (4,091 ) (5,014 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 47,071 $ 40,751 $ 33,560 61  Contractholder funds deposits increased 11.7% in 2003 compared to 2002, and average contractholder funds increased 18.2% in 2003 compared to 2002, due to significant increases in institutional product and fixed annuity deposits. Fixed annuity deposits increased 5.9% over 2002 due to competitive pricing and our decision to maintain a market presence despite a challenging interest rate environment. Fixed annuity deposits through our financial institutions distribution channel grew 40.0% in 2003 compared to 2002. This growth was a result of expanded relationships and consumers attraction to fixed rate contracts with shorter term rate guarantees due to volatile equity markets and the uncertainty of a low interest rate environment. This growth was partially offset by a decline in fixed annuities sold through our independent agencies distribution channel where longer term interest rate guarantees are generally favored. As a result of the low interest rate environment during 2003, we introduced fixed annuity contracts with lower guaranteed crediting rates. Institutional products deposits increased 44.8% largely due to our assessment of market opportunities. Benefits and withdrawals increased $711 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Benefits and withdrawals for 2003 represent 7.9% of the beginning of period contractholder funds balance, a slight increase compared to 7.5% in 2002. The increase reflects the aging of our in force contracts as the actual surrenders and withdrawals compared favorably to our expectations. Institutional product maturities increased $1.11 billion in 2003 as an increasing number of contracts issued in prior years reached their stated maturity dates. $1.91 billion is scheduled to mature in 2004. Contractholder funds deposits increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to significant increases in fixed annuity deposits and bank and other deposits, partially offset by a decline in institutional products. Fixed annuity deposits increased 57.3% over 2001 due to competitive pricing and the introduction of the Allstate&reg; Treasury Linked Annuity, which generated $761 million of deposits in 2002. Institutional deposits decreased 30.4% in 2002, as market conditions at times during the year would not allow us to achieve acceptable pricing returns. Average contractholder funds increased 19.0% in 2002 compared to 2001. Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related legally segregated separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 11,125 $ 13,587 $ 15,298 Variable annuity and life deposits 2,284 2,432 2,932 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (893 ) (1,212 ) (1,194 ) Net deposits 1,391 1,220 1,738 Investment results 2,393 (2,167 ) (2,262 ) Contract charges (220 ) (212 ) (190 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 416 474 1,024 Surrenders and benefits (1,680 ) (1,777 ) (2,021 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 13,425 $ 11,125 $ 13,587 Separate accounts liabilities increased $2.30 billion during 2003 compared to 2002 reflecting a significant improvement in investment results and net deposits. The increase in variable annuity net deposits resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and the introduction of the Allstate&reg; Advisor variable annuity product. Allstate Advisor is a multi manager variable annuity that offers funds from four mutual fund families. In volatile and uncertain equity markets, variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate 62 investment option. This allows contractholders to transfer funds to separate accounts equity investment funds over time and to purchase their equity investment fund shares at multiple fund price levels. This is commonly referred to as dollar cost averaging. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to the fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds. Separate accounts liabilities decreased $2.46 billion during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting the significant decline in equity markets and the resulting substantial decrease in variable annuity net deposits during the year. Net investment income increased 3.6% in 2003 compared to 2002 and 5.4% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increases were due to higher portfolio balances during the year as investment income on positive cash flows from product sales and deposits was mostly offset by lower portfolio yields. Investment balances as of December 31, 2003, excluding unrealized net capital gains, increased 14.5% from December 31, 2002 and increased 17.1% as of December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001. The lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average. During 2003 we reclassified periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non hedge" for accounting purposes, to realized capital gains and losses so that they are reported consistently with the corresponding fair value adjustments on these instruments. The reclassifications decreased net investment income $22 million, $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 63 Net income analysis is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Investment margin Life insurance $ 234 $ 249 $ 293 Annuities 546 505 408 Institutional products 107 107 77 Bank and other 9 8 Total investment margin 896 869 778 Mortality margin Life insurance 658 666 652 Annuities (112 ) (67 ) (56 ) Total mortality margin 546 599 596 Maintenance charges 342 342 343 Surrender charges 79 75 77 Gross margin 1,863 1,885 1,794 Amortization of DAC (492 ) (476 ) (385 ) Operating costs and expenses (672 ) (649 ) (567 ) Amortization of goodwill (29 ) Restructuring and related charges (7 ) (2 ) (8 ) Income tax expense (243 ) (202 ) (278 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax (53 ) (287 ) (143 ) DAC amortization expense on realized capital gains and losses, after tax (30 ) (1 ) (11 ) Reclassification of periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, after tax (15 ) (3 ) (4 ) Loss on disposition of operations, after tax (29 ) (4 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (17 ) (283 ) (6 ) Net income (loss) $ 305 $ (22 ) $ 363 Investment margin represents the excess of investment income earned over interest credited to policyholders and contractholders and interest expense. Investment margin includes periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non hedge" for accounting purposes that are included in realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment margin increased 3.1% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a 15.5% increase in contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates where possible, partially offset by the decline in the portfolio yield of fixed income securities. For fixed annuities and life products for which we have the ability to modify crediting rates, the weighted average interest crediting rate was approximately 70 and 140 basis points above the long term underlying guaranteed rate at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The yield decline on the assets that support our capital, traditional life or other products for which the Company does not have the ability to modify crediting rates also had a significant negative impact on the investment margin during the year. The investment margin increased 11.7% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a 21.4% increase in contractholder funds. The impact of this growth was partially offset by a decline in portfolio yields from lower market interest rates affecting the yield on the investment of cash flows from operations and investments, and a shift to sales of investment products with lower 64 investment margins, such as market value adjusted annuities ("MVAA") and funding agreements that have lower capital requirements and cash flow variability. The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2003, 2002 and 2001. Weighted Average Investment Yield Weighted Average Interest Crediting Rate Weighted Average Investment Spreads 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Interest sensitive life 6.9 % 7.3 % 7.6 % 4.9 % 5.1 % 5.3 % 2.0 % 2.2 % 2.3 % Fixed annuities deferred 6.4 7.1 7.3 4.6 5.2 5.4 1.8 1.9 1.9 Fixed annuities immediate 7.9 8.2 8.5 7.1 7.2 7.5 0.8 1.0 1.0 Institutional 3.5 4.3 6.1 2.5 3.4 5.2 1.0 0.9 0.9 Investments supporting capital, traditional life and other products 6.2 6.9 7.7 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A The following table summarizes the liabilities as of December 31 for these contracts and policies. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Interest sensitive life $ 7,275 $ 6,802 $ 6,290 Fixed annuities deferred 25,848 21,383 17,411 Fixed annuities immediate 10,099 9,381 8,241 Institutional 9,380 8,613 7,517 52,602 46,179 39,459 Life contingent contracts 3,747 3,395 2,632 Allstate Bank 806 610 FAS 133 market value adjustment 559 426 69 Ceded reserves and other 377 397 534 Total contractholder funds and reserve for life contingent contract benefits $ 58,091 $ 51,007 $ 42,694 Mortality margin, which represents premiums and cost of insurance contract charges less related policy benefits was $546 million in 2003, reflecting a $53 million or 8.8% decline compared to 2002. An increase in guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuity contracts in 2003 compared to 2002 represents $30 million of the $53 million decline. The remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of 2003, poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non life credit insurance, partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest sensitive life and accident and health products sold through the workplace. In 2003, GMDB payments were $83 million, net of reinsurance, hedging results and other contractual arrangements ("net GMDB payments"), compared to $53 million and $31 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. While 2003 net GMDB payments were higher than in 2002, improved equity market performance during 2003 resulted in sequential quarterly reductions in gross GMDB payments. Direct response non life credit insurance generated a mortality margin of $2 million and $7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The mortality margin was comparable in 2002 and 2001 as increased contract charges from interest sensitive life growth were offset by increased policy benefits and net GMDB payments. Amortization of DAC increased 3.4% during 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to in force business growth, partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC increased 23.6% in 2002 compared 65 to 2001, primarily due to higher DAC unlocking and growth of business in force. Net DAC unlocking totaled $89 million, $94 million and $2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of DAC assumptions in the first quarter of 2003 and concluded that, due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the U.S. economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment, it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity fund returns would revert to the expected long term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model. As a result, we unlocked the DAC assumptions for all investment products, including variable and fixed annuities, and interest sensitive life products, to be consistent across all product lines. The 2003 unlocking of DAC assumptions included $124 million for variable annuities, partially offset by the effect of favorable investment margins on fixed annuities and favorable persistency on interest sensitive life products. The most significant assumption change involved resetting the variable annuity reversion to the mean calculation, such that future equity market performance during the five year reversion period was reduced from 13.25% after fees to the long term assumed return of 8% after fees. The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables. (in millions) Beginning balance December 31, 2002 Acquisition costs deferred Amortization charged to income Amortization (acceleration) deceleration charged to income(1) Effect of unrealized capital gains and losses Ending balance December 31, 2003 Traditional life $ 709 $ 83 $ (72 ) $ $ $ 720 Interest sensitive life 1,261 193 (136 ) 16 21 1,355 Variable annuities 834 143 (36 ) (124 ) (51 ) 766 Investment contracts 190 321 (141 ) 19 64 453 Accident, health and other 211 76 (64 ) 223 Total $ 3,205 $ 816 $ (449 ) $ (89 ) $ 34 $ 3,517 Beginning balance December 31, 2001 Acquisition costs deferred Amortization charged to income Amortization (acceleration) deceleration charged to income(1) Effect of unrealized capital gains and losses Ending balance December 31, 2002 Traditional life $ 694 $ 92 $ (77 ) $ $ $ 709 Interest sensitive life 1,274 196 (140 ) (6 ) (63 ) 1,261 Variable annuities 858 116 (25 ) (120 ) 5 834 Investment contracts 272 252 (79 ) 32 (287 ) 190 Accident, health and other 188 86 (63 ) 211 Total $ 3,286 $ 742 $ (384 ) $ (94 ) $ (345 ) $ 3,205 (1)Included as a component of Amortization of DAC on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe that as a result of the DAC unlocking performed in 2003, the variable annuity DAC asset is appropriately valued for the current economic environment. With moderate movements in the equity markets, the likelihood of future DAC unlocking is substantially reduced since the projected return in the mean reversion period is no longer at the maximum. 66 Operating costs and expenses increased 3.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Non deferrable acquisition costs $ 170 $ 139 $ 118 Other operating costs and expenses 502 510 449 Total operating costs and expenses $ 672 $ 649 $ 567 The increase in total operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher non deferrable acquisition costs such as renewal and annual trail commissions. Other operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 decreased as higher employee benefit and technology related costs were more than offset by lower litigation expense. Total operating costs and expenses increased 14.5% during 2002 compared to 2001 due to non deferrable acquisition costs, investments in technology, expansion of the workplace distribution channel, increased employee related benefits, advertising costs and litigation expenses. In 2003 and 2002, operating costs and expenses also include the Allstate Bank. Adjustments to prior year tax liabilities resulted in net unfavorable adjustments to net income of $11 million in 2003 compared with net favorable adjustments of $42 million in 2002.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. For life insurance policies, depending upon the issue year and product, we may cede 90%, 80% or 60% of the mortality risk. As of December 31, 2003, 44% of our face amount of life insurance in force is reinsured. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on our long term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. 67 The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life insurance policy benefits at December 31, are summarized in the following table. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2003 2002 Life insurance $ 836 $ 751 Long term care 180 111 Other 201 220 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,217 $ 1,082 Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves. Developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been recent consolidation activity between reinsurers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. Additionally, one of our primary reinsurers has announced its intention to no longer assume life reinsurance risks. As a result, we plan to increase our retention of term life insurance and evaluate alternative reinsurance structures. Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by the reinsurers Standard & Poors financial strength ratings as of December 31, are shown in the following table. In certain cases, these ratings refer to the financial strength of the affiliated group or parent company of the reinsurer. 2003 2002 (in millions) Reinsurance Recoverable % Reinsurance Recoverable % AAA $ 22 1.8 % $ 3 0.3 % AA+ 80 7.4 AA 410 33.7 391 36.1 AA 271 22.3 372 34.4 A+ 304 25.0 180 16.6 A 1 0.1 2 0.2 A 167 13.7 2 0.2 Other 42 3.4 52 4.8 Total $ 1,217 100 % $ 1,082 100 % We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. At December 31, 2003, there were no reinsurance recoverable amounts that were greater than 60 days past due and we did not have an allowance established for them. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended December 31, 2003. We enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 68 Allstate Financial Outlook Our ability to grow our investment margin is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates, and growing the amount of business in force. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, we expect a reduction in our investment yields. The amount in which these lower yields will reduce our investment margin is contingent on our ability to lower interest crediting rates on certain interest sensitive products, which could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Also, a significant amount of our invested assets are used to support our capital and non interest sensitive products, which do not provide this offsetting opportunity. As a result, we expect growth in our investment margin from net new business, which also fluctuates in relation to the interest rate environment, to be partially offset by compression in our in force investment spreads. If equity markets perform at historical norms, we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue and lower net GMDB payments on our in force business. However, improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity markets performance creates a proportional increase or decrease in variable annuity amortization of DAC, which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. To eliminate some of these market concerns, we are expecting to retain more of our mortality risk in 2004. This change will have a diminutive effect on our net income in the short term, but will provide the foundation to drive increased long term growth in our life insurance business. Our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk, which will require increased statutory capital. INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolio. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. Overview and Strategy The investment strategy for the Property Liability portfolio emphasizes safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. The method for achieving this goal is based on a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerance as well as the risk/return parameters of various asset classes. This modeling, along with duration and liquidity considerations, is the guide for our asset allocation. On a tactical basis, decisions are made based on analysis of relative value opportunities across markets. Performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. Reviews of the portfolio are conducted regularly, including a portfolio monitoring process that identifies securities that are impaired on an other than temporary basis. For more information see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. This approach to balancing total return management with income needs and risk tolerances has produced competitive returns over time. 69  The investment strategy for Allstate Financial is also based upon a strategic asset allocation framework that takes into account the need to manage the portfolio on a risk adjusted spread basis for the underlying contract liabilities and to maximize return on retained capital. Generally, a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling is used to achieve a desired asset mix in the management of the portfolio. The strategic asset allocation model portfolio is the primary basis for setting annual asset allocation targets with respect to interest sensitive, illiquid and credit asset allocations as well as limitations with respect to overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. On a tactical basis, decisions are made on an option adjusted relative value basis staying within the constraints of the strategic asset allocation framework. We believe asset spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform on a long term basis and by using trading to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. Total return measurement is used on a selective basis where the asset risks are significant (e.g., high yield fixed income securities, convertible bonds). We expect that by employing this strategy we will minimize interest rate market impacts on investment income and provide sustainable investment income over time. Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2003 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information. Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Total (in millions) Percent to total Percent to total Percent to total Percent to total Fixed income securities(1) $ 31,829 84.1 % $ 53,748 85.5 % $ 2,164 93.0 % $ 87,741 85.1% Equity securities 5,122 13.5 165 0.2 1 5,288 5.1 Mortgage loans 64 0.2 6,475 10.3 6,539 6.3 Short term 840 2.2 815 1.3 160 6.9 1,815 1.8 Other 4 1,692 2.7 2 0.1 1,698 1.7 Total $ 37,859 100.0 % $ 62,895 100.0 % $ 2,327 100.0 % $ 103,081 100.0% (1)Fixed income securities are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these securities was $30.08 billion, $50.49 billion and $2.04 billion for Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively. Total investments increased to $103.08 billion at December 31, 2003 from $90.65 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities, increased unrealized gains on equity securities, assets consolidated pursuant to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs. Property Liability investments were $37.86 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $34.25 billion at December 31, 2002, due to positive cash flows from operations and increased unrealized gains on equity securities, partially offset by dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation. Allstate Financial investments increased to $62.90 billion at December 31, 2003, from $55.26 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in Allstate Financial investments was primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs. Corporate and Other investments increased to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of two variable interest entities ("VIEs") used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under FIN 46. For further disclosure of this consolidation, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A. 70 Total investment balances related to collateral, primarily due to securities lending, increased to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2003, from $2.98 billion at December 31, 2002. We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. The following table shows the investment portfolio, and the sources of its fair value, at December 31, 2003. Investments Derivative Contracts (in millions) Fair Value Percent to total Fair Value Value based on independent market quotations $ 81,269 78.8 % $ (1 ) Value based on models and other valuation methods 12,643 12.3 548 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 9,169 8.9 Total $ 103,081 100.0 % $ 547 Fixed Income Securities See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income securities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. U.S. government and agencies of the U.S. government securities were all rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $24.81 billion and 95.9% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Approximately 59.0% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by 7 bond insurers and accordingly have a rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2003 consisted of approximately 3,300 issues from approximately 2,300 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was less than 1.1% of the municipal bond portfolio. The ultimate obligors of approximately 12% of the municipal bond portfolio were corporate entities. Corporate bonds totaled $36.49 billion and 87.1% were rated as investment grade at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the fixed income securities portfolio contained $15.84 billion of privately placed corporate obligations or 43.4% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $13.08 billion at December 31, 2002. The benefits of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds on many bonds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk and fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2003, 81.5% of the privately placed securities were rated as investment grade. Foreign government securities totaled $2.47 billion and 94.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Mortgage backed securities ("MBS") totaled $14.64 billion at December 31, 2003. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is also subject to 71 interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying mortgages. We attempt to limit interest rate risk on these securities by investing a portion of the portfolio in securities that provide prepayment protection. At December 31, 2003, approximately 29.3% of the MBS portfolio was invested in planned amortization class bonds or the equivalent. Though these security types offer greater relative prepayment protection than other MBS securities, the degree of protection has been limited in this interest rate environment. Based on market conditions and potential changes in portfolio management objectives, the value of this protection and the significance of these holdings relative to the entire portfolio may be reduced in future periods. Asset backed securities ("ABS") totaled $5.10 billion at December 31, 2003. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is mitigated by monitoring the performance of the collateral. Approximately 61.0% of the ABS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. The ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying assets. Approximately 33.0% of the ABS portfolio is invested in securitized credit card receivables. The remainder of the portfolio is primarily backed by securitized home equity, manufactured housing or auto loans. At December 31, 2003, 93.2% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a Moodys equivalent rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa; an S&P equivalent rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB; or a comparable internal rating. The following table summarizes the credit quality of the fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2003. Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Total NAIC Rating Moodys, S&P or Equivalent Fair Value Percent to total Fair Value Percent to total Fair Value Percent to total Fair Value Percent to total (in millions) 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ 27,363 86.0 % $ 33,902 63.1 % $ 1,372 63.4 % $ 62,637 71.4 % 2 Baa 2,917 9.2 16,100 29.9 75 3.5 19,092 21.8 3 Ba 678 2.1 2,305 4.3 304 14.0 3,287 3.7 4 B 510 1.6 1,148 2.1 305 14.1 1,963 2.2 5 Caa or lower 295 0.9 196 0.4 17 0.8 508 0.6 6 In or near default 66 0.2 97 0.2 91 4.2 254 0.3 Total $ 31,829 100.0 % $ 53,748 100.0 % $ 2,164 100.0 % $ 87,741 100.0 % Equity Securities Equity securities include common and non redeemable preferred stocks, real estate investment trust equity investments and limited partnership investments. The equity securities portfolio was $5.29 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $3.68 billion in 2002. The increase is attributable to higher unrealized net capital gains during 2003 and new money from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.28 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $562 million at December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses totaled $18 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $102 million at December 31, 2002. Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining that they are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December 31, 2003 were $6.40 billion, an increase of $906 million 72 or 16.5% since December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the corporate fixed income portfolios and were comprised of securities in the following sectors. Gross unrealized At December 31, 2003 Amortized cost Fair value Gains Losses (in millions) Corporate: Consumer goods (cyclical and non cyclical) $ 6,337 $ 374 $ (35 ) $ 6,676 Public utilities 4,996 564 (7 ) 5,553 Banking 4,701 320 (42 ) 4,979 Capital goods 3,534 204 (19 ) 3,719 Communications 3,118 228 (7 ) 3,339 Basic industry 3,012 162 (28 ) 3,146 Financial services 2,926 179 (11 ) 3,094 Energy 2,177 124 (11 ) 2,290 Transportation 1,529 113 (34 ) 1,608 Other 1,372 168 (5 ) 1,535 Technology 522 35 (3 ) 554 Total corporate fixed income portfolio 34,224 2,471 (202 ) 36,493 U.S. government and agencies 3,317 745 (4 ) 4,058 Municipal 23,354 1,514 (60 ) 24,808 Foreign government 2,155 319 (2 ) 2,472 Mortgage backed securities 14,351 342 (55 ) 14,638 Asset backed securities 5,036 102 (42 ) 5,096 Redeemable preferred stock 170 11 (5 ) 176 Total fixed income securities $ 82,607 $ 5,504 $ (370 ) $ 87,741 The banking, consumer goods and transportation sectors had the highest concentration of unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2003. The gross unrealized losses in these sectors are primarily company specific or interest rate related. While we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003. 73 The equity portfolio is comprised of securities in the following sectors. Gross unrealized At December 31, 2003 Fair value Cost Gains Losses (in millions) Consumer goods (cyclical and non cyclical) $ 882 $ 290 $ (10 ) $ 1,162 Technology 440 173 (3 ) 610 Financial services 441 163 (1 ) 603 Real estate 380 173 (1 ) 552 Capital goods 265 146 411 Banking 269 77 (1 ) 345 Communications 251 85 336 Energy 161 81 242 Basic industry 161 51 (1 ) 211 Utilities 114 23 (1 ) 136 Transportation 41 8 49 Other 623 8 631 Total equities $ 4,028 $ 1,278 $ (18 ) $ 5,288 During 2003, we have experienced an increase in gross unrealized gains and a decrease in gross unrealized losses as a result of a recovering equity market. The consumer goods sector has the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio at December 31, 2003, which were primarily company specific. While we expect eventual recovery of these securities and this sector, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003. The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2003. NAIC Rating Moodys, S&P or Equivalent Unrealized Loss Percent to Total Fair Value Percent to Total (in millions) 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ (189 ) 51.1 % $ 8,207 72.1 % 2 Baa (73 ) 19.7 2,120 18.6 3 Ba (34 ) 9.2 522 4.6 4 B (40 ) 10.8 314 2.8 5 Caa or lower (19 ) 5.1 142 1.2 6 In or near default (15 ) 4.1 74 0.7 Total $ (370 ) 100.0 % $ 11,379 100.0 % The table above includes redeemable preferred securities with a fair value of $46 million and an unrealized loss of $5 million. It also includes 73 securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a rating based on an analysis similar to that used by the NAIC, with a fair value totaling $896 million and an unrealized loss of $16 million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, processing of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC ("SVO"), and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating. At December 31, 2003, $262 million, or 70.8%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired. 74 As of December 31, 2003, $108 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 34.0% was in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003. Included among the securities that are rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were purchased at investment grade, but have since been downgraded. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities and through diversification of the portfolio. The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003 is shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of repayments by the issuers. (in millions) Unrealized Loss Percent to Total Fair Value Percent to Total Due in one year or less $ (9 ) 2.4 % $ 60 0.5 % Due after one year through five years (52 ) 14.1 789 6.9 Due after five years through ten years (71 ) 19.2 2,383 20.9 Due after ten years (141 ) 38.1 3,334 29.3 Mortgage and asset backed securities(1) (97 ) 26.2 4,813 42.4 Total $ (370 ) 100.0 % $ 11,379 100.0 % (1)Because of the potential for prepayment, mortgage and asset backed securities are not categorized based on their contractual maturities. Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list. The watch list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists. The unrealized loss balance for fixed income and equity securities can be further segmented into the following four categories of securities, with the unrealized net loss in each category at December 31, 2003 listed in parenthesis: (i)Securities with an unrealized loss less than 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities ($290 million of unrealized loss); (ii)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of less than six consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($53 million of unrealized loss); (iii)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of six or more consecutive months, but less than 12 consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($31 million of unrealized loss); and (iv)Securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for twelve or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($14 million of unrealized loss). 75 Categories (i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by the downturn in the financial markets, overall economic conditions, and the markets evaluation of certain sectors. While all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment, the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. In general, we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time. For category (iii) there were 6 equity securities with a fair value of $1 million and 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $58 million and $31 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being $7 million. Of the fixed income securities in this category, 7 securities with a fair value of $51 million and an unrealized loss of $23 million were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003. For category (iv) there were 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $37 million and $14 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being $5 million. All of these securities were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003. Whenever we decide that a fixed income securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12 months is temporary, we use a process of additional evaluations and management approvals to determine why a write down is not required. The following table contains the individual securities as of December 31, 2003, with the largest unrealized losses. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than 1.0% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities: (in millions) Unrealized Loss Fair Value NAIC Rating Unrealized Loss Category State General Obligation for a Pension Fund $ (8 ) $ 92 1 (i ) Shipping & Offshore Engineering (7 ) 13 5 (iii ) Foreign Dairy Conglomerate (7 ) 13 6 (ii ) Food Processing Company (6 ) 14 N/A (ii ) Chemical/Plastics Production & Distribution (5 ) 15 4 (iii ) Asset Backed Security for Aircraft Leases (5 ) 12 3 (iv ) Total $ (38 ) $ 159 We also monitor the quality of our fixed income portfolio by categorizing certain investments as "problem", "restructured" or "potential problem." Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have serious concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future. 76 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December 31. 2003 2002 Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Problem $ 325 $ 322 0.4 % $ 295 $ 279 0.4 % Restructured 64 64 0.1 42 36 Potential problem 397 382 0.4 647 572 0.7 Total net carrying value $ 786 $ 768 0.9 % $ 984 $ 887 1.1 % Cumulative write downs recognized $ 347 $ 474 We have experienced a decrease in our balance of fixed income securities categorized as potential problem as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. The decrease was related primarily to the sale of holdings in this category due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities. We also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003 and recorded write downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio. Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December 31.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the $453 million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of $851 million and gross losses of $398 million. Gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities were $396 million which, combined with investment write downs on fixed income and equity securities of $290 million, represents total gross realized losses of $686 million. Of the $396 million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities, $264 million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and $132 million resulted from sales of equity securities. In 2003, losses from sales were primarily related to routine reductions of exposures to deteriorating credits, reallocation of funds to other investments in a higher interest rate environment and equity portfolio turnover resulting from relative value opportunities. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Recognizing in certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent 77 credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security. The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $82 million with the largest being $42 million and the smallest being $3 million. Of those losses, four related to securities that were in our unrealized loss categories (iii) or (iv). Our largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns by issuer and its affiliates are shown in the following table. No other issuer and its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and writedowns greater than 2.0% of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities. We have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held.

Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk. We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans of $4 million, $2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Short Term Investments Our short term investment portfolio was $1.82 billion and $2.22 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of one year or less. We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is subsequently invested and included in short term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2003, the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of $569 million. This compares to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2002. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. Overview We generate substantial investable funds from our Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business. Investment guidelines define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over these risk management activities. In addition, the subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow guidelines that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and that specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given their liquidity, surplus, product, and regulatory requirements. Executive oversight of investment 79 risk management processes is conducted primarily through the boards of directors and investment committees of the subsidiaries conducting investment activities. Administration and detailed managerial oversight of investment risk, including market risk, is provided through our credit and risk management committee ("CRMC"). We also have an enterprise wide committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC") that is responsible for assessing risks, including market and other investment risks, on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations. We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation limits, duration limits and value at risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets over a time interval based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by the investment guidelines. Although we apply a common overall governance approach to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur an economic loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and carry significant interest sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations. We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2003, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.99, compared to a 0.34 gap at December 31, 2002. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. Most of our duration gap results from the Property Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property Liability assets and liabilities. For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit exposure to interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy includes using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from unintended duration mismatches between assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk related to anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers. 80 We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $42 million as of December 31, 2003. For over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2003, counterparties have posted collateral to us totaling $333 million. To calculate duration, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of Property Liability policies. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.77 billion, compared to $825 million at December 31, 2002. Additionally, there are $6.20 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments and as a result have not been included in the above estimate. This amount has increased from the $5.58 billion reported at December 31, 2002 due to increases in policies in force. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, these assets would decrease in value by $278 million, compared to a decrease of $218 million at December 31, 2002. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2003, we would recognize realized capital gains and losses totaling $13 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $(13) million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates. Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock, mutual fund, or stock index. At December 31, 2003, we held approximately $4.42 billion in common stocks and $1.30 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds and non redeemable preferred securities), compared to approximately $2.79 billion in common stocks and $1.15 billion in other equity investments at December 31, 2002. Approximately 99.0% and 58.8% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of 81 the Property Liability operations at December 31, 2003, compared to approximately 98.6% and 52.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, our portfolio of equity instruments had a beta of approximately 0.84, compared to a beta of approximately 0.79 at December 31, 2002. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, in mathematical terms, an investments market risk characteristics relative to the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will decrease by approximately 8.4%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will increase by approximately 8.4%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2003, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity portfolio identified above by approximately $478 million, compared to $312 million at December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The beta of our equity portfolio was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity portfolio to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had separate accounts assets with account values totaling $13.43 billion and $11.13 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $21 million and $18 million less in fee income at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial usually have a GMDB and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced GMDB, guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") prior to 2004 and beginning in 2004 a TrueReturnSM Accumulation Benefit ("GMAB") on certain contracts. These guarantees subject us to additional equity risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than the current account value. GMDBs are payable upon death, while GMIBs are payable on or after the ten year anniversary of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are payable on a date that is pre determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year of the contract. GMABs guarantee a return of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $2.46 billion and $4.07 billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2003. In both periods, approximately two thirds of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining one third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments during 2003 that were intended to offset a portion of 2003 expected death benefit payments and the risk of future death claims on all new business issued on January 1, 2003 and later, and any payments of GMABs. We estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMDBs for the next 40 quarters to be approximately $145 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $264 million at December 31, 2002. In order to calculate this estimate, we considered the current guarantees outstanding for all contracts that contain GMDBs, the expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for 82 DAC amortization. The decrease in this estimate at December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to the equity market improvement during the year. We also estimate the effect on expected future GMDB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December 31, 2003 would increase by an estimated $18 million during the next year. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model. Included among the GMIB contracts we have sold are contracts that provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed benefit feature was first offered in certain of our GMIB products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by the contractholders beginning in 2008. We estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMIBs for the next 40 years to be approximately $15 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $16 million at December 31, 2002. In calculating this estimate we considered the current mix of guarantees outstanding, expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for DAC amortization. The decrease in 2003 is primarily due to improved equity markets in 2003, partially offset by the fact that contractholders are one year closer to being eligible to annuitize. We also estimate the effect on our expected future GMIB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders account values as of December 31, 2003 due to equity market declines, there would be no immediate effect on our earnings or cash flow, since these benefits are not payable until at least 2008. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. As of December 31, 2003 we do not have a reserve established for the GMDBs or GMIBs; however, this will change with the adoption of Statement of Position 03 01 in 2004. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this pending accounting change. Additional sales of variable annuity contracts will increase our equity risk because of these benefits. An increase in the equity markets above the December 31, 2003 level will increase account values for these contracts, thereby decreasing the risk of the GMDBs, GMIBs and GMABs being utilized in the future. Likewise, a decrease in the equity markets that causes a decrease in the account values will increase our equity risk because of these benefits. In addition to our GMDB and GMIB equity risk, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 we had approximately $1.55 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively, in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with guaranteed crediting rates based on the price of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits. Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable life and annuity contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small 83 amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $380 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $492 million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $246 million and $375 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property Liability business. Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $87 million, compared with an estimated $62 million decrease at December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 31 countries, slightly reduced from 35 countries at December 31, 2002. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2003 were to the Canadian dollar (58.9%) and the British pound (10.5%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2002 were to the Canadian dollar (60.7%) and the British pound (7.3%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.8% at December 31, 2003, compared to 26.7% at December 31, 2002. The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents. See Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. Net periodic pension cost in 2004 is estimated to be $291 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2003 and 2002 principally due to unfavorable returns on plan assets, and decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on market trends and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In each of the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from benefit payments made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as payments continue to be made to agents in connection with the reorganization of Allstates multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program during 2000. As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period, which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in 2002 and 2001 primarily due to the decline in the equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in 84 increased amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $92 million in 2003 and $11 million in 2002. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the projected benefit obligations or 10% of the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poors or at least "Aa" by Moodys on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $48 million in net periodic pension cost and a $762 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2003, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $40 million in net periodic pension cost and a $224 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $40 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by $52 million as of October 31, 2003, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $36 million and a $207 million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2002. This non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $34 million in pension cost at October 31, 2003, compared to an increase of $26 million at October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $34 million at October 31, 2003, compared to a decrease of $26 million at October 31, 2002. Changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability. 85 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December 31. (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders equity items $ 17,809 $ 15,705 $ 15,533 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,756 1,733 1,663 Total shareholders equity 20,565 17,438 17,196 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 200 200 Debt 5,076 4,240 3,921 Total capital resources $ 25,641 $ 21,878 $ 21,317 Ratio of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to shareholders equity 24.7 % 25.5 % 24.0 % Shareholders equity increased in 2003 when compared to 2002, as net income, unrealized net capital gains on investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. Shareholders equity increased in 2002 when compared to 2001, due to higher net income and unrealized capital gains that were partially offset by an increase in the minimum pension liability, dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. In February 2004, we announced a $1.00 billion increase in the current share repurchase program. As of the date of this announcement, the current share repurchase program had $1.35 billion remaining, and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2005. Treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity, and since 1995, we have repurchased 263 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.53 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 68 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were eliminated as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position effective July 1, 2003, because of the adoption of FIN 46. This accounting guidance required the de consolidation of Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a subsidiary that we own 100%, and the recognition of debt that we had previously issued to AF II, the proceeds of which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. For further discussion of the capital structure of AF II, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. Debt increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the adoption of FIN 46 and increases in long term borrowings outstanding, partly offset by declines in short term borrowings outstanding. The adoption of FIN 46, effective July 1, 2003, increased long term debt by $1.05 billion, including $691 million for the consolidation of two VIEs to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third party investors, $112 million for the consolidation of a VIE for a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores, $45 million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated investment security, and $200 million of the debt we issued to AF II that is no longer required to be consolidated. Although we are required to consolidate the two VIEs used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under FIN 46, we have no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt. Our maximum exposure related to these two entities is the current value of our equity investment, which totaled $12 million at December 31, 2003. Moodys and Standard and Poors have apprised us that the reported debt associated with the consolidation of these VIEs will 86 be excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders equity for ratings considerations. This analytical ratio was 21.3% as of December 31, 2003. For more information on the adoption of FIN 46, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. In June 2003, we issued $400 million of 5.350% Senior Notes due in 2033, utilizing the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the $300 million of 63/4% Notes due 2003 and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2003, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The increase in debt in 2002 compared to the 2001 level was primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2012, and the issuance of $250 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2032. The proceeds of the $350 million issuance were used for general corporate purposes, and the proceeds of the $250 million issuance were used to redeem $250 million of 7?% Senior Quarterly Interest Bonds. Both of the senior note issuances in 2002 were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2000. Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December 31, 2003. Moodys Standard & Poors A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P 1 A 1 AMB 1 Allstate Insurance Company (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ American Heritage Life Insurance Company (financial strength) Aa3 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. In February 2004, A.M. Best revised the outlook to stable from positive for the insurance financial strength ratings of ALIC and certain rated subsidiaries and affiliates. The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a companys premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AICs premium to surplus ratio was 1.5x on December 31, 2003 compared to 1.7x in the prior year. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurers risk based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurers solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2003, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions. 87  The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges. Liquidity Sources and Uses Our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table. Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Receipt of insurance premiums X X Allstate Financial contractholder fund deposits X Reinsurance recoveries X X Receipts of principal, interest and dividends on investments X X X Sales of investments X X X Funds from investment repurchase agreements, securities lending, dollar roll, commercial paper and lines of credit agreements X X X Inter company loans and tax refunds/settlements X X X Capital contributions from parent X X Dividends from subsidiaries X X X Funds from periodic issuance of additional securities X Funds from the settlement of our benefit plans X Our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table.

Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Consolidated (in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,450 $ 2,543 $ 535 $ 2,256 $ 1,887 $ 1,771 $ (15 ) $ (7 ) $ (15 ) $ 5,691 $ 4,423 $ 2,291 Investing activities (2,344 ) (1,613 ) 628 (6,769 ) (7,560 ) (4,822 ) (351 ) 165 (166 ) (9,464 ) (9,008 ) (4,360 ) Financing activities 11 92 (1,190 ) 4,554 5,443 3,115 (888 ) (751 ) 185 3,677 4,784 2,110 Net increase in consolidated cash $ (96 ) $ 199 $ 41 Property Liability Higher operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to increased underwriting income. In 2003, operating cash flows were also impacted by contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2003 and 2002 as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios. Cash flows of the Property Liability business are also impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation. These dividends totaled $1.18 billion, $675 million and $1.24 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Allstate Financial Higher operating cash flows of Allstate Financial in 2003 and 2002 primarily relates to increases in investment income, partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth. Cash flows used in investing activities declined in 2003 compared to 2002 as the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow. Lower cash flow from financing activities during 2003 reflects an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders accounts, partially offset by increased deposits received from contractholders. Higher cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects increased deposits received from contractholders. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financials liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2003. Approximately 14.8% of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment. (in millions) 2003 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 11,266 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges(1) 19,526 Market value 9,316 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 6,963 Total Contractholder funds $ 47,071 (1)Includes $9.81 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. 89 Corporate and Other Higher uses of cash in the investing activities of our Corporate and Other segment during 2003 reflect additional net investments made in the portfolio of the subsidiary, Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, when we increase or decrease the level of these activities, financing cash flows are affected. Long term debt and invested assets increased during 2003 related to the adoption of FIN 46. However since these increases did not impact our cash flows and were non cash entries, they had no impact to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines of credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2003 these sources could provide over $2.3 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of the investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $15.84 billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent 15.4% of the investment portfolio, and $6.54 billion of mortgage loans that represent 6.3% of the investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios. We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows: A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily. Two primary credit facilities and one additional credit facility totaling $1.20 billion to cover short term liquidity requirements. These consist of a $575 million five year revolving line of credit expiring in 2006, a $575 million 364 day revolving line of credit expiring in the second quarter of 2004 and a $50 million one year revolving line of credit expiring in the third quarter of 2004. The right to borrow under the five year and 364 day facilities is subject to requirements that are customary for facilities of this size, type and purpose. These requirements are currently being met and we expect to continue to meet them in the future. There were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit during 2003. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the three credit facilities is limited to $1.20 billion. The right to issue up to an additional $2.80 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long term debt rating of A1 and A+ (from Moodys and Standard & Poors, respectively) to non investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB , a downgrade in AICs financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A , or a downgrade in ALICs financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA /A . The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, and therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 90 Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Securities Lending, Dollar Rolls, and Repurchase Agreements(1) $ 3,416 $ 3,416 $ $ $ Guaranteed Investment Contracts ("GICs")/Funding Agreements (non putable)(2) 7,762 1,809 2,513 1,350 2,090 Funding Agreements (putable/callable)(2) 1,794 778 1,016 Payout Annuities/Structured Settlements(3) 30,765 841 2,528 1,619 25,777 Long Term Debt(4) 5,074 1,605 1 3,468 Capital Lease Obligations(4) 36 2 3 4 27 Operating Leases(4) 944 247 324 184 189 Unconditional Purchase Obligations(4) 392 223 121 48 Pension Obligations(4),(5) 163 151 8 4 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 50,346 $ 7,467 $ 8,118 $ 3,210 $ 31,551 (1)Securities lending, dollar rolls and repurchase transactions are typically fully collateralized with marketable securities. We manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. (2)The putable/callable funding agreement program as well as the non putable funding agreement and GIC programs are very closely asset/liability duration matched by ALIC. Accordingly, ALIC maintains assets with a sufficient market value to extinguish the liabilities in the normal course of business upon expected surrender or maturity of the related contracts. (3)ALIC closely manages the assets supporting payout annuities/structured settlement liabilities. (4)Our payment obligations relating to long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program. (5)Pension obligations represent approved contributions to our pension plans. Our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2003 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table.

We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required. 91 REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Regulation We are subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. Recent state and federal regulatory initiatives and proceedings have included efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies, limit insurers ability to impose underwriting standards and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on our business, if any, are uncertain. Legal Proceedings We are involved in various legal and regulatory actions that have an effect on specific aspects of our business. Like other members of the insurance industry, we are the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. For a detailed description of these actions, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December 31, 2003, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. These standards include Statement of Position 03 01, FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic number 03 01. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on our interpretation and application of Statement of Position 03 01, we estimate that upon adoption on January 1, 2004, it will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the range of $150 million to $200 million. However, the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS This document contains "forward looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. These forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC. In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services. 92 Risks Relating to the Property Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tropical storms, wildfires and terrorism. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, totaling $2.3 billion, and to the Northridge earthquake of 1994, totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various Florida state created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as snowstorms, ice storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur. Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Property Liability business. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of changes in the rate of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of Texas. Although we are currently pursuing various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment that seek to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. Recently, our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The recent favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but not reported, after considering known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar losses, historical trends involving claim payment 93 patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active claims; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position. Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Moreover, because Allstate Protections loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurers ability to charge an adequate price or mandating subsidized rates. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at an inadequate or subsidized price, leading to an unacceptable return on capital. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurers ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. The potential benefits of implementing SRM may not be fully realized We believe that the tier based pricing and underwriting approach (including the use of credit history as an underwriting criterion) used in SRM has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, our competitors may adopt underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models similar to those used in SRM. Further, the use of credit history as a factor in underwriting and 94 pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify SRM. Furthermore, because we have been using SRM only for the last several years, we cannot make assurances that SRM underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated through the use of SRM. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using SRM will increase may not be realized. Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. In 2002 and 2003, prices in Allstate Protections principal lines increased more quickly than in prior years, and underwriting standards became more stringent. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review and revise our reserve estimates and if future experience differs from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates on business. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, assets may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. For example, during 2003 the average pre tax investment yield for the Allstate Financial portfolio declined to 6.0% from 6.7% in 2002. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segments investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability. Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the United States and international stock markets affect Allstate Financials sales of variable annuities. Recent allegations of improper or illegal trading activities at large mutual fund 95 complexes could affect the stock markets. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB and GMAB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or Allstate Financials net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest sensitive life, variable annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. This risk may be heightened by the enactment of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act"), which eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurers and other financial service providers. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products (primarily life insurance and annuities) we offer receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. One such proposal was enacted in May 2003 when President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, recent changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. 96  Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar insurance products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we may face increased competition from banks. Until passage of the GLB Act, the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses was limited and banks were restricted from being affiliated with insurers. With the passage of the GLB Act, mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company are now permitted. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. Changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolios average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. A declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans. We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large insurance group, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation. Among other things, we, like other participants in the insurance industry, have been subject in recent years to an increasing volume of class action litigation challenging a range of industry practices. Our litigation exposure could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation. For a description of our current material litigation matters, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth We are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance regulators. This regulation is focused on the protection of policyholders and not investors. In many cases, state regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Additionally, we have various entities registered under the federal securities laws as broker dealers, investment advisers and or investment companies. These entities are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the SEC, the National Association of 97 Securities Dealers and, in some cases, state securities administrators. The laws regulating the securities products and activities of Allstate Financial are complex, numerous and subject to change. Further, in recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and proposals that would provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies have been discussed by members of Congress. We can make no assurances as to whether further state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance industry or as to the effect that any such measures would have on us. The unavailability of reinsurance may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure or reduce our insurance writings. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim expense we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. In the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial may be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally will have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a decline in the value of an insurers investment portfolio or increased liabilities for variable contracts arising from additional GMDB, GMIB or GMAB exposure resulting from market declines. Currently, the insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively). Because these ratings are subject to periodic review, the continued retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, including the competitiveness and marketability of our product offerings, as well as our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. 98 Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt. Item 7A.
