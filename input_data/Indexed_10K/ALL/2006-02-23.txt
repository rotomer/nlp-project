That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 4 ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Products and Distribution Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Our principal products are deferred and immediate fixed annuities, variable annuities, interest sensitive and traditional life insurance, and supplemental accident and health insurance. Our principal institutional product is funding agreements backing medium term notes. The table on page 6 lists our major distribution channels for this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers. As the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents, banks, broker dealers, and specialized structured settlement brokers. We have distribution relationships with over half of the 75 largest banks, most of the national broker dealers, a number of regional brokerage firms and many independent broker dealers. We sell products through independent agents affiliated with approximately 175 master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate exclusive agencies also sell our supplemental accident and health insurance products primarily to employees of small and medium size firms. We sell funding agreements to unaffiliated trusts used to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. 5 Allstate Financial Distribution Channels, Products and Target Customers Distribution Channel Primary Products Target Customers Allstate exclusive agencies (Allstate Exclusive Agents and Allstate Exclusive Financial Specialists) Term life insurance Interest sensitive life insurance Variable life insurance Deferred fixed annuities (including indexed and market value adjusted "MVAA") Immediate fixed annuities Variable annuities Cancer insurance Bank products (Certificates of deposit, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, first mortgage loans and home equity loans) Workplace life and supplemental accident and health insurance (Interest sensitive and term life insurance; disability income insurance; cancer, accident, critical illness and heart/stroke insurance; hospital indemnity; limited benefit medical insurance; and dental insurance) Moderate and middle income consumers with retirement and family financial protection needs Independent agents (Through master brokerage agencies) Term life insurance Interest sensitive life insurance Variable life insurance Deferred fixed annuities (including indexed and MVAA) Immediate fixed annuities Variable annuities Affluent and middle income consumers with retirement and family financial protection needs Independent agents (As workplace enrolling agents) Workplace life and supplemental accident and health insurance (Interest sensitive and term life insurance; disability income insurance; cancer, accident, critical illness and heart/stroke insurance; hospital indemnity; limited benefit medical insurance; and dental insurance) Moderate and middle income consumers with family financial protection needs employed by small and medium size firms Banks Deferred fixed annuities (including indexed and MVAA) Variable annuities Single premium fixed life insurance Middle income consumers with retirement needs Broker dealers Deferred fixed annuities (including indexed and MVAA) Variable annuities Single premium variable life insurance Affluent and middle income consumers with retirement needs Structured settlement annuity brokers Structured settlement annuities Typically used to fund or annuitize large claims or litigation settlements Broker dealers (Funding agreements) Funding agreements backing medium term notes Institutional and individual investors 6 Competition We compete principally on the basis of the scope of our distribution systems, the breadth of our product offerings, the recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our product features and prices, and the level of customer service that we provide. In addition, with respect to variable annuity and variable life insurance products in particular, we compete on the basis of the variety of fund managers and choices of funds for our separate accounts and the management and performance of those funds within our separate accounts. With regard to funding agreements, we compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings. The market for life insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2005, there were approximately 740 groups of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. Based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, as of December 31, 2004, the Allstate Financial segment ranked 13th based on ordinary life insurance in force and 17th based on statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure is growing due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry. Our website for financial professionals, accessallstate.com, won DALBARs Communications Seal beginning in 2004. The site attained DALBARs highest designation of "Excellent" as of the second, third and fourth quarter of 2005 based on its overall quarterly rankings for Life Insurance/Annuity websites for Financial Professionals. DALBAR, Inc., an independent financial services research organization, recognized accessallstate.com for providing a means by which financial professionals can easily and conveniently develop and manage their business online. Geographic Markets We sell life insurance, retirement and investment products throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We sell funding agreements in the United States and in the Cayman Islands. The following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended December 31, 2005, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. Approximately 99.0% of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations generated in Delaware represent deposits received in connection with funding agreements sold to trusts domiciled in Delaware. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations. Delaware 26.4 % California 8.4 % New York 6.8 % Florida 5.8 % Additional Information Information regarding the last three years revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Financial segment is contained in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 18 also includes information regarding the last three years identifiable assets attributable to the Allstate Financial segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. 7 Information regarding premiums and contract charges for Allstate Financial segment products for the last three years is set forth in Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 69, in the table that summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non insurance operations. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three years. Our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other business in run off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. RESERVE FOR PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. 8  Reconciliation of Claims Reserves The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Year Ended December 31, GROSS ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 19,338 $ 17,714 $ 16,690 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 25,319 18,994 17,183 Change in provision attributable to prior years (127 ) 448 704 Total claims and claims expense 25,192 19,442 17,887 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 14,966 11,494 10,240 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 7,447 6,324 6,623 Total payments 22,413 17,818 16,863 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table $ 22,117 $ 19,338 $ 17,714 Year Ended December 31, NET ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 16,761 $ 15,980 $ 15,018 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 21,643 18,073 17,031 Change in provision attributable to prior years (468 ) (230 ) 401 Total claims and claims expense 21,175 17,843 17,432 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 12,340 10,989 10,195 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,665 6,073 6,275 Total payments 19,005 17,062 16,470 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table(1) $ 18,931 $ 16,761 $ 15,980 (1)Reserves for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $3.19 billion, $2.58 billion, and $1.73 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 9 The year end 2005 gross reserves of $22.12 billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $4.32 billion more than the net reserve balance of $17.79 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $3.19 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $854 million. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting. As the tables above illustrate, Allstates net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2004 decreased in 2005 by $468 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of $127 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions. Loss Reserve Reestimates The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstates expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. 10 Loss Reserve Reestimates December 31, ($ millions) 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Gross Reserves for Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 17,326 $ 17,382 $ 17,403 $ 16,881 $ 17,814 $ 16,859 $ 16,500 $ 16,690 $ 17,714 $ 19,338 $ 22,117 Deduct: Reinsurance Recoverable 1,490 1,784 1,630 1,458 1,653 1,634 1,667 1,672 1,734 2,577 3,186 Reserve For Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 15,836 $ 15,598 $ 15,773 $ 15,423 $ 16,161 $ 15,225 $ 14,833 $ 15,018 $ 15,980 $ 16,761 $ 18,931 Paid (cumulative) as of: One year later 5,787 5,013 5,488 5,615 5,973 6,748 6,874 6,275 6,073 6,665 Two years later 8,232 7,952 8,361 8,638 9,055 10,066 9,931 9,241 9,098 Three years later 10,083 9,773 10,336 10,588 11,118 11,889 11,730 11,165 Four years later 11,170 11,040 11,587 11,950 12,197 12,967 12,949 Five years later 12,034 11,847 12,512 12,608 12,842 13,768 Six years later 12,590 12,528 12,967 13,038 13,434 Seven years later 13,134 12,881 13,294 13,532 Eight years later 13,429 13,146 13,735 Nine years later 13,660 13,553 Ten years later 14,048 Reserve Reestimated as of: End of year 15,836 15,598 15,773 15,423 16,161 15,225 14,833 15,018 15,980 16,761 18,931 One year later 15,500 14,921 15,073 14,836 15,439 15,567 15,518 15,419 15,750 16,293 Two years later 14,917 14,450 14,548 14,371 15,330 15,900 16,175 15,757 15,677 Three years later 14,700 14,156 14,183 14,296 15,583 16,625 16,696 15,949 Four years later 14,613 13,894 14,168 14,530 16,317 17,249 16,937 Five years later 14,455 13,888 14,406 15,260 17,033 17,501 Six years later 14,452 14,140 15,109 16,024 17,302 Seven years later 14,703 14,824 15,899 16,292 Eight years later 15,370 15,625 16,184 Nine years later 16,160 15,911 Ten years later 16,451 Initial reserve in excess of (less than) reestimated reserve: Amount of reestimate $ (615 ) $ (313 ) $ (411 ) $ (869 ) $ (1,141 ) $ (2,276 ) $ (2,104 ) $ (931 ) $ 303 $ 468 Percent 3.9 % 2.0 % 2.6 % 5.6 % 7.1 % 14.9 % 14.2 % 6.2 % 1.9 % 2.8 % Gross Reestimated Liability Latest $ 19,253 $ 19,020 $ 19,104 $ 19,105 $ 20,229 $ 20,423 $ 19,836 $ 18,832 $ 18,383 $ 19,211 Reestimated Recoverable Latest 2,802 3,109 2,920 2,813 2,927 2,922 2,899 2,883 2,706 2,918 Net Reestimated Liability Latest $ 16,451 $ 15,911 $ 16,184 $ 16,292 $ 17,302 $ 17,501 $ 16,937 $ 15,949 $ 15,677 $ 16,293 Gross Cumulative Reestimate (Increase) Decrease $ (1,927 ) $ (1,638 ) $ (1,701 ) $ (2,224 ) $ (2,415 ) $ (3,564 ) $ (3,336 ) $ (2,142 ) $ (669 ) $ 127 Amount of Reestimates for Each Segment December 31, ($ millions) 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Net Discontinued Lines and Coverages Reestimate $ (2,054 ) $ (1,719 ) $ (1,751 ) $ (1,679 ) $ (1,642 ) $ (1,633 ) $ (1,607 ) $ (1,376 ) $ (802 ) $ (167 ) Net Allstate Protection Reestimate 1,439 1,406 1,340 810 501 (643 ) (497 ) 445 1,105 635 Amount of Reestimate (Net) $ (615 ) $ (313 ) $ (411 ) $ (869 ) $ (1,141 ) $ (2,276 ) $ (2,104 ) $ (931 ) $ 303 $ 468 11 As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established from December 31, 1995 to December 31, 2002 reflects additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The decreases in net reserves established as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below. The following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended December 31, 2005. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s).

The favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. Favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs. The impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude. Beginning in the early 1990s, lower medical cost inflation rates, as evidenced by the consumer price index ("CPI") published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for medical costs, have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates. From 1991 through 1995, the medical CPI averaged 6.3%, and from 1996 through 2000, the average declined to 3.4%. The medical CPI is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies, including doctors fees, emergency care, therapy and rehabilitation, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are covered claims for insureds. In 2005, the medical CPI was 4.2%, and most recent economic forecasts anticipate future increases in medical inflation. If this occurs, future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates. Our loss management programs over time have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends. We have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims, consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims, more accurate valuation of damages, and more effective negotiation and defense practices. These 12 improvements have also involved hiring additional staff, providing increased training, creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims, and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims, claims with attorney involvement, and claims in litigation. These programs were intended to create an improved culture, focused on expert, efficient, and effective claim process management. Since 1993, growth of Allstates injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results. We believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements, and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates. While changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims, these changes can impact historical patterns of losses, introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims. In 2005 and 2004, we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years. Favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In 2003 and 2002, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2003, were due to favorable Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates, offset by unfavorable increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2002 were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In 2001, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported in the year 2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the Encompass and Canadian businesses. For additional information regarding reserves, see "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves." REGULATION Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries, not the holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, accounting methods, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Notes 13 and 15 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. In recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope 13 of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. Agent and Broker Compensation. In 2005, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. As of the end of the year, new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states, including Texas. Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive. Holding Company Regulation. The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporations common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporations common stock. Price Regulation. Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the states regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file and use, or (iii) use and file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it. In states having file and use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulators approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A 14 use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Approximately one half of the states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing. An insurers ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurers ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. Changes in Allstates claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments. From time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing. Involuntary Markets. As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations. Guaranty Funds. Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. National Flood Insurance Program. We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own ("WYO") carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). The NFIP is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"). We operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy ("SFIP"). This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States Treasury. We receive expense allowances from NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commission and adjuster fees. Investment Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of 15 non conforming investments. As of December 31, 2005 the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects. Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non Renewing Policies. Most states regulate an insurers ability to exit a market. For example, states limit, to varying degrees, an insurers ability to cancel and non renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurers ability to exit unprofitable markets. Variable Life Insurance, Variable Annuities and Registered Fixed Annuities. The sale of variable life insurance, variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers. Broker Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies. The Allstate entities that operate as broker dealers, registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company group. In addition, it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, including our parent company, to engage in activities that are not financial in nature. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Banking. The Allstate Corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift Supervision. The bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking. Privacy Regulation. Federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information. Asbestos. President Bush has indicated support for efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation. Congress has considered such legislation in the past, but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. In February 2006, there was a renewed effort to bring such measures before the Senate. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos. Environmental. Environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini Superfund") govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties" (PRPs). Superfund and the mini Superfunds (Environmental Clean up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent 16 on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response, investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstates exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted. INTERNET WEBSITE Our Internet website address is allstate.com.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities As of January 31, 2006, there were 146,468 record holders of The Allstate Corporations common stock. The principal market for the common stock is the New York Stock Exchange but it is also listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Set forth below are the high and low New York Stock Exchange Composite listing prices of, and cash dividends declared for, the common stock during 2005 and 2004. High Low Close Dividends Declared 2005 First quarter 55.41 49.66 54.06 .32 Second quarter 60.87 52.35 59.75 .32 Third quarter 63.22 49.90 55.29 .32 Fourth quarter 57.91 51.61 54.07 .32 2004 First quarter 47.19 42.55 45.46 .28 Second quarter 48.16 42.91 46.55 .28 Third quarter 49.22 45.50 47.99 .28 Fourth quarter 51.99 45.50 51.72 .28 The payment of dividends by Allstate Insurance Company to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In the twelve month period ending December 31, 2005, Allstate Insurance Company paid dividends of $3.86 billion. Based on the greater of 2005 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that Allstate Insurance Company will be able to pay without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2006 is $1.75 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus. 20 Period Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased(1) Average Price Paid per Share (or Unit) Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(2) Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares (or Units) that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs October 1, 2005 October 31, 2005 1,890,000 $ 53.6066 1,890,000 $1.7 billion November 1, 2005 November 30, 2005 1,090,953 $ 56.1161 1,090,000 $1.6 billion December 1, 2005 December 31, 2005 1,345,000 $ 54.9727 1,345,000 $1.5 billion Total 4,325,953 $ 54.6642 4,325,000 (1)Shares repurchased other than through a publicly announced program.

Previously, the trust preferred securities were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts and the dividends reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. The impact of deconsolidation was to increase long term debt and decrease mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts by $200 million. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect this change. (2)We use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property Liability results. We believe that they enhance an investors understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses; Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned; Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting (loss) income as a percentage of premiums earned. 22   Item 7.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5 year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Segment sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include: For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and severity (average cost per claim) trends, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses and underwriting results; For Allstate Financial: premiums, deposits, gross margin including investment and benefit margins, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, expenses, operating income, and invested assets; For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration; For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt leverage, and return on equity; and For product distribution: profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate exclusive agencies sales of all products and services. 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Net income was $1.77 billion in 2005 compared to a net income of $3.18 billion in 2004. Net income per diluted share was $2.64 in 2005 compared to net income per diluted share of $4.54 in 2004. These declines were primarily due to catastrophes. Total revenues reached a record $35.38 billion, an increase of 4.3% compared to last year. Property Liability premiums earned increased 4.0% to $27.04 billion. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, primarily due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, with an impact to the combined ratio of 21.0 points, compared to $2.47 billion in 2004, with a combined ratio impact of 9.5 points. Allstate Financial investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Total of $2.45 billion shares of stock were repurchased during the year. Book value per share was $31.01 as of December 31, 2005 compared to $31.72 as of December 31, 2004. Return on equity declined 6.6 points to 8.4%. 24 CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Property liability insurance premiums $ 27,039 $ 25,989 $ 24,677 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges 2,049 2,072 2,304 Net investment income 5,746 5,284 4,972 Realized capital gains and losses 549 591 196 Total revenues 35,383 33,936 32,149 Costs and expenses Property liability insurance claims and claims expense (21,175 ) (17,843 ) (17,432 ) Life and annuity contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2,403 ) (2,001 ) (1,846 ) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (4,721 ) (4,465 ) (4,058 ) Operating costs and expenses (2,997 ) (3,040 ) (3,001 ) Restructuring and related charges (41 ) (51 ) (74 ) Interest expense (330 ) (308 ) (275 ) Total costs and expenses (33,282 ) (29,326 ) (28,537 ) Loss on disposition of operations (13 ) (24 ) (41 ) Income tax expense (323 ) (1,230 ) (846 ) Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust(s) (5 ) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax 1,765 3,356 2,720 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (15 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 Property Liability $ 1,431 $ 3,045 $ 2,521 Allstate Financial 416 246 305 Corporate and Other (82 ) (110 ) (121 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have identified five accounting policies that require us to make assumptions and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates related to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on 25 either widely accepted pricing valuation models, which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs, or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities, are difficult to independently observe and quantify. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities. For investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities, net of deferred income taxes, is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a securitys fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors. For our portfolio review evaluations, we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration, revision to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions; and any dispositions planned by the portfolio managers. In these instances, we recognize impairment on securities being considered for these approved planned actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near term and long term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuers ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducement costs and related deferred tax, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness We primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, particularly in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is 26 based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transactions variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. DAC related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. DAC related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximate the estimated lives of the policies. DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits which includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization periods range from 15 30 years; however, estimates of customer surrender rates, partial withdrawals and deaths generally result in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. AGP and EGP consist of the following components: benefit margins primarily from mortality, including guaranteed minimum death, income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses. DAC amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is estimated using stochastic modeling and is significantly impacted by the anticipated return on the underlying funds. Our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance, net of fees, was approximately 7% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 and 2003. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from the expectation, we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return 27 over a seven year period equals the long term expectation. This process is referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the future mean rates of return including fees projected over the five year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. We periodically evaluate the results of utilizing this process to confirm that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long term mean within this time horizon. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking". For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A and Note 2 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements. Reserve for Property Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date. Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the current accident year as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years. We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. Accordingly, we believe that it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined. 28 The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, excluding the unprecedented hurricane losses experienced in 2005 which we expect will be paid during 2006, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Catastrophe Losses, Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Life Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. For further discussion of these policies, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A. 29 PROPERTY LIABILITY 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 35, reached a record $27.39 billion during 2005. Compared to 2004, premiums written increased 3.2% due to increases in the number of policies in force ("PIF") for Allstate brand standard auto of 2.9% and homeowners of 3.4% and higher average premiums. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners premiums written increased 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in 2005 over 2004. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums decreased 0.3% and 7.0%, respectively, compared to 2004. Underwriting loss for Property Liability was $636 million in 2005 compared to underwriting income of $1.83 billion in 2004 due to higher catastrophes, increased severity of current year claims and a $120 million accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit and lower favorable Allstate Protection reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable claim frequencies excluding catastrophes and lower unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years in Discontinued Lines and Coverages in 2005. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP, is defined below. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion compared to $2.47 billion in 2004. The effect of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio was 21.0 and 9.5 points in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Catastrophe losses include $5.00 billion related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million for assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida ("FL Citizens"). PROPERTY LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two brands, the Allstate brand and Encompass brand. Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 32, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting (loss) income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investors understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses. 30 Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting (loss) income as a percentage of premiums earned. We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods. Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned. Effect of pretax reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of pretax reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio on page 43 is equal to the Property Liability combined ratio. 31  Summarized financial data, a reconciliation of underwriting (loss) income to net income and GAAP operating ratios for our Property Liability operations for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

The Encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products while the Deerbrook brand is used for non standard auto products. The key elements of the Allstate Protection strategy are: Investing in marketing and brand awareness Improving customer experience Expanding distribution Utilizing sophisticated pricing and underwriting discipline Developing innovative and differentiated products Leveraging claims capabilities We are seeking, through the utilization of our distribution channels, our sophisticated risk segmentation process ("Tiered Pricing") and consumer marketing, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We maintain a broad marketing approach throughout the U.S. We have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on Allstate brand profitability, unit growth, retention, and sales of Allstate Financial products. We differentiate the Allstate brand from competitors through new innovative products such as Allstate&reg; Your Choice Auto. We continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brands exclusive agencies and The Good Hands&reg; Network. Tiered Pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential, and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard/non standard model. Tiered Pricing includes our Strategic Risk Management ("SRM") program, which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including, to the extent legally permissible, insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports. We continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases. As we continue to use Tiered Pricing, there is a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations, including the distinctions between standard and non standard which have become less relevant in certain states. For this reason, we believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non standard business. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers. Substantially all of new and approximately 61% of renewal business written for Allstate brand auto uses Tiered Pricing, an increase from 58% in 2004 when computed on a comparable basis. For Allstate brand homeowners, approximately 82% of new and 43% of renewal business written uses Tiered Pricing. For Allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under Tiered Pricing, our results indicate an 33 increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results. Our strategy for the Encompass brand focuses on those markets that give us the best opportunity to grow profitably, in part by using Tiered Pricing. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for PIF. As a result, percent changes in PIF, average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion. We are continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators, such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels including cost of reinsurance coverage purchased and catastrophe losses, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes. An important element of our strategy is to manage our property catastrophe exposure to enable our shareholders to earn an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers. Although in many areas of the country we are currently achieving returns within acceptable risk tolerances, we continue to seek solutions to improve returns in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes. We will significantly reduce our catastrophe exposure over time while working to mitigate the impact of our actions on customers. We are also working for changes in the regulatory environment, including fewer restrictions on underwriting, recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property lines. Pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe) are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing. Accordingly, property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products. Actions we are taking and evaluating to attain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our personal and commercial property businesses include: additional purchases of reinsurance; increased participation in various state facilities such as wind pools; changes in rates, deductibles and coverage; limitations on new business writings; changes to underwriting requirements; non renewal; discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences; withdrawal from certain markets; and or pursuing alternative markets for placement of business or segments of risk exposure in certain areas. While actions taken will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our personal and commercial property businesses, we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines when evaluating the feasibility of their implementation. In order to assess and monitor our actions, we are considering and adopting new performance measurements for managing our property business. These measurements currently include exposure limits based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, acceptable targeted rates of return by line and by state and potential exposure to capital impairment. As part of our catastrophe management efforts, we are involved with a newly created coalition called ProtectingAmerica.org. The coalition is dedicated to raising awareness, educating the public and 34 policymakers, and offering solutions that will better prepare and protect consumers, taxpayers and the American economy from major catastrophes in a sensible, cost effective fashion. A comprehensive solution is being advanced that includes the development of government sponsored, privately funded catastrophe funds at the state and national levels; improved prevention and mitigation measures, including the adoption of more effective land use policies and stronger building codes; enhanced public education about catastrophe risk; better catastrophe relief, recovery and rebuilding processes; and a rigorous process of continuous improvement for catastrophe preparedness and response programs and processes. Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken during 2005 and 2004 will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned. % earned after (in millions) 2005 2004 90 days 180 days 270 days 360 days Allstate brand: Standard auto $ 3,851 $ 3,703 74.3 % 98.8 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Non standard auto 401 455 73.3 % 98.1 % 99.6 % 100.0 % Auto 4,252 4,158 74.2 % 98.7 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners 3,252 3,029 43.3 % 75.5 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 1,302 1,309 44.5 % 75.9 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Total Allstate brand 8,806 8,496 59.5 % 87.6 % 97.1 % 100.0 % Encompass brand: Standard auto 594 606 44.0 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 28 36 75.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Auto 622 642 45.4 % 76.8 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Homeowners 317 289 43.7 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 84 78 44.1 % 75.9 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Total Encompass brand 1,023 1,009 44.8 % 76.4 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Total Allstate Protection unearned premiums $ 9,829 $ 9,505 57.9 % 86.4 % 96.8 % 100.0 % 35 A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.

Renewal business premiums increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in renewal average premiums. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher average new and renewal premiums primarily due to a shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos and, to a lesser extent, rate actions. The level of rate changes declined in 2005 due to frequency declines and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. Additionally, the state of New York implemented a rate reduction in July 2005 that reduced the countrywide rate impact by 0.4%. Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty. New business comparisons in 2004 also reflected the July 2003 implementation of our new rating plan in the California market. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. The rate of increase in average premium declined in 2004 due to the decrease in rate activity. The reduced level of rate changes are due to declines in frequency and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. For Allstate brand standard auto, 37 the countrywide rate change was 1.3% and the state specific rate change was 3.3% during 2004. For Encompass brand standard auto, the countrywide rate change was 2.8% and the state specific rate change was 4.4% during 2004. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in average premium. Renewal business written premium declined in 2005 as the decline in PIF more than offset increases in average premium. The increases in average premium are primarily due to rate activity, the effect of which is declining due to a decrease in rate change activity. PIF declined in 2005 due to insufficient new business to offset declines due to decreases in the renewal ratio. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 and renewal business premiums written decreased in 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in new PIF and rate activity. We expect the rate of decline in Encompass brand standard auto PIF to continue to moderate as we pursue growth opportunities in this channel. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for standard auto during 2005. These rate changes do not reflect initial rates filed for new insurance subsidiaries. # of States Countrywide(%)(1) State Specific(%)(2) Allstate brand(3) 23 0.4 1.0 Encompass brand 22 0.7 1.6 (1)Represents the impact in the states where rate changes were approved during 2005 as a percentage of total countrywide prior year end premiums written.

Allstate brand non standard auto new business premiums declined during 2005 due to lower new business production as agencies continued to focus on our standard auto business. Declines in Allstate brand renewal business premiums during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower renewal PIF and average premium. Renewal PIF decreased because new business production in prior periods was insufficient to make up for an inherently low renewal ratio in this business. The decline in average premium during 2005 when compared to 2004 is due to mix of business and a decrease in rates. In 2004, the increase in average premium declined due to the decrease in rate activity. 38 Encompass brand (Deerbrook) non standard premiums written decreased in 2005 and 2004 primarily because of declines in new business.

Allstate brand homeowners new business premiums written declined in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to our catastrophe risk management actions. The increase in Allstate brand homeowners 40 PIF as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. PIF is also being impacted by the non renewal of approximately 95,000 of Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ("Allstate Floridian") policies to Universal or approximately 1% of Allstate brand homeowners PIF. These policies non renewed at a rate of 13% in third quarter of 2005 and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2005, and are expected to non renew at a rate of 23% in the first quarter of 2006, 28% in the second quarter of 2006 and 12% in the third quarter of 2006. The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 was the result of the increases in new business due to a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and increased customer loyalty. The increases in Allstate brand homeowners average premium during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums, primarily related to increases in insured value along with rate actions taken in the current and prior years. Encompass brand homeowners new business premiums written increased in 2005 and 2004 due to increases in PIF and average premium. Increases in Encompass brand homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year and increases in insured value.

The decline was the result of increased catastrophe losses, lower favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and increased current year claim severity, partly offset by increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and lower operating costs. In 2005, claims and claims expense and the claims and claims expense ratio include the effect of $120 million or 0.4 points related to an accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit challenging our overtime exemption under California wage and hour laws ("accrual for litigation"). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A. Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $2.47 billion during 2004 compared to $1.90 billion in 2003. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity. Claims and claims expense during 2005 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $5.00 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. These estimates include net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. For a further discussion of catastrophe losses, see page 45. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2005 and 2004 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Maintenance and Repair price index and the Parts & Equipment price index. In 2005 and 2004, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends. Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. In 2005 and 2004, we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. 42 Loss ratios are a measure of profitability. Loss ratios by product, and expense and combined ratios by brand, are shown in the following table. These ratios are defined on page 30.

The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity more than offsetting higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included the impact of an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. The Encompass brand standard auto loss ratio in 2005 was also unfavorably impacted as a result of higher current year claim severity partially offset by lower claim frequency. Standard auto loss ratio declined 5.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 3.9 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to decreases in premiums earned, higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity partly offset by lower claim frequency. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Encompass brand decreased 8.6 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio declined 11.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.9 points for Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve 43 reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Auto loss ratio increased 1.7 points for the Allstate brand and 3.9 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes being more than offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. Auto loss ratio declined 6.3 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, lower claim frequency and higher premiums earned for Allstate brand, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Homeowners loss ratio increased 43.3 points for the Allstate brand and 14.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses, unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher current year claim severity partially offset by higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Homeowners loss ratio increased 4.2 points for the Allstate brand and declined 13.0 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, excluding catastrophes for the Allstate brand, and higher current year claim severity. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection decreased 0.3 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 primarily due to a reduction in employee incentives due to lower financial results for 2005. In 2004, the ratio increased due to higher amortization of DAC resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table. Allstate brand Encompass brand 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Amortization of DAC 14.7 14.5 13.9 20.5 19.6 19.1 Other costs and expenses 8.7 9.2 9.3 9.1 9.0 9.9 Restructuring and related charges 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.3 Total expense ratio 23.5 23.9 23.5 29.9 29.0 29.3 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximates the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 24.0 in 2005, 24.3 in 2004 and 23.9 in 2003. The expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to CNA Financial Corporation, which ended in the fourth quarter of 2005. The licensing fees were 1.5% of premiums written by independent agencies appointed by CNA for a period of six years after acquisition of the CNA personal lines business ("Encompass") in 1999. Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $40 million and $6 million, respectively. 44 DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting and direct mail solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the time frames in which premiums are earned. The balance of DAC for each product type at December 31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted. Historical Catastrophe Experience Since the beginning of 1992, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property Liability loss ratio was 7.6 points. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), FHCF or placed with a third party, such as hurricane coverage in Hawaii. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California earthquakes, on our Property Liability loss ratio was 6.1 points since the beginning of 1992. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years 1992 through 2005 is shown in the following table. Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, and losses from California earthquakes Eastern and gulf coast states 38.0 31.4 All other 22.0 14.3 Total 30.7 23.7 Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Limitations include our participation in various state facilities, such as the CEA, which provides insurance for California earthquake losses; the FHCF, which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses; and other state 45 facilities, such as wind pools. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our participation, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities. Hurricanes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Policies in force attributable to counties along the eastern and gulf coasts, including the entire state of Florida, represented approximately 25% of total homeowners policies in force during 2005. Generally, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas. Examples of actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 to reduce our exposure in these areas include purchasing reinsurance as discussed below; a moratorium on personal homeowners new business writings and the non renewal of select policies in eight coastal counties in the state of New York; a definitive agreement with Universal whereby a portion of existing customers in Florida will have new policies available when their policies expire and are not renewed; and exiting the commercial property market in Florida beginning in May 2005. We have also received approval for homeowners premium rate increases in the state of Florida averaging 7.9% implemented in August 2005, followed by an additional rate increase averaging 18.2%, implemented in October 2005. The October rate increase is subject to review by the state regulator to the extent that the actual expense ratios, including the cost of additional reinsurance to be acquired, are less than estimated expense ratios in the rate increase filings. Further, the rate increase is subject to refund or credits to the extent the approved rate is determined to have resulted in an excessive rate for the 12 month period starting October 1, 2005. While hurricanes can also be devastating to inland areas, we anticipate that our actions will be less extensive in these areas and they will be determined based on an assessment of our local exposure. Earthquakes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. Premiums written attributable to earthquake coverage totaled approximately $60 million in 2005. Earthquake coverage is generally written as an option or as a standard covered peril depending on policy language requirements in each state. Our current strategy is to significantly reduce earthquake exposure by limiting earthquake coverage in policies, pursuing alternative markets for placement of this coverage and purchasing reinsurance. The implementation of the alternative markets strategy is subject to the identification and negotiation of arrangements with other companies to allow our agencies to place the coverage. Our initial focus will be in states with the highest earthquake exposure. Examples of actions we have already taken in these areas include our discontinuation of writing earthquake coverage in California following the formation of the CEA in 1996, allowing our agencies to place new business earthquake coverage with another carrier in the state of South Carolina beginning in 2005 and no longer offering new optional coverage and removing optional coverage from policies in most states beginning in 2006. We also continue to evaluate purchases of reinsurance including coverage for potential assessments from the CEA. We anticipate that implementation of limitations on new and renewal optional earthquake coverage will not adversely impact either auto or homeowners production and that it will cause a relatively immaterial decline in premiums written, but will result in a material reduction of exposure from catastrophic earthquake losses. We also expect that this reduction in exposure will allow for some reduction in our capital requirements. 46  We include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2005, catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and other anticipated recoveries totaled $5.67 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $2.47 billion in 2004 and $1.49 billion in 2003. Of the $5.67 billion of catastrophe losses incurred during 2005, $5.00 billion related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million related to assessments from FL Citizens. Through February 8, 2006, approximately 78% of the property claim counts and 97% of the auto claim counts related to each of these events are closed, and we expect substantially all of our remaining estimated net losses related to the 2005 hurricane season will be paid during 2006. We had $2.89 billion of gross catastrophe related reserves held at December 31, 2005.

Catastrophe claims and claims expense estimates include losses from approximately 103,000 expected claims of which over 93,000 claims have been reported.

In addition, Allstate Floridian has reinsurance on certain personal homeowners policies in Florida with Universal. For further discussion of these reinsurance and other recoveries, see the reinsurance section of the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A and Note 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2005 our longstanding contract with Pilot Catastrophe Services ("Pilot") for additional claims adjustors aided in our ability to complete more timely claims payments. Catastrophe losses also include $120 million of accruals for two assessments from FL Citizens and $34 million from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("LA Citizens"). These entities were created by their respective states to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market and can levy an assessment on participating companies for a financial deficit. After paying assessments, we expect that our subsidiaries will be able to recoup them in part through premiums written in the state. These recoupments will be recorded as an offset to catastrophe losses in the period that the related premiums are written and are expected to be primarily recorded over the next two years. For further discussion of these assessments, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Claims and claims expense during 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This estimate includes net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. Allstate Protection Outlook We expect to see continued growth of Allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased PIF resulting from increases in the number of agencies representing us, advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty, however total Allstate Protection premiums written will likely be comparable to 2005 levels due to the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on property premiums, including the impacts of increased ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance. We expect to experience a slowing rate of decline in our non standard auto product and Encompass brand standard auto while maintaining profitability in these businesses. We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results, however this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions including purchases of reinsurance. We will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for technology and reinsurance. For example, there will be an investment in claims technology of approximately $95 million over 2006, 2007 and 2008 as a result of our claims system reengineering. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including increases in benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments. 49 DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. As part of its responsibilities, this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations. Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums written $ (2 ) $ 4 $ 12 Premiums earned $ 1 $ 6 $ 13 Claims and claims expense (167 ) (635 ) (574 ) Other costs and expenses (9 ) (9 ) (10 ) Underwriting loss $ (175 ) $ (638 ) $ (571 ) During 2005, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $139 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $18 million, $22 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $463 million, and an increase of $136 million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. See the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A for a more detailed discussion. Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. We are somewhat encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity seems to be slowing, perhaps reflecting various recent state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims. In addition, we continue to monitor the possibility of federal legislation related to these claims. PROPERTY LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 1.0% in 2005 when compared to last year, after increasing 5.7% in 2004 when compared to 2003. These increases were due to higher income from partnerships and higher fixed income portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. 50 The following table presents the average pretax investment yields for the year ended December 31. 2005(1)(3) 2004(2)(3) 2003(2)(3) Fixed income securities: tax exempt 5.2 % 5.4 % 5.5 % Fixed income securities: tax exempt equivalent 7.6 7.9 7.8 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.0 5.2 5.5 Equity securities 4.8 4.6 4.4 Mortgage loans 5.5 5.5 7.7 Total portfolio 5.0 5.1 5.3 (1)Pretax yield is calculated as investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the investment balances at the beginning and end of period and any interim quarters.

Property Liability Investment Outlook As a result of our recent years catastrophe experience and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation in 2005, investment income for 2006 is expected to slightly decline relative to the prior year due to lower cash flows from operating activities causing a decline in portfolio balances. Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate due to the impact of the current interest rate environment. PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These 51 reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date. Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three year or two year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate. Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates. Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December 31, 2005, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $120 million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $120 million. For a further description of our 52 reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.

Unfavorable homeowner reserve reestimates in 2005 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected. In 2005, reestimates included $66 million related to 2004 hurricanes of which $31 million was the FL Citizens assessment that was accruable in 2005. These were offset primarily by late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2004 were primarily due to late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. Other lines reserve reestimates in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily the result of claim severity development different than anticipated in previous estimates. 54 Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected. The Allstate brand experienced $209 million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2003. This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. These trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below.

Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders. Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2005 and for asbestos and other discontinued lines in 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 1,464 $ 139 $ 1,079 $ 463 $ 635 $ 520 Environmental Claims 232 2 257 304 2 Other Discontinued Lines 631 26 501 172 491 52 Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 2,327 $ 167 $ 1,837 $ 635 $ 1,430 $ 574 Underwriting (loss) income (175 ) (638 ) (571 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (95.4 )% (99.5 )% (100.5 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2005, 2004 and 2003, totaling $139 million, $463 million and $520 million, respectively, were primarily for products related coverage. They were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims, excess policyholders with new claims, and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions, as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported. These trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry, which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity, and bankruptcy actions. During 2004, reserve reestimates, including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, included $150 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $22 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s, including reinsurance on 57 primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature. Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our direct excess business. Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro rata coverage. Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country. 58 The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 Incurred claims and claims expense 200 139 971 463 800 520 Claims and claims expense paid (422 ) (230 ) (127 ) (78 ) (121 ) (76 ) Ending reserves $ 2,205 $ 1,373 $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 Annual survival ratio 5.2 6.0 19.1 18.8 13.1 14.2 3 year survival ratio 9.9 10.7 16.1 13.9 11.1 10.9 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 Incurred claims and claims expense 3 2 1 2 Claims and claims expense paid (32 ) (29 ) (35 ) (25 ) (78 ) (49 ) Ending reserves $ 252 $ 205 $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 Annual survival ratio 7.9 7.2 8.1 9.1 4.0 5.2 3 year survival ratio 5.2 6.0 4.3 5.0 4.3 5.0 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 5.4 6.1 16.7 16.4 9.5 10.7 3 year survival ratio 9.0 9.7 12.5 11.2 8.8 8.9 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 68.0 % 61.6 % 59.9 % The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. In 2005, the asbestos survival ratio declined due to an increase in claims paid, primarily due to commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn caused reduced reserve levels. In 2004, the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. In 2004, the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments. 59  The total commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2005, 2004 and 2003 excluding these commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 322 $ 176 $ 32 $ 22 $ 54 $ 33 Annual survival ratio 21.1 24.9 25.2 25.5 22.7 24.2 3 year survival ratio 24.7 26.8 31.7 28.4 21.9 22.2 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 13 $ 13 $ 22 $ 14 $ 42 $ 24 Annual survival ratio 13.7 13.1 21.7 20.7 8.4 10.0 3 year survival ratio 13.1 13.2 9.7 10.0 7.7 8.4 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 335 $ 189 $ 54 $ 36 $ 96 $ 57 Annual survival ratio 20.0 22.2 24.8 24.7 17.7 19.0 3 year survival ratio 22.6 23.6 25.6 22.6 16.7 16.9 Our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy as it determines a more normalized survival ratio by measuring the impact over three years and by excluding from payments amounts no longer carried in the reserves and not viewed in this ratio as a continuing payment level. Now at 26.8 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2005, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2005 would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately $33 million. Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions) Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Direct policyholders: Primary 46 $ 18 1 % 52 $ 23 2 % 52 $ 28 3 % Excess 333 180 13 322 297 20 286 201 19 Total 379 198 14 % 374 320 22 % 338 229 22 % Assumed reinsurance 215 16 222 15 191 17 IBNR claims 960 70 922 63 659 61 Total net reserves $ 1,373 100 % $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,079 100 % Total reserve additions $ 139 $ 463 $ 514 (1) (1)Excludes a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. 60 During the last three years, 186 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 87 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 99 during the period. The 99 increase comprised 5 from 2005, 36 from 2004 and 58 from 2003. The increase of 5 from 2005 included 37 new policyholders reporting new claims and 32 policyholders claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2005, totaled $139 million and included the following factors: Direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by $5 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis. Direct excess insurance net reserves decreased by $117 million as a result of significant settlement activity including two major settlements during the fourth quarter of 2005. Assumed reinsurance net reserves decreased by $7 million due to a significant commutation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 New Claims(1) 256 361 265 (1)New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies. IBNR net reserves increased by $38 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2005 IBNR represented 70% of total asbestos reserves, 7 points higher than at December 31, 2004. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new insurance policyholders and ceding companies. Our non products case reserves represent approximately 5% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure. For environmental exposures, a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table. Number of Claims 2005 2004 2003 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 8,630 8,210 6,900 New 1,635 1,959 2,267 Total closed (1,459 ) (1,539 ) (957 ) Pending, end of year 8,806 8,630 8,210 Closed without payment 829 805 594 61 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 5,775 6,100 7,352 New 689 1,125 954 Total closed (1,568 ) (1,450 ) (2,206 ) Pending, end of year 4,896 5,775 6,100 Closed without payment 1,115 1,006 1,776 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Other mass torts $ 203 $ 205 $ 234 Workers compensation 151 152 132 Commercial and other 245 274 135 Other discontinued lines $ 599 $ 631 $ 501 Other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures. We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2006, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves. Property Liability Reinsurance Ceded For Allstate Protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, while lessening earnings volatility and improving shareholder return, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company. We purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. We also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, and have 62 purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts. Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Industry pools and facilities $ 2,811 $ 2,217 $ 2,241 $ 1,596 Asbestos and environmental 2,457 2,708 1,003 1,045 Other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 16,849 14,413 126 86 Total Property Liability $ 22,117 $ 19,338 $ 3,370 $ 2,727 When purchasing reinsurance, we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $213 million and $230 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represent 17.3% and 16.9%, respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances. 63 The largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

At December 31, 2005, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property Liability reinsurer was in excess of $29 million. Allstate sells and administers policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). Ceded premiums earned include $199 million, $181 million and $169 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and ceded losses incurred include $3.30 billion, $171 million and $64 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for this program. Under the arrangement, the Federal Government is obligated to pay all claims. The NFIP has no impact on our net income or financial position and is included net of ceded premiums and losses with our other personal lines business. We receive expense allowances from NFIP as reimbursement for underwriting administration, commission, claims management and adjuster fees. These policies are not included in any of our core business statistics such as PIF, new net premiums written, loss ratio, combined ratio or catastrophe losses. We enter into certain inter company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. An affiliate of the company, Allstate Texas Lloyds ("ATL"), a syndicate insurance company cedes 100% of its business net of reinsurance with external parties to AIC. At December 31, 2005, ATL has $250 million of reinsurance recoverable primarily related to losses incurred from Hurricane Rita. 64 Our Allstate Protection catastrophe reinsurance has been designed to coordinate coverage provided under various treaties. As discussed below, our reinsurance program is composed of treaties that provide coverage for state specific personal lines catastrophe exposures, with various retentions and limits. In addition, in 2006 the program includes an aggregate excess agreement that limits Allstate Protections personal lines property and auto catastrophe losses for storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes in excess of $2 billion in aggregated losses up to the treaty limit of $2 billion, excluding Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from the state specific treaties are excluded when determining the retention of the aggregate excess agreement. Multi year individual state reinsurance treaties cover personal property excess catastrophe losses in seven states: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas through May 31, 2008 and Florida through May 31, 2007 (the "multi year treaties"). The annual retentions and limits on these treaties in effect since June 1, 2005 are shown in the following table. State % Placed Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Connecticut 95 $100 $ 200 New Jersey 95 100 100 New York 90 750 1,000 North Carolina 10 80 175 South Carolina 10 97 435 Texas(2) 95 320 550 Florida 90 Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(1) 900 (1)The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. (2)Reinsurance is recoverable by ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. The annual retentions and limits on the agreements expected to be in place during 2006 are shown in the following table. For further discussion of these reinsurance agreements, see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. 65  Effective Date % Placed Reinstatement/Limits Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Aggregate excess(1) 6/1/2006 95 None $2,000 $ 2,000 California fire following(2) 2/1/2006 95 2 limits over 28 month term and as noted above 500 1,500 Multi year(3): 6/1/2005 (as revised effective 6/1/2006) Connecticut 95 2 limits over 3 year term 100 200 New Jersey 95 1 reinstatement over 3 year term with reinstatement premium required 100 200 New York(4) 90 2 limits over 3 year term 750 1,000 Texas(5) 95 2 limits for each year over 3 year term 320 650 Florida 90 2 limits over 2 year term Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(6) 900 New Jersey(7) 6/1/2006 95 Excess of New Jersey Multi year treaty 300 (1)Aggregate Excess Agreement This agreement is effective 6/1/2006 for 1 year and covers storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes for the Allstate and Encompass brand personal lines auto and property business countrywide except for Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from our California fire following agreement, multi year treaties and any new New Jersey agreement are excluded when determining the retention of this agreement. (2)California Fire Following Agreement This agreement is effective 2/1/2006 and expires 5/31/2008. This agreement covers Allstate and Encompass brand personal property losses in California for fires following earthquakes. This agreement provides in total $3 billion of coverage for all qualifying losses except when a qualifying loss occurrence exceeds $2 billion, then for 21 days no additional recovery can occur for any losses within the same seismic geographically affected area. (3)Multi year Treaties These treaties have been in effect since 6/1/2005 and cover the Allstate brand personal property catastrophe losses, expiring 5/31/2008, except for the treaty in Florida. The Florida treaty provides coverage for property policies written by Allstate Floridian and it expires 5/31/2007. This chart reflects our expectation that we will expand coverage limits by $100 million per year on the New Jersey and Texas treaties effective 6/1/2006, and that we expect to terminate the existing treaties in North Carolina and South Carolina on 5/31/2006. The retentions, limits and or reinsurance premiums on these treaties are also subject to annual remeasurements on their anniversary dates. (4)Two separate reinsurance treaties provide coverage for catastrophe risks in the State of New York: AIC has a $500,000,000 retention and a $550,000,000 limit, and Allstate Indemnity Company has a $250,000,000 retention and a $450,000,000 limit. (5)The Texas treaty is with ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. (6)FHCF The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. These estimates are subject to annual remeasurements at the beginning of the FHCF fiscal year of 6/1. This is an annual program with a first season and second season coverage provision. (7)New Jersey Agreement This agreement is being contemplated, but has not yet been placed. This agreement is expected to be effective 6/1/2006. 66 We anticipate that the total cost of these agreements will be approximately $600 million per year or $150 million per quarter. This represents an increase of approximately $400 million per year or $100 million per quarter over our current cost, once these agreements are fully placed and effective. Based on the effective dates of these agreements, our costs are expected to be approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2006, $100 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. We will aggressively seek regulatory approvals, despite the challenging regulatory environment in each state, to include reinsurance costs in our premium rates in order to mitigate the impact of this increase. We currently expect that this level or a similar level of reinsurance coverage will be purchased or renewed for 2007. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Allstate Financial revenues increased 7.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. Higher net investment income, increased contract charges and higher net realized capital gains, were partially offset by lower premiums. Net income improved $170 million to $416 million in 2005 from $246 million in 2004 due primarily to a $175 million after tax charge in 2004 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related primarily to guarantees on variable annuities. Investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Contractholder fund deposits totaled $12.38 billion for 2005 compared to $13.88 billion in 2004. The decline of $1.50 billion was primarily the result of lower deposits on deferred fixed annuities and, to a lesser extent, institutional products. Paid intercompany dividends totaling $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 in conjunction with capital efficiency efforts. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a major provider of life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Allstate Financials mission is to assist financial services professionals in meeting their clients financial protection, retirement and investment needs by providing top tier products delivered with reliable and efficient service. We are pursuing the following actions and strategies to improve Allstate Financials return on equity: maintaining and developing focused top tier products, deepening distribution partner relationships, improving our cost structure through scale and efficiencies, advancing our enterprise risk management program and leveraging the strength of the Allstate brand name across products and distribution channels. The execution of our business strategies has and may continue to involve simplifying our business model and focusing on those products and distribution relationships where we can secure strong leadership positions while generating acceptable returns. This may require modifying the number and selection of products marketed (for example, through such actions as our exit from the guaranteed investment contract market and the long term care product market and the sale of our direct response distribution business in 2004); terminating underperforming distribution relationships; merging or disposing of non strategic legal entities (such as the merger of Glenbrook Life and Annuity Company into Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") in 2005 and the planned sales of five legal entities); reducing policy administration software systems; and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. 67 Our individual retail product line includes a wide variety of products designed to meet the financial protection, retirement and investment needs of our customers. Individual retail products include traditional life, interest sensitive life, supplemental accident and health insurance, variable life, fixed and variable annuities and funding agreements backing retail medium term notes. Banking products and services are also offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. Individual retail products are sold through a variety of distribution channels including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents (including master brokerage agencies and workplace enrolling agents), and financial service firms such as banks, broker/dealers and specialized structured settlement brokers. Allstate Bank products can also be obtained directly through the Internet and a toll free number. Our institutional product line consists primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. Summarized financial data for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Net investment income 3,830 3,410 3,233 Realized capital gains and losses 19 1 (85 ) Total revenues 5,898 5,483 5,452 Costs and expenses Life and annuity contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2,403 ) (2,001 ) (1,846 ) Amortization of DAC (629 ) (591 ) (538 ) Operating costs and expenses (632 ) (634 ) (672 ) Restructuring and related charges (2 ) (5 ) (7 ) Total costs and expenses (5,281 ) (4,849 ) (4,914 ) Loss on disposition of operations (13 ) (24 ) (46 ) Income tax expense (188 ) (189 ) (170 ) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax 416 421 322 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (17 ) Net income $ 416 $ 246 $ 305 Investments $ 75,233 $ 72,530 $ 62,895 Separate accounts assets 15,235 14,377 13,425 Investments, including Separate accounts assets $ 90,468 $ 86,907 $ 76,320 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life, immediate annuities with life contingencies, accident and health and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and institutional products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues. 68 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Premiums Traditional life $ 282 $ 337 $ 402 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 197 316 413 Accident and health and other 439 392 550 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Interest sensitive life 786 729 688 Fixed annuities 65 52 37 Variable annuities 280 246 206 Institutional products 8 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 (1)To conform to the current period presentation, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified. The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 387 $ 395 $ 319 Independent agents 387 356 373 Specialized brokers 141 243 390 Other 3 51 283 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Allstate agencies 521 462 440 Independent agents 305 301 279 Broker dealers 223 199 172 Banks 53 35 15 Specialized brokers 26 27 30 Other 3 3 3 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Total premiums decreased 12.2% in 2005 compared to 2004 as lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies and traditional life products more than offset higher premiums on accident, health and other premiums. Premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies declined primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to improve our returns on new business and reflect our current expectations of mortality. Our new pricing has led to a shift in our sales mix from immediate annuities with life contingencies to immediate annuities without life contingencies, which are accounted for as deposits rather than as premiums. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily due to the absence of certain premiums in 2005 resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution 69 business in 2004. The increase in accident, health and other premiums was primarily attributable to higher underwriting retention. Total premiums decreased 23.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business, which resulted in lower accident and health and other premiums and traditional life premiums. Additionally, 2004 reflects lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies as underwriting actions taken in 2003 reduced the maximum premium received on individual contracts sold. Contract charges increased 10.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life, variable annuities and, to a lesser extent, fixed annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges were attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were primarily the result of higher account values and participation fees. Fixed annuity contract charges in 2005 reflect higher surrender charges compared with the prior year. Contract charges increased 9.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life and variable annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting contract charges, surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were the result of increased average account values during 2004, reflecting positive investment results during 2003 and 2004. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 175 basis points in 2004 from 166 basis points in 2003 driven by increases in fees charged for our variable annuity benefits on the Allstate Advisor product in addition to a higher percentage of our in force contracts providing these benefits. Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products, such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. 70 The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 55,709 $ 47,071 $ 40,751 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) 421 Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 5,926 7,322 5,266 Institutional products (primarily funding agreements) 3,773 3,987 2,713 Interest sensitive life 1,404 1,375 1,074 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 395 495 893 Bank and other deposits 883 701 681 Total deposits 12,381 13,880 10,627 Interest credited 2,404 1,991 1,846 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Maturities of institutional products (3,090 ) (2,518 ) (2,163 ) Benefits (984 ) (729 ) (505 ) Surrenders and partial withdrawals (5,098 ) (3,438 ) (2,728 ) Contract charges (698 ) (655 ) (622 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (339 ) (412 ) (416 ) Fair value hedge adjustments for institutional products (289 ) 38 131 Other adjustments 44 60 150 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (10,454 ) (7,654 ) (6,153 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 60,040 $ 55,709 $ 47,071 (1)The increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of Statement of Position No. 03 1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03 1") reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds, the reclassification of deferred sales inducements ("DSI") from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and other guarantees provided under fixed annuity, variable annuity and interest sensitive life contracts. Lower contractholder deposits and increased surrenders and partial withdrawals as well as higher institutional product maturities contributed to a reduction in the growth rate of contractholder funds in 2005 compared to 2004. Average contractholder funds increased 13.1% in 2005 compared to a 16.6% increase in 2004. Contractholder deposits decreased 10.8% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower deposits on fixed annuities. Fixed annuity deposits declined 19.1% in 2005 as lower deposits on traditional deferred fixed annuities and market value adjusted annuities were partially offset by increased deposits on immediate annuities without life contingencies. The decline in fixed annuity deposits resulted from reduced consumer demand relative to certificates of deposit and other short term investments due to increases in short term interest rates without corresponding increases in longer term rates, and pricing actions to increase fixed annuity product returns. A continuation of the current interest rate environment may limit the level of future fixed annuity deposits. Institutional product deposits decreased 5.4% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our institutional business sales remain opportunistic and, as such, institutional product deposits were intermittent during the year. 71 Contractholder deposits increased 30.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to greater issuances of fixed annuities, interest sensitive life policies and retail and institutional funding agreements. Fixed annuity deposits increased 39.0% in 2004 compared to 2003 due to strong consumer demand, competitive pricing and effective distribution efforts in our bank channel. Institutional product deposits increased 47.0% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely due to favorable market conditions for our funding agreements and the broadening of our customer base through the development and launch of our new Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") registered program in the second quarter of 2004 and our new registered retail funding agreement program in the fourth quarter. The registered programs generated $1.74 billion of new funding agreement deposits during 2004 including $85 million in retail funding agreement deposits. Surrenders and partial withdrawals increased 48.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 driven mostly by higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities due to a portion of these contracts entering a 30 45 day window in which there were no surrender charges or market value adjustments. The lack of surrender charges and market value adjustments combined with the interest rate environment, which included a relatively small difference between short term and long term interest rates, caused contractholders to choose competing short term investment alternatives. The withdrawal rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 11.6%, 9.3% and 8.6%, respectively, based on the beginning of period contractholder funds balance excluding institutional product reserves. Surrenders and withdrawals may vary with changes in interest rates and equity market conditions and the aging of our in force contracts. Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 14,377 $ 13,425 $ 11,125 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) (204 ) Variable annuity and life deposits 1,877 1,763 2,284 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (395 ) (495 ) (893 ) Net deposits 1,482 1,268 1,391 Investment results 1,060 1,348 2,393 Contract charges (283 ) (256 ) (220 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 339 412 416 Surrenders and benefits (1,740 ) (1,616 ) (1,680 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 15,235 $ 14,377 $ 13,425 (1)The decrease in separate accounts due to the adoption of SOP 03 1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds. Separate accounts liabilities increased 6.0% as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. This is compared to an increase of 7.1% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which separate accounts liabilities increased was primarily attributable to less favorable market performance and increased surrenders and benefits, partially offset by higher net deposits. Net variable annuity and life deposits increased 16.9% in 2005 compared to 2004 and declined 8.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. Variable product deposits vary with equity market conditions and consumer preferences related to our product features. Variable annuity contractholders often allocate a 72 significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds. Net investment income increased 12.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily the result of increased portfolio balances and, to a lesser extent, increased yields on floating rate assets due to higher short term interest rates and increased income on partnership interests, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities. In 2004, the increase compared to 2003 was due to higher portfolio balances partially offset by lower portfolio yields. Higher portfolio balances in both years resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities, institutional funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies. Investment balances as of December 31, 2005, increased 3.7% from December 31, 2004 and increased 15.3% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which investments increased in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a lesser increase in contractholder funds and a decline in unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities in 2005 compared with a slight increase in 2004. Changes in portfolio yields are primarily driven by purchases, including reinvestments, of fixed income securities with yields higher or lower than the current portfolio average as well as significant changes in short term interest rates. Net income analysis is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Net investment income 3,830 3,410 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 49 23 Contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (1,956 ) (1,846 ) Gross margin 1,998 1,957 1,863 Amortization of DAC and DSI (545 ) (498 ) (492 ) Operating costs and expenses (632 ) (634 ) (672 ) Restructuring and related charges (2 ) (5 ) (7 ) Income tax expense (260 ) (269 ) (243 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax 12 (3 ) (53 ) DAC and DSI amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses, after tax (103 ) (89 ) (30 ) Reclassification of periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, after tax (40 ) (32 ) (15 ) Loss on disposition of operations, after tax (12 ) (6 ) (29 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (17 ) Net income $ 416 $ 246 $ 305 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. 73 Gross margin, a non GAAP measure, represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges, net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds excluding amortization of DSI. We reclassify periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments into gross margin to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, replicated assets or product attributes (e.g. net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds) and by doing so, appropriately reflect trends in product performance. We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financials life insurance and financial product portfolio. Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin. Gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business: investment margin, benefit margin, and contract charges and fees. We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins. Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financials GAAP net income in the previous table. 74  The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following table. 2005 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 918 $ $ 918 Contract charges 631 500 1,131 Net investment income 3,830 3,830 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 63 Contract benefits (530 ) (1,085 ) (1,615 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (2,329 ) $ 1,034 $ 464 $ 500 $ 1,998 2004(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,045 $ $ 1,045 Contract charges 562 465 1,027 Net investment income 3,410 3,410 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 49 49 Contract benefits (533 ) (1,085 ) (1,618 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,956 ) (1,956 ) $ 970 $ 522 $ 465 $ 1,957 2003(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,365 $ $ 1,365 Contract charges 535 404 939 Net investment income 3,233 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 23 23 Contract benefits (517 ) (1,334 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,846 ) (1,846 ) $ 893 $ 566 $ 404 $ 1,863 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. (3)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. In connection therewith, contract charges related to guaranteed minimum death, income, accumulation and withdrawal benefits on variable annuities have been reclassified to benefit margin from maintenance charges. Additionally, amounts previously presented as maintenance charges and surrender charges are now presented in the aggregate as contract charges and fees. Further, the Allstate Workplace Division margins were conformed. These reclassifications did not result in a change in gross margin. 75 Gross margin increased 2.1% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.0% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in both periods was the result of higher investment margin and contract charges and fees, partially offset by lower benefit margin. Investment margin is a component of gross margin, both of which are non GAAP measures. Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. Amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating investment margin. We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financials profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period. Investment margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Annuities $ 683 $ 623 $ 546 Life insurance 219 212 231 Institutional products 122 121 107 Bank and other 10 14 9 Total investment margin $ 1,034 $ 970 $ 893 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Investment margin increased 6.6% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to growth in our fixed annuity business, partially offset by lower weighted average investment spreads on interest sensitive life and immediate annuities. Investment margin increased 8.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. As of December 31, 2005, 71% of our interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, had a guaranteed crediting rate of 3% or higher. Of these contracts, 79% have crediting rates that were at the minimum guaranteed rate at December 31, 2005. The approximate difference between the weighted average crediting rate and the average guaranteed rate on interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, was 46 basis points as of December 31, 2005 compared with 52 basis points as of December 31, 2004 and 70 basis points as of December 31, 2003. The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Benefit margin represents life and life contingent immediate annuity premiums, cost of insurance contract charges and variable annuity contract charges for contract guarantees less contract benefits. Benefit margin excludes the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin. We use the benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financials underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period. Benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Life insurance $ 544 $ 572 $ 654 Annuities (80 ) (50 ) (88 ) Total benefit margin $ 464 $ 522 $ 566 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Benefit margin declined 11.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our life insurance and annuity business contributed equally to the decline in 2005. The decline in our annuity benefit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and an increase in variable annuity contract benefits. The decline in our life insurance benefit margin was primarily due to the absence of margin on certain products resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the prior year and modestly unfavorable mortality experience on our traditional life business, partially offset by growth in our life insurance in force. Benefit margin decreased 7.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. This decline was primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and unfavorable mortality experience on life contingent immediate annuities, partially offset by an improved benefit margin on life insurance products and lower contract benefits related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuities. 77 As required by SOP 03 1, as of January 1, 2004, a reserve was established for death and income benefits provided under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on certain interest sensitive life contracts and fixed annuities. For variable annuities, the reserve includes GMDBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIBs"). Annuity benefit margin will continue to be adversely impacted by certain closed blocks of life contingent immediate annuities for which benefit payments are anticipated to extend beyond their original pricing expectations. The annuity benefit margin in future periods will fluctuate based on the timing of annuitant deaths on these life contingent immediate annuities and the annual evaluation of assumptions used in our valuation models for variable and fixed annuity guarantees. Amortization of DAC and DSI, excluding amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, increased 9.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher gross margin. DAC and DSI amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, after tax, increased $14 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased realized capital gains on investments supporting certain fixed annuities. In the first quarter of 2005, we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of the assumptions used in our valuation models for all investment products, including variable and fixed annuities and interest sensitive and variable life products, which resulted in net DAC and DSI amortization acceleration of $7 million (commonly referred to as "DAC and DSI unlocking"). The DAC and DSI unlocking includes amortization acceleration on fixed annuities of $62 million and $3 million on interest sensitive and variable life products, partially offset by amortization deceleration on variable annuities of $58 million. The amortization acceleration on fixed annuities was primarily due to higher than expected lapses on market value adjusted annuities and faster than anticipated investment portfolio yield declines. The amortization deceleration on variable annuities was mostly attributable to better than anticipated equity market performance and persistency in 2004. In the prior year, the comparable DAC and DSI unlocking was a net acceleration of amortization of $0.5 million, which included deceleration of amortization related to interest sensitive life and acceleration of amortization related to fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC and DSI increased 1.2% during 2004 compared to 2003. The higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities. In 2003, amortization of DAC and DSI included a net acceleration of DAC amortization totaling $89 million and $37 million of DAC amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in 2004. The adoption of SOP 03 1 in 2004 required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of DAC. Because of this new modeling approach, effective January 1, 2004, the variable annuity DAC and DSI assets were reduced by $124 million. This reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 78 The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables.

(2)The impact of adoption of SOP 03 1 includes a write down in variable annuity DAC of $108 million, the reclassification of DSI from DAC to other assets resulting in a decrease to DAC of $44 million, an increase to DAC of $8 million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from DAC to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to DAC of $10 million. (3)The amortization of DAC for interest sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of gross profits, which include realized capital gains and losses. Fluctuations in amortization for these products may result as actual realized capital gains and losses differ from the amounts utilized in the determination of estimated gross profits. Amortization related to realized capital gains and losses was $126 million and $120 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating costs and expenses declined slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased 5.7% in 2004 compared to 2003. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Non deferrable acquisition costs $ 245 $ 256 $ 286 Other operating costs and expenses 387 378 386 Total operating costs and expenses $ 632 $ 634 $ 672 Non deferrable acquisition costs declined 4.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 as the prior year included a $15 million charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. The impact of this charge was partially offset by higher premium taxes and non deferrable commissions in 2005. Other 79 operating costs and expenses increased 2.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a $28 million increase in a liability for future benefits of a previously discontinued benefit plan, partially offset by lower employee and technology expenses reflecting our continuing actions to simplify operations and reduce costs. The decline in total operating costs and expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business. Excluding the impact of the disposition, non deferrable acquisition costs increased due to higher non deferrable renewal commissions; taxes, licenses and fees; and the charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. For other operating costs and expenses, the decline due to the disposition was partially offset by higher technology and employee related expenses. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $19 million and $3 million, respectively. Net realized capital gains and losses are presented in the following table for the years ended December 31.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 49% of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. As of December 31, 2005, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 90% of the mortality risk depending on the length of the term, policy premium guarantees and the date of policy issuance. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2004, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 100% of the mortality risk. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on substantially all of our long term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. 80  The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life contingent contract benefits at December 31, are summarized in the following table. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims (in millions) 2005 2004 Life insurance $ 1,123 $ 1,010 Long term care 412 315 Other 275 271 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,810 $ 1,596 The estimation of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves. Developments in the insurance industry have included consolidation activity between reinsurers, which has resulted in reinsurance risk across the industry being concentrated among fewer companies. In 2005, we increased our percentage of underwriting retention of new term life insurance policies by approximately 10 15% on average depending on product mix. Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by reinsurer as of December 31, are shown in the following table.

We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended December 31, 2005. 81 We enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Allstate Financial Outlook Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. These strategies include continuing to proactively manage capital and focus our product portfolio on products where we can secure market leadership and achieve acceptable returns. We will continue to manage our expenses and improve our operating efficiency. We plan to reinvigorate sales through the Allstate exclusive agencies by further tailoring products for our customers and making it easier for our agents to distribute Allstate Financial products. We prioritize the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of products with the best sustainable growth and margins and to maintain a market presence for fixed annuity and life products in our retail distribution channels. Our institutional products remain opportunistic. INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. Overview and Strategy The Property Liability portfolios investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has produced competitive returns over time, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. We employ a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk/return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest. The models recommended asset allocation, along with duration and liquidity considerations, guides our initial asset allocation. This is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets. Portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. The Allstate Financial portfolios investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital. We believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. We believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time. The portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling, including a strategic asset allocation model, as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. The Corporate and Other portfolios investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure. The portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns. 82 As a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios, we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Portfolio reviews, which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery, are conducted regularly. For more information, see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolios at December 31, 2005 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information.

Cost basis for these securities was $4.48 billion, $325 million, and $68 million for Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively. (3)Balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other. Total investments increased to $118.30 billion at December 31, 2005 from $115.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating activities including increased funds associated with securities lending, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases and decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities. The Property Liability investment portfolio decreased to $39.57 billion at December 31, 2005 from $40.27 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation and payments of catastrophe claims, partially offset by positive cash flows from other operating activities. The Allstate Financial investment portfolio increased to $75.23 billion at December 31, 2005, from $72.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating, and financing activities, partially offset by decreased unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities. The Corporate and Other investment portfolio increased to $3.49 billion at December 31, 2005, from $2.73 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to additional investments made in the portfolio of Kennett Capital, Inc. ("Kennett Capital"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation, the original source of which was dividends from AIC, partially offset by the liquidation of an investment management variable interest entity ("VIE") with investments of $298 million. Total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending activities, funds received in connection with securities repurchase agreements, and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions, decreased to $4.10 billion at December 31, 2005, from $4.85 billion at December 31, 2004. 83 We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. The following table shows total investments, categorized by the method used to determine fair value at December 31, 2005. Investments (in millions) Carrying Value Percent to total Derivative Contracts Fair Value Fair value based on independent market quotations $ 92,291 78.0 % $ 69 Fair value based on models and other valuation methods 13,708 11.6 976 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership and other investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 12,298 10.4 Total $ 118,297 100.0 % $ 1,045 Fixed Income Securities See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income security for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $26.74 billion and 96.6% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Approximately 64.5% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by seven bond insurers and accordingly have a Moodys equivalent rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2005 consisted of approximately 3,500 issues from approximately 2,500 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was approximately 1% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately 8.9% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate bonds totaled $40.13 billion and 90.2% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio contained $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations, 44.2% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $17.41 billion at December 31, 2004. Approximately $15.63 billion or 88.2% of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities. The benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2005, 89.0% of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade. Foreign government securities totaled $2.95 billion and 95.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Mortgage backed securities ("MBS") totaled $9.04 billion at December 31, 2005, all of which were investment grade. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. 84 Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities ("CMBS") totaled $6.99 billion at December 31, 2005. CMBS investments primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages, broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. The CMBS portfolio is subject to credit risk, but unlike other structured products, is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages, whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates. Credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments. Approximately 82.2% of the CMBS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors rating of AAA, the highest rating category, at December 31, 2005. Asset backed securities ("ABS") totaled $8.08 billion at December 31, 2005. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral. In addition, many of the securities in the ABS portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and or insurance. Approximately 65.1% of the ABS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. A portion of the ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since, for example, price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets. The ABS portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations and other bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types, predominately home equity loans, credit card receivables and auto loans. At December 31, 2005, 94.8% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moodys or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch or Dominion; or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available.

The equity securities portfolio was $6.16 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $5.90 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase is attributable to positive cash flows from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.31 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $1.34 billion at December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized losses totaled $22 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $14 million at December 31, 2004. Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in 85 determining whether the securities are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December 31, 2005 totaled $4.58 billion, a decrease of $1.81 billion since December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector are provided in the table below.

The gross unrealized losses in these sectors were primarily company specific and interest rate related. Approximately $33 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio were associated with the automobile industry, which includes direct debt issuances of automobile manufacturers, captive automotive financing companies and automobile parts and equipment suppliers, which are reported above in the consumer goods and financial services sectors. Fixed income security values in the automobile industry were primarily depressed due to company specific conditions. Additionally, approximately $5 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and $7 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were depressed due to company or issue specific conditions and economic issues, including fuel costs. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 86 The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2005. (in millions) NAIC Rating Moodys Equivalent Unrealized Loss Percent to Total Fair Value Percent to Total 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ (396 ) 64.5 % $ 24,025 74.9 % 2 Baa (155 ) 25.2 6,718 21.0 3 Ba (34 ) 5.5 858 2.7 4 B (22 ) 3.6 354 1.1 5 Caa or lower (6 ) 1.0 71 0.2 6 In or near default (1 ) 0.2 31 0.1 Total $ (614 ) 100.0 % $ 32,057 100.0 % The table above includes 57 securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a comparable internal rating, with a fair value totaling $669 million and an unrealized loss of $14 million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, execution of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC, and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating. At December 31, 2005, $551 million, or 89.7%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired. As of December 31, 2005, $63 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 14.3% were in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2005. Included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities, through diversification of the portfolio, and active credit monitoring and portfolio management. The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers.

At December 31, 2005, the consumer goods, communications and technology sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio, which were company and sector specific. We expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate, on a case by case basis, fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list. As a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration and revisions to strategic asset allocations, and certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers, we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 88  The following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance, aging and investment grade classification.

The largest individual unrealized loss was $4 million for category (i) and $5 million for category (ii) as of December 31, 2005. 89 Categories (i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate increases and the markets evaluation of certain sectors. The degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. Categories (iii) and (iv) have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions. All of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment. We expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time. Whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12 months is temporary, additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, one security with an unrealized loss of $3 million met these criteria. The following table contains the individual securities with the largest unrealized losses as of December 31, 2005. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than $3 million or 0.5% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities.

Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future. 90 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December 31. 2005 2004 (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Problem $ 172 $ 188 0.2 % $ 150 $ 153 0.1 % Restructured 33 34 75 75 0.1 Potential problem 178 191 0.2 265 269 0.3 Total net carrying value $ 383 $ 413 0.4 % $ 490 $ 497 0.5 % Cumulative write downs recognized $ 304 $ 351 We have experienced an increase in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily related to the addition of securities to the problem category as a result of company specific issues, including the bankruptcy filings of certain airlines. The decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as restructured and potential problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was primarily related to dispositions. We evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2005 and recorded write downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio. Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Investment write downs $ (55 ) $ (129 ) $ (294 ) Dispositions 619 828 453 Valuation of derivative instruments (95 ) (46 ) 16 Settlement of derivative instruments 80 (62 ) 21 Realized capital gains and losses, pretax 549 591 196 Income tax expense (189 ) (199 ) (62 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax $ 360 $ 392 $ 134 Dispositions in the above table include sales, losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions and other transactions such as calls and prepayments. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. In certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security. Included in investment write downs were $11 million of realized losses related to airline industry holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dispositions included net realized gains on sales of 91 $827 million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of $208 million. The net realized gains were comprised of gross gains of $1.17 billion and gross losses of $341 million. The $341 million in gross losses primarily consisted of $192 million from sales of fixed income securities and $142 million from sales of equity securities. A changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level. A duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view. Tactical duration adjustments within managements approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses and through new purchases. As a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration, realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. This approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation. Because of the level of catastrophe losses experienced during 2005 and the possibility that we may need to have additional cash available to pay claims, we identified a portfolio from which we would consider selecting specific securities to sell to meet these needs. Certain of these securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $34 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in this portfolio was $13.13 billion. Because of an anticipated rise in interest rates, as well as changes in existing market conditions and long term asset return assumptions, certain changes are planned within various portfolios. These included continued asset liability management strategies, on going comprehensive reviews of our portfolios, and changes being made to our strategic asset allocations, including Property Liability duration. In addition, we decided to pursue yield enhancement strategies for the Allstate Financial portfolio. Certain of the securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $174 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in these portfolios was $1.24 billion. Gains from dispositions during 2004 include $90 million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and $49 million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the Allstate Floridian Insurance Company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims. The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $45 million with the largest being $9 million and the smallest being $3 million. None of the $45 million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale. Our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates. No other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on dispositions and 92 writedowns greater than 0.8% of the total gross loss on dispositions and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities.

(2)Holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost. (3)Losses due to a decision to decrease our exposure to two large domestic auto manufacturers and as a result of changing economic circumstances, including the decline in their overall market share. The circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios. Mortgage Loans Our mortgage loan portfolio which is primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio was $8.75 billion at December 31, 2005 and $7.86 billion at December 31, 2004, and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk. We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had no net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2005 and had $1 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short Term Investments Our short term investment portfolio was $3.47 billion and $4.13 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year. We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expense. At December 31, 2005, the amount of securities lending collateral 93 reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of $650 million. This compares to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2004. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. Overview We generate substantial investible funds from our Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business. Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight and investment activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees. For Allstate Financial, its asset liability management ("ALM") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks. ALM focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate investment risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies specify limits, ranges and or targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financials business objectives in light of its product liabilities. We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration and value at risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the ALM organization. This integration results in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return, conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of 94 Allstate Financials product liabilities and supported by the application of advanced risk technology and analytics. Although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest rate sensitive assets and issue interest rate sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations. We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2005, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.50, compared to a 0.84 gap at December 31, 2004. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. Most of our duration gap originates from the Property Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property Liability assets and liabilities. For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy may include using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers. We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $33 million as of December 31, 2005. For over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2005, we held $352 million of cash pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments and did not have any collateral pledged to counterparties. To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions 95 (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.45 billion, compared to $1.79 billion at December 31, 2004. There are $7.04 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments. These assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate. The $7.04 billion of assets excluded from the calculation has decreased from the $7.32 billion reported at December 31, 2004 due to a decrease in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $456 million, compared to a decrease of $427 million at December 31, 2004. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2005, we would recognize realized capital gains totaling $27 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $27 million in realized capital losses in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates. Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. At December 31, 2005, we held approximately $4.97 billion in common stocks and $2.03 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds, non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes), compared to approximately $4.88 billion in common stocks and $1.82 billion in other equity investments at December 31, 2004. Approximately 100.0% and 66.3% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of the Property Liability operations at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 99.8% and 65.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately 0.95, compared to a beta of approximately 0.85 at December 31, 2004. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investments market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 9.5%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 9.5%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2005, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately 96 $667 million, compared to $569 million at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $15.24 billion and $14.38 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $25 million and $24 million less in fee income at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial have a GMDB and customers may have chosen to purchase an enhanced GMDB, a GMIB from 1998 to December 31, 2003, a TrueReturnSM guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("GMAB") beginning in 2004, and a SureIncomeSM guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") beginning in 2005. These guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value. GMDBs are payable upon death. GMIBs may be exercised on or after the tenth year anniversary (not prior to 2008) of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue (not prior to 2012). GMABs guarantee an account value of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements. GMWBs may be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals. GMWBs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to 8% of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit. In January 2004, we established reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03 1. Because of this change in accounting, guarantee payments are now recognized over future periods rather than expensed as paid. For more details about this adopted accounting guidance and the calculation of the related reserves see Notes 2 and 8 of the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $1.52 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2005 and customer surrenders of contracts with in the money GMDBs. In both periods, approximately half of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining half is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in 2003 to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after January 1, 2003. A similar program was established for GMABs in 2004 and for GMWBs in 2005. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December 31, 2005 would increase by an estimated $15 million in 2006. These payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to 97 earnings as paid. Contributions to the reserve for GMDBs would increase by a nominal amount in 2006 in the event of an immediate 10% decline in account values. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model. GMIB contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variable annuity products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue. Accordingly, the earliest date at which benefits could become payable is 2008. Therefore, in the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005 due to equity market declines, contributions to the reserve would be increased by approximately $1 million in 2006. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in GMAB and GMWB contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005, due to equity market declines, there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are hedged, however the reserve for GMABs and GMWBs would be increased by approximately $10 million and $2 million, respectively. In addition to our GMDB, GMIB and GMAB equity risk, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 we had approximately $2.72 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively, in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits. Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable annuity and life contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including real estate funds and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $1.17 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively, in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $538 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $566 million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $455 million and $567 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property Liability business. Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $110 million, compared with an estimated $102 million decrease at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 98 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 34 countries, compared to 32 countries at December 31, 2004. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2005 were to the Canadian dollar (52.4%) and the Euro (14.7%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2004 were to the Canadian dollar (56.5%) and the British pound (11.0%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.2% at December 31, 2005, compared to 28.7% at December 31, 2004. The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents. See Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period, which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Net periodic pension cost in 2006 is estimated to be $331 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2005 and 2004 principally due to decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates, the impact of unfavorable investment returns from prior periods on the market related value of assets, and the amortization of actuarial losses. In each of the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $135 million in 2005 and $121 million in 2004. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poors or at least "Aa" by Moodys on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities. 99  Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $58 million in net periodic pension cost and an $1.08 billion increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2005, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $50 million in net periodic pension cost and a $867 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $45 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by $6 million as of October 31, 2005, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $41 million and a $49 million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. This non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. We made contributions during 2005 sufficient to eliminate a minimum pension liability for one of our qualified pension plans. The minimum pension liability reported at December 31, 2005 relates solely to our unfunded non qualified pension plans. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $38 million in pension cost at October 31, 2005, compared to an increase of $37 million at October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $38 million at October 31, 2005, compared to a decrease of $37 million at October 31, 2004. Changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders equity items $ 18,104 $ 19,208 $ 17,809 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,082 2,615 2,756 Total shareholders equity 20,186 21,823 20,565 Debt 5,300 5,334 5,076 Total capital resources $ 25,486 $ 27,157 $ 25,641 Ratio of debt to shareholders equity 26.3 % 24.4 % 24.7 % Ratio of debt to capital resources 20.8 % 19.6 % 19.8 % 100 Shareholders equity declined in 2005, due to net income being offset by share repurchases, decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders. Shareholders equity increased in 2004 when compared to 2003, as net income was partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. In January 2005, we commenced a $4.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2005, this program had $1.55 billion remaining and is expected to be completed in 2006. Treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity and, since 1995, we have acquired 337 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $12.39 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 84 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Debt decreased in 2005 primarily due to decreases in long term debt partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. In May 2005, we issued $800 million of 5.55% Senior Notes due 2035, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes including to fund the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005, which were repaid at their scheduled maturity, May 1, 2005. In July 2005, we liquidated our consolidated investment management VIE. As a result of the liquidation, long term debt decreased by $279 million. We plan to use existing sources of liquidity to fund the repayment of our $550 million 5.375% senior notes due in 2006. Debt increased in 2004 primarily due to increases in long term borrowings outstanding. We issued $650 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2014, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005 at their scheduled maturity on May 1, 2005. The increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of $412 million related to the deconsolidation of a VIE resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the VIE. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $413 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.22%. Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December 31, 2005. Moodys Standard & Poors A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P 1 A 1 AMB 1 Allstate Insurance Company (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. We have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida. These groups maintain separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other Allstate subsidiaries that are not part of these respective groups. The ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate distinctly to each group. 101 Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a financial strength rating no lower than B+. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company and Encompass Insurance Company of New Jersey, which write auto and homeowners insurance, are rated A by A.M. Best. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company also has a Demotech rating of A". Allstate Floridian, which writes primarily property insurance, has an A.M. Best rating of B+ with a negative outlook, and remains under review currently. The resolution of this review will be influenced by developments prior to the 2006 hurricane season, including Florida regulatory and legislative actions, Allstate and Allstate Floridian management actions, A.M. Bests assessment of the timing and nature of such developments and their view on the amount of capital and risk adjusted capitalization deemed necessary to support the ratings. Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiary, Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company, also have a Demotech rating of A. Encompass Floridian Insurance Company and Encompass Floridian Indemnity Company, both subsidiaries of Allstate Floridian, have Demotech ratings of A. In addition, AIC committed to AFIC to make as much as $375 million of additional capital available until May 31, 2006 under specified circumstances if one or more events reduce AFICs capital to below $272 million initially and to $225 million if subsequent events should occur. In December 2005, $159 million was contributed under this agreement. As of December 31, 2005, AFICs statutory surplus is approximately $233 million compared to $272 million at December 31, 2004. For Allstate Floridian, premiums written during 2005 totaled $426 million and property PIF, excluding the policies that have already been ceded to Universal, was approximately 560,000 as of December 31, 2005. The extent of Allstate Floridians management actions are expected to reduce premiums, PIF and the related amount of catastrophe exposure to a level more commensurate with Allstate Floridians surplus, which has declined in recent years due to losses incurred related to hurricanes, and consistent with its capacity to achieve an acceptable rating from A.M. Best. For examples of such actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 see the Hurricane section of the MD&A. Allstates domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings. As of December 31, 2005, AICs statutory surplus is approximately $14.8 billion compared to $16.9 billion at December 31, 2004. This decline is primarily due to the estimated catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the payment of $3.86 billion of dividends by AIC in 2005. During 2005, The Allstate Corporation committed to contribute capital to AIC. For more details about this commitment, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a companys premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AICs premium to surplus ratio was 1.8x on December 31, 2005 compared to 1.5x in the prior year. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurers risk based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurers solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2005, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions. 102 The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges.

Claim payments increased as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Higher operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2004 were primarily due to increased underwriting income despite catastrophe losses in 2004 and contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans in 2004. Cash provided by investing activities increased in 2005 primarily as a result of increased proceeds from sales of securities, partially offset by lower operating cash flows and higher dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily as a result of less underwriting income being available for investment due to higher operating cash flows offset by dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash provided by financing activities was the result of borrowing under our commercial paper program. Cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation, totaling $3.86 billion, $2.49 billion and $1.27 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on this limitation, without the prior approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance, AIC will not pay dividends to the Allstate Corporation until the third quarter of 2006. We expect that AIC will have sufficient liquidity to pay estimated catastrophe claims and claims expenses from existing sources of funds including operating cash flows, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and maturities and sales of investments. We expect the loss reserves from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma to be paid during 2006. Allstate Financial Higher operating cash flows for Allstate Financial in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily related to higher investment income, partially offset by lower life and annuity premiums. Lower cash flows from operating activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid, partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2005 due to lower cash provided by financing in 2005, compared to 2004, increased proceeds from sales of securities and higher investment collections, partially offset by the investment of higher operating cash flows. Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as the investment of higher financing cash flows was partially offset by lower operating cash flow. 104 Lower cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005, compared to 2004, were primarily due to higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities, lower deposits on fixed annuities and institutional products, and increased maturities of institutional products. Increased cash flows from financing activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily attributable to higher deposits of fixed annuities and institutional products, partially offset by fixed annuity withdrawals and institutional product maturities. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financials liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2005. Approximately 15.8% of these liabilities are subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment. (in millions) 2005 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 16,546 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges(1) 24,301 Market value(2) 9,729 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 9,464 Total Contractholder funds $ 60,040 (1)Includes $8.20 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance. (2)Approximately $8.61 billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30 45 day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment, including approximately $1.60 billion of market value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during 2006. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. Depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions, the Allstate Financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods. Corporate and Other Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows, were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements. Investing activities primarily relate to activity in the portfolio of Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt, repayment of debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities. We have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines of credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2005, these sources could provide over $3.48 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can also issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent 15.0% of the consolidated investment portfolio, and $8.75 billion of mortgage loans that represent 7.4% of the consolidated investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios. The sources of liquidity for 105 The Allstate Corporation include but are not limited to dividends from AIC and $2.34 billion of investments at Kennett Capital. We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows: A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining borrowing capacity was $587 million; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily. A five year revolving credit facility expiring in 2009 totaling $1.00 billion to cover short term liquidity requirements. This facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500 million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long term debt. There were no borrowings under this line of credit during 2005. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. The capacity to issue up to an additional $1.35 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. Our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease VIE obligations. The covenant requires that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements. This ratio at December 31, 2005 was 21.5%. For quantification of the synthetic lease VIE obligations, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. We closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation, the business segments and investments. Allstate Financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its ALM organization, using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio, and components of the portfolio as appropriate, which is routinely subjected to stress testing. Allstate Protections underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity, which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses. Property Liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities, including short term investments, exchange traded common stock, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows. Discontinued Lines and Coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk. Allstate Financial and Property Liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program. Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long term debt rating of A1, A+ and a (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to non investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB /bb, a downgrade in AICs financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A , or a downgrade in ALICs financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA /A . The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 106  Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements(1) $ 4,102 $ 4,102 $ $ $ Commercial paper 413 413 Contractholder funds(2) 72,881 8,669 21,715 12,699 29,798 Reserve for life contingent contract benefits(3) 28,739 1,210 3,326 2,229 21,974 Long term debt(4) 8,790 927 534 1,180 6,149 Capital lease obligations(4) 97 12 24 24 37 Operating leases(4) 822 213 301 168 140 Unconditional purchase obligations(4) 533 225 179 98 31 Pension obligations(4)(5) 153 129 24 Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense(6) 22,117 10,368 6,288 2,317 3,144 Other liabilities and accrued expenses(7)(8) 9,941 4,113 223 159 5,446 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 148,588 $ 30,381 $ 32,614 $ 18,874 $ 66,719 (1)Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash or marketable securities. We manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. (2)Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies, bank deposits and institutional products. These amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts and bank deposits, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $72.88 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $60.04 billion included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for contractholder funds. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (3)The reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Immediate annuities with life contingencies include (i) contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or illness, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as a surrender of a policy or contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $28.74 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $12.48 billion included 107 in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for reserve for life contingent contract benefits. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (4)Our payment obligations relating to long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program. Amount differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 because the long term debt amount above includes interest. (5)Pension obligations represent planned contributions to our pension plans. (6)Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported. The reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2005, of $2.20 billion and $252 million, respectively. (7)Other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $9.94 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $4.91 billion. (8)Balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $10.96 billion and deferred income taxes of $351 million. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting. In addition, other liabilities of $172 million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain. Our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Conditional(1) $ 618 $ 552 $ 66 $ $ Other Commitments Unconditional(1) 1,176 41 653 455 27 Total Commitments $ 1,794 $ 593 $ 719 $ 455 $ 27 (1)Represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans. We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required. For a more detailed discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken. In addition, we have a senior management advisory committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC"). Although the work of the ERC is still evolving, it is responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within Allstate. In the vision of the ERC, enterprise risk management ("ERM") is a disciplined, holistic, and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which: Provides additional factors when setting strategy across Allstate 108 Identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on Allstate Manages risk consistent with Allstates risk appetite Provides greater assurance of achieving Allstates objectives Allows Allstate to achieve a return commensurate with the risks taken Effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate policies, tolerances and limits; consistent ERM practices which include risk identification, evaluation, prioritization, treatment and monitoring; and effective communication and reporting. Managers in the various business units are responsible for managing, measuring, and evaluating risks as appropriate in their respective areas and that are within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise. This would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe; managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk, duration and convexity metrics; and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement. As appropriate, consistent enterprise wide measurement standards are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning and capital management. For Allstate Protection, we are utilizing an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed, given a defined tolerance for risk. Economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk/reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our business. Future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the Allstate Financial business unit and at a consolidated level so that there is a total enterprise capability. REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December 31, 2005, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS This document contains "forward looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 109 These forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC. In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services. Risks Relating to the Property Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms and terrorism. We may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our homeowners insurance business in amounts in excess of those experienced this year, in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, and in excess of those that modelers estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion, and the Northridge earthquake of 1994 totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the CEA, and various state created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted Although, along with others in the industry, we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our personal lines homeowners exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios, such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management 110 activities, there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period. Examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability, and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable. In addition, the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state specific policy language, demand surge and loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses, which are subject to wide variation by storm. Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth We believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers, will be successful over the long term, however it is possible that they will have a negative impact on near term growth and earnings. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention will be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to reduced cross selling opportunities, new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected. Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by hurricanes. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of Texas during 2002. Although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. Our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. Other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and IBNR, after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends 111 involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, and contractual terms. External factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Management believes the estimated claim reserves related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma are appropriately established and recorded based on available facts, information, laws and regulations. However, actual results may differ materially from the amounts recorded for a variety of reasons: our policyholders ability to report and our ability to adjust claims were impeded by the extent of the devastation, the size of the area affected, and the fact that some communities were hit by more than one storm; it is particularly difficult to assess the extent of damage in the initial stages of adjusting residential property losses; our estimate for the ultimate costs of repairs may not prove to be correct because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by a hurricane; the number of IBNR claims may be greater or less than anticipated; the need to have more claims adjusters to handle the large number of claims has increased pressure on our catastrophe claims settlement management process; and litigation has been filed, which if ultimately decided against us, could lead to a material increase in our catastrophe claims and claims expense estimate. Losses from catastrophes on policies Allstate sells and administers as a participant in the NFIP program are reported in our reserves for claims and claims expense and in our reinsurance recoverable. Since the level of NFIP claim activity that we experienced in 2005 is unprecedented, in subsequent fiscal quarters we may need to increase the amount of IBNR and related reinsurance recoverable. However, because the federal government is responsible for paying all such claims, we do not expect that any such increases will affect net income or shareholders equity. Additionally, the expense allowances we receive from NFIP may ultimately be determined to be either insufficient to meet our incremental expense or may prove to be in excess of such expense. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position. Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, when 112 Allstate Protections loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases, impose rate rollbacks or require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurers ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurers ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. We are subject to assessments from state insurance facilities We are currently monitoring developments with respect to various state facilities such as guaranty funds, LA Citizens, FL Citizens, the Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association, the Mississippi Residential Underwriting Association, the Alabama Insurance Underwriting Association, the Texas FAIR Plan Association and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. The ultimate impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma on these facilities is currently uncertain, but could result in the facilities recognizing a financial deficit or a financial deficit greater than the level currently estimated. They may, in turn, have the ability to assess participating insurers when financial deficits occur, adversely affecting our results of operations. These facilities are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders. Allstate and other insurance companies writing residential property policies in Florida, including FL Citizens, must participate in the FHCF, which potentially reimburses companies for their qualifying losses at various participating percentages above required retention levels subject to maximum reimbursement amounts. Allstate and these other companies currently have reimbursement recoverable balances from the FHCF for the 2004 and 2005 hurricane losses in Florida. If the FHCF does not have sufficient funds to pay its ultimate reimbursement obligations, it has the authority to issue bonds. Such bonds are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers compensation, medical malpractice and accident and health insurance. By law, these assessments are the obligation of insurance policyholders which insurance companies must collect. Companies are required to collect the FHCF assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to the FHCF as they are collected. The exposure to assessments and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases from these facilities may not offset each other in the Companys financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years. 113 The potential benefits of implementing Tiered Pricing may not be fully realized We believe that Tiered Pricing and underwriting (including SRM which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, we may lose our competitive advantage. Further, the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our Tiered Pricing model. Furthermore, because we have been using Tiered Pricing only for the last several years, we can not be assured that Tiered Pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using Tiered Pricing will increase may not be realized. Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability Our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts, satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability. Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 114 Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread based products, such as fixed annuities and institutional products, is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid or been sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Non parallel shifts in interest rates, such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates, can influence customer demand for fixed annuities, which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segments fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. For certain products, principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products, the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields. We may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates, which could narrow spreads. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability. Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the domestic and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of Allstate Financials variable annuities. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB, GMAB and GMWB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or Allstate Financials net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to AGP and EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 115 A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. Actions taken to simplify our business model and improve profitability may not be successful and may result in losses and costs Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. Actions that we have taken and may continue to take include changing the number and selection of products being marketed, terminating underperforming distribution relationships, merging or disposing of unnecessary and or non strategic legal entities, reducing policy administration software systems, and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. The actions that we have taken and may take in the future may not achieve their intended outcome and could result in lower premiums and contract charges, restructuring costs, losses on disposition or losses related to the discontinuance of individual products or distribution relationships. Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include a savings or investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. 116 We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality We are subject to market risk, the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and, to a lesser degree, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For additional information on market risk, see the "Market Risk" section of MD&A. A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolios average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also cause the purchase of longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified. We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large company, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation, including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In some circumstances, we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we pay in judgments, settlements and litigation expenses. However, we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability, if any, or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation. Consequently, the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and, therefore, may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters. 117 We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth As insurance companies, broker dealers, investment advisers and or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation. Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 118 The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Additionally, in the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial could be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurers statutory capital; a change in a rating agencys determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurers investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurers control. The insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are A+, AA and Aa2 from A.M. Best, Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively. Several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies. Because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. As a result of the capital support agreement with AIC, in certain circumstances it could be compelled in 2006 to make a capital contribution that would be completed out of The Allstate Corporations available sources of liquidity. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the 119 payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our debt and complete repurchase programs in the timeframe expected. The occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems. In the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.  Item 7A.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. 8  Reconciliation of Claims Reserves The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Year Ended December 31, GROSS ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 19,338 $ 17,714 $ 16,690 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 25,319 18,994 17,183 Change in provision attributable to prior years (127 ) 448 704 Total claims and claims expense 25,192 19,442 17,887 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 14,966 11,494 10,240 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 7,447 6,324 6,623 Total payments 22,413 17,818 16,863 Gross reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table $ 22,117 $ 19,338 $ 17,714 Year Ended December 31, NET ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, beginning of year $ 16,761 $ 15,980 $ 15,018 Incurred claims and claims expense Provision attributable to the current year 21,643 18,073 17,031 Change in provision attributable to prior years (468 ) (230 ) 401 Total claims and claims expense 21,175 17,843 17,432 Claim payments Claims and claims expense attributable to current year 12,340 10,989 10,195 Claims and claims expense attributable to prior years 6,665 6,073 6,275 Total payments 19,005 17,062 16,470 Net reserve for property liability claims and claims expense, end of year as shown on 10 K loss reserve development table(1) $ 18,931 $ 16,761 $ 15,980 (1)Reserves for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $3.19 billion, $2.58 billion, and $1.73 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 9 The year end 2005 gross reserves of $22.12 billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $4.32 billion more than the net reserve balance of $17.79 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $3.19 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $854 million. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting. As the tables above illustrate, Allstates net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2004 decreased in 2005 by $468 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of $127 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions. Loss Reserve Reestimates The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstates expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. 10 Loss Reserve Reestimates December 31, ($ millions) 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Gross Reserves for Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 17,326 $ 17,382 $ 17,403 $ 16,881 $ 17,814 $ 16,859 $ 16,500 $ 16,690 $ 17,714 $ 19,338 $ 22,117 Deduct: Reinsurance Recoverable 1,490 1,784 1,630 1,458 1,653 1,634 1,667 1,672 1,734 2,577 3,186 Reserve For Unpaid Claims and Claims Expense $ 15,836 $ 15,598 $ 15,773 $ 15,423 $ 16,161 $ 15,225 $ 14,833 $ 15,018 $ 15,980 $ 16,761 $ 18,931 Paid (cumulative) as of: One year later 5,787 5,013 5,488 5,615 5,973 6,748 6,874 6,275 6,073 6,665 Two years later 8,232 7,952 8,361 8,638 9,055 10,066 9,931 9,241 9,098 Three years later 10,083 9,773 10,336 10,588 11,118 11,889 11,730 11,165 Four years later 11,170 11,040 11,587 11,950 12,197 12,967 12,949 Five years later 12,034 11,847 12,512 12,608 12,842 13,768 Six years later 12,590 12,528 12,967 13,038 13,434 Seven years later 13,134 12,881 13,294 13,532 Eight years later 13,429 13,146 13,735 Nine years later 13,660 13,553 Ten years later 14,048 Reserve Reestimated as of: End of year 15,836 15,598 15,773 15,423 16,161 15,225 14,833 15,018 15,980 16,761 18,931 One year later 15,500 14,921 15,073 14,836 15,439 15,567 15,518 15,419 15,750 16,293 Two years later 14,917 14,450 14,548 14,371 15,330 15,900 16,175 15,757 15,677 Three years later 14,700 14,156 14,183 14,296 15,583 16,625 16,696 15,949 Four years later 14,613 13,894 14,168 14,530 16,317 17,249 16,937 Five years later 14,455 13,888 14,406 15,260 17,033 17,501 Six years later 14,452 14,140 15,109 16,024 17,302 Seven years later 14,703 14,824 15,899 16,292 Eight years later 15,370 15,625 16,184 Nine years later 16,160 15,911 Ten years later 16,451 Initial reserve in excess of (less than) reestimated reserve: Amount of reestimate $ (615 ) $ (313 ) $ (411 ) $ (869 ) $ (1,141 ) $ (2,276 ) $ (2,104 ) $ (931 ) $ 303 $ 468 Percent 3.9 % 2.0 % 2.6 % 5.6 % 7.1 % 14.9 % 14.2 % 6.2 % 1.9 % 2.8 % Gross Reestimated Liability Latest $ 19,253 $ 19,020 $ 19,104 $ 19,105 $ 20,229 $ 20,423 $ 19,836 $ 18,832 $ 18,383 $ 19,211 Reestimated Recoverable Latest 2,802 3,109 2,920 2,813 2,927 2,922 2,899 2,883 2,706 2,918 Net Reestimated Liability Latest $ 16,451 $ 15,911 $ 16,184 $ 16,292 $ 17,302 $ 17,501 $ 16,937 $ 15,949 $ 15,677 $ 16,293 Gross Cumulative Reestimate (Increase) Decrease $ (1,927 ) $ (1,638 ) $ (1,701 ) $ (2,224 ) $ (2,415 ) $ (3,564 ) $ (3,336 ) $ (2,142 ) $ (669 ) $ 127 Amount of Reestimates for Each Segment December 31, ($ millions) 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Net Discontinued Lines and Coverages Reestimate $ (2,054 ) $ (1,719 ) $ (1,751 ) $ (1,679 ) $ (1,642 ) $ (1,633 ) $ (1,607 ) $ (1,376 ) $ (802 ) $ (167 ) Net Allstate Protection Reestimate 1,439 1,406 1,340 810 501 (643 ) (497 ) 445 1,105 635 Amount of Reestimate (Net) $ (615 ) $ (313 ) $ (411 ) $ (869 ) $ (1,141 ) $ (2,276 ) $ (2,104 ) $ (931 ) $ 303 $ 468 11 As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established from December 31, 1995 to December 31, 2002 reflects additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The decreases in net reserves established as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below. The following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended December 31, 2005. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable.

The favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. Favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs. The impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude. Beginning in the early 1990s, lower medical cost inflation rates, as evidenced by the consumer price index ("CPI") published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for medical costs, have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates. From 1991 through 1995, the medical CPI averaged 6.3%, and from 1996 through 2000, the average declined to 3.4%. The medical CPI is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies, including doctors fees, emergency care, therapy and rehabilitation, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are covered claims for insureds. In 2005, the medical CPI was 4.2%, and most recent economic forecasts anticipate future increases in medical inflation. If this occurs, future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates. Our loss management programs over time have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends. We have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims, consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims, more accurate valuation of damages, and more effective negotiation and defense practices. These 12 improvements have also involved hiring additional staff, providing increased training, creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims, and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims, claims with attorney involvement, and claims in litigation. These programs were intended to create an improved culture, focused on expert, efficient, and effective claim process management. Since 1993, growth of Allstates injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results. We believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements, and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates. While changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims, these changes can impact historical patterns of losses, introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims. In 2005 and 2004, we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years. Favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In 2003 and 2002, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2003, were due to favorable Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates, offset by unfavorable increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2002 were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. In 2001, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported in the year 2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the Encompass and Canadian businesses. For additional information regarding reserves, see "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves." REGULATION Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries, not the holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, accounting methods, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Notes 13 and 15 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference. In recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope 13 of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. Agent and Broker Compensation. In 2005, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. As of the end of the year, new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states, including Texas. Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive. Holding Company Regulation. The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporations common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporations common stock. Price Regulation. Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the states regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file and use, or (iii) use and file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it. In states having file and use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulators approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A 14 use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Approximately one half of the states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing. An insurers ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurers ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurers ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. Changes in Allstates claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments. From time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing. Involuntary Markets. As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations. Guaranty Funds. Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. National Flood Insurance Program. We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own ("WYO") carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). The NFIP is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"). We operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy ("SFIP"). This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States Treasury. We receive expense allowances from NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commission and adjuster fees. Investment Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of 15 non conforming investments. As of December 31, 2005 the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects. Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non Renewing Policies. Most states regulate an insurers ability to exit a market. For example, states limit, to varying degrees, an insurers ability to cancel and non renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurers ability to exit unprofitable markets. Variable Life Insurance, Variable Annuities and Registered Fixed Annuities. The sale of variable life insurance, variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers. Broker Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies. The Allstate entities that operate as broker dealers, registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company group. In addition, it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, including our parent company, to engage in activities that are not financial in nature. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Banking. The Allstate Corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift Supervision. The bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking. Privacy Regulation. Federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information. Asbestos. President Bush has indicated support for efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation. Congress has considered such legislation in the past, but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. In February 2006, there was a renewed effort to bring such measures before the Senate. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos. Environmental. Environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini Superfund") govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties" (PRPs). Superfund and the mini Superfunds (Environmental Clean up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent 16 on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response, investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstates exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted. INTERNET WEBSITE Our Internet website address is allstate.com.

In the twelve month period ending December 31, 2005, Allstate Insurance Company paid dividends of $3.86 billion. Based on the greater of 2005 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that Allstate Insurance Company will be able to pay without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2006 is $1.75 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus. 20 Period Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased(1) Average Price Paid per Share (or Unit) Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(2) Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares (or Units) that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs October 1, 2005 October 31, 2005 1,890,000 $ 53.6066 1,890,000 $1.7 billion November 1, 2005 November 30, 2005 1,090,953 $ 56.1161 1,090,000 $1.6 billion December 1, 2005 December 31, 2005 1,345,000 $ 54.9727 1,345,000 $1.5 billion Total 4,325,953 $ 54.6642 4,325,000 (1)Shares repurchased other than through a publicly announced program.

Previously, the trust preferred securities were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts and the dividends reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. The impact of deconsolidation was to increase long term debt and decrease mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts by $200 million. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect this change. (2)We use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property Liability results. We believe that they enhance an investors understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses; Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned; Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting (loss) income as a percentage of premiums earned. 22   Item 7.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5 year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Segment sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include: For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and severity (average cost per claim) trends, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses and underwriting results; For Allstate Financial: premiums, deposits, gross margin including investment and benefit margins, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, expenses, operating income, and invested assets; For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration; For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt leverage, and return on equity; and For product distribution: profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate exclusive agencies sales of all products and services. 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Net income was $1.77 billion in 2005 compared to a net income of $3.18 billion in 2004. Net income per diluted share was $2.64 in 2005 compared to net income per diluted share of $4.54 in 2004. These declines were primarily due to catastrophes. Total revenues reached a record $35.38 billion, an increase of 4.3% compared to last year. Property Liability premiums earned increased 4.0% to $27.04 billion. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, primarily due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, with an impact to the combined ratio of 21.0 points, compared to $2.47 billion in 2004, with a combined ratio impact of 9.5 points. Allstate Financial investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Total of $2.45 billion shares of stock were repurchased during the year. Book value per share was $31.01 as of December 31, 2005 compared to $31.72 as of December 31, 2004. Return on equity declined 6.6 points to 8.4%. 24 CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Property liability insurance premiums $ 27,039 $ 25,989 $ 24,677 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges 2,049 2,072 2,304 Net investment income 5,746 5,284 4,972 Realized capital gains and losses 549 591 196 Total revenues 35,383 33,936 32,149 Costs and expenses Property liability insurance claims and claims expense (21,175 ) (17,843 ) (17,432 ) Life and annuity contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2,403 ) (2,001 ) (1,846 ) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (4,721 ) (4,465 ) (4,058 ) Operating costs and expenses (2,997 ) (3,040 ) (3,001 ) Restructuring and related charges (41 ) (51 ) (74 ) Interest expense (330 ) (308 ) (275 ) Total costs and expenses (33,282 ) (29,326 ) (28,537 ) Loss on disposition of operations (13 ) (24 ) (41 ) Income tax expense (323 ) (1,230 ) (846 ) Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust(s) (5 ) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax 1,765 3,356 2,720 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (15 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 Property Liability $ 1,431 $ 3,045 $ 2,521 Allstate Financial 416 246 305 Corporate and Other (82 ) (110 ) (121 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have identified five accounting policies that require us to make assumptions and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates related to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on 25 either widely accepted pricing valuation models, which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs, or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities, are difficult to independently observe and quantify. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities. For investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities, net of deferred income taxes, is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a securitys fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors. For our portfolio review evaluations, we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration, revision to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions; and any dispositions planned by the portfolio managers. In these instances, we recognize impairment on securities being considered for these approved planned actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near term and long term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuers ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducement costs and related deferred tax, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness We primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, particularly in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is 26 based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transactions variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. DAC related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. DAC related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximate the estimated lives of the policies. DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits which includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization periods range from 15 30 years; however, estimates of customer surrender rates, partial withdrawals and deaths generally result in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. AGP and EGP consist of the following components: benefit margins primarily from mortality, including guaranteed minimum death, income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses. DAC amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is estimated using stochastic modeling and is significantly impacted by the anticipated return on the underlying funds. Our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance, net of fees, was approximately 7% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 and 2003. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from the expectation, we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return 27 over a seven year period equals the long term expectation. This process is referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the future mean rates of return including fees projected over the five year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. We periodically evaluate the results of utilizing this process to confirm that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long term mean within this time horizon. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking". For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A and Note 2 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements. Reserve for Property Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date. Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the current accident year as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years. We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. Accordingly, we believe that it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined. 28 The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, excluding the unprecedented hurricane losses experienced in 2005 which we expect will be paid during 2006, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Catastrophe Losses, Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Life Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. For further discussion of these policies, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A. 29 PROPERTY LIABILITY 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 35, reached a record $27.39 billion during 2005. Compared to 2004, premiums written increased 3.2% due to increases in the number of policies in force ("PIF") for Allstate brand standard auto of 2.9% and homeowners of 3.4% and higher average premiums. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners premiums written increased 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in 2005 over 2004. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums decreased 0.3% and 7.0%, respectively, compared to 2004. Underwriting loss for Property Liability was $636 million in 2005 compared to underwriting income of $1.83 billion in 2004 due to higher catastrophes, increased severity of current year claims and a $120 million accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit and lower favorable Allstate Protection reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable claim frequencies excluding catastrophes and lower unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years in Discontinued Lines and Coverages in 2005. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP, is defined below. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion compared to $2.47 billion in 2004. The effect of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio was 21.0 and 9.5 points in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Catastrophe losses include $5.00 billion related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million for assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida ("FL Citizens"). PROPERTY LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two brands, the Allstate brand and Encompass brand. Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 32, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting (loss) income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investors understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses. 30 Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting (loss) income as a percentage of premiums earned. We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods. Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned. Effect of pretax reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of pretax reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio on page 43 is equal to the Property Liability combined ratio. 31  Summarized financial data, a reconciliation of underwriting (loss) income to net income and GAAP operating ratios for our Property Liability operations for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

The Encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products while the Deerbrook brand is used for non standard auto products. The key elements of the Allstate Protection strategy are: Investing in marketing and brand awareness Improving customer experience Expanding distribution Utilizing sophisticated pricing and underwriting discipline Developing innovative and differentiated products Leveraging claims capabilities We are seeking, through the utilization of our distribution channels, our sophisticated risk segmentation process ("Tiered Pricing") and consumer marketing, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We maintain a broad marketing approach throughout the U.S. We have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on Allstate brand profitability, unit growth, retention, and sales of Allstate Financial products. We differentiate the Allstate brand from competitors through new innovative products such as Allstate&reg; Your Choice Auto. We continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brands exclusive agencies and The Good Hands&reg; Network. Tiered Pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential, and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard/non standard model. Tiered Pricing includes our Strategic Risk Management ("SRM") program, which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including, to the extent legally permissible, insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports. We continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases. As we continue to use Tiered Pricing, there is a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations, including the distinctions between standard and non standard which have become less relevant in certain states. For this reason, we believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non standard business. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers. Substantially all of new and approximately 61% of renewal business written for Allstate brand auto uses Tiered Pricing, an increase from 58% in 2004 when computed on a comparable basis. For Allstate brand homeowners, approximately 82% of new and 43% of renewal business written uses Tiered Pricing. For Allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under Tiered Pricing, our results indicate an 33 increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results. Our strategy for the Encompass brand focuses on those markets that give us the best opportunity to grow profitably, in part by using Tiered Pricing. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for PIF. As a result, percent changes in PIF, average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion. We are continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators, such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels including cost of reinsurance coverage purchased and catastrophe losses, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes. An important element of our strategy is to manage our property catastrophe exposure to enable our shareholders to earn an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers. Although in many areas of the country we are currently achieving returns within acceptable risk tolerances, we continue to seek solutions to improve returns in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes. We will significantly reduce our catastrophe exposure over time while working to mitigate the impact of our actions on customers. We are also working for changes in the regulatory environment, including fewer restrictions on underwriting, recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property lines. Pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe) are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing. Accordingly, property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products. Actions we are taking and evaluating to attain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our personal and commercial property businesses include: additional purchases of reinsurance; increased participation in various state facilities such as wind pools; changes in rates, deductibles and coverage; limitations on new business writings; changes to underwriting requirements; non renewal; discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences; withdrawal from certain markets; and or pursuing alternative markets for placement of business or segments of risk exposure in certain areas. While actions taken will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our personal and commercial property businesses, we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines when evaluating the feasibility of their implementation. In order to assess and monitor our actions, we are considering and adopting new performance measurements for managing our property business. These measurements currently include exposure limits based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, acceptable targeted rates of return by line and by state and potential exposure to capital impairment. As part of our catastrophe management efforts, we are involved with a newly created coalition called ProtectingAmerica.org. The coalition is dedicated to raising awareness, educating the public and 34 policymakers, and offering solutions that will better prepare and protect consumers, taxpayers and the American economy from major catastrophes in a sensible, cost effective fashion. A comprehensive solution is being advanced that includes the development of government sponsored, privately funded catastrophe funds at the state and national levels; improved prevention and mitigation measures, including the adoption of more effective land use policies and stronger building codes; enhanced public education about catastrophe risk; better catastrophe relief, recovery and rebuilding processes; and a rigorous process of continuous improvement for catastrophe preparedness and response programs and processes. Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken during 2005 and 2004 will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned. % earned after (in millions) 2005 2004 90 days 180 days 270 days 360 days Allstate brand: Standard auto $ 3,851 $ 3,703 74.3 % 98.8 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Non standard auto 401 455 73.3 % 98.1 % 99.6 % 100.0 % Auto 4,252 4,158 74.2 % 98.7 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners 3,252 3,029 43.3 % 75.5 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 1,302 1,309 44.5 % 75.9 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Total Allstate brand 8,806 8,496 59.5 % 87.6 % 97.1 % 100.0 % Encompass brand: Standard auto 594 606 44.0 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 28 36 75.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Auto 622 642 45.4 % 76.8 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Homeowners 317 289 43.7 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 84 78 44.1 % 75.9 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Total Encompass brand 1,023 1,009 44.8 % 76.4 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Total Allstate Protection unearned premiums $ 9,829 $ 9,505 57.9 % 86.4 % 96.8 % 100.0 % 35 A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.

(2)Encompass brand statistics are subject to some distortion due to the integration of systems. Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written decreased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to a decrease in new business applications of 6.9% primarily related to competitive pressures in certain states and the effects of our catastrophe risk management actions. Renewal business premiums increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in renewal average premiums. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher average new and renewal premiums primarily due to a shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos and, to a lesser extent, rate actions. The level of rate changes declined in 2005 due to frequency declines and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. Additionally, the state of New York implemented a rate reduction in July 2005 that reduced the countrywide rate impact by 0.4%. Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty. New business comparisons in 2004 also reflected the July 2003 implementation of our new rating plan in the California market. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. The rate of increase in average premium declined in 2004 due to the decrease in rate activity. The reduced level of rate changes are due to declines in frequency and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. For Allstate brand standard auto, 37 the countrywide rate change was 1.3% and the state specific rate change was 3.3% during 2004. For Encompass brand standard auto, the countrywide rate change was 2.8% and the state specific rate change was 4.4% during 2004. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in average premium. Renewal business written premium declined in 2005 as the decline in PIF more than offset increases in average premium. The increases in average premium are primarily due to rate activity, the effect of which is declining due to a decrease in rate change activity. PIF declined in 2005 due to insufficient new business to offset declines due to decreases in the renewal ratio. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 and renewal business premiums written decreased in 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in new PIF and rate activity. We expect the rate of decline in Encompass brand standard auto PIF to continue to moderate as we pursue growth opportunities in this channel. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for standard auto during 2005. These rate changes do not reflect initial rates filed for new insurance subsidiaries. # of States Countrywide(%)(1) State Specific(%)(2) Allstate brand(3) 23 0.4 1.0 Encompass brand 22 0.7 1.6 (1)Represents the impact in the states where rate changes were approved during 2005 as a percentage of total countrywide prior year end premiums written.

Allstate brand non standard auto new business premiums declined during 2005 due to lower new business production as agencies continued to focus on our standard auto business. Declines in Allstate brand renewal business premiums during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower renewal PIF and average premium. Renewal PIF decreased because new business production in prior periods was insufficient to make up for an inherently low renewal ratio in this business. The decline in average premium during 2005 when compared to 2004 is due to mix of business and a decrease in rates. In 2004, the increase in average premium declined due to the decrease in rate activity. 38 Encompass brand (Deerbrook) non standard premiums written decreased in 2005 and 2004 primarily because of declines in new business. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for non standard auto during 2005.

Allstate brand auto new business premiums written decreased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to a decrease in new business applications of 7.9% primarily related to competitive pressures in certain states and the effects of our catastrophe risk management actions. Renewal business premiums increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in renewal average premiums. The increase in Allstate brand auto PIF as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. The increase in the Allstate brand auto average premium in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher average new and renewal premiums primarily due to a shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos and, to a lesser extent, rate actions. The level of rate changes declined in 2005 due to frequency declines and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. Additionally, the state of New York implemented a rate reduction in July 2005 that reduced the countrywide rate impact by 0.4%. The increase in Allstate brand auto PIF in 2004 when compared to 2003 is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty. New business comparisons in 2004 also reflected the July 2003 implementation of our new rating plan in the California market. The increase in the Allstate brand auto average premium in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. The rate of increase in average premium declined in 2004 due to the decrease in rate activity. The reduced level of rate changes are due to declines in frequency and severity increases below our pricing 39 assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. For Allstate brand auto, the countrywide rate change was 1.3% and the state specific rate change was 3.4% during 2004. For Encompass brand auto, the countrywide rate change was 2.7% and the state specific rate change was 4.3% during 2004. Encompass brand auto new business premiums written increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in average premium. Renewal business written premium declined in 2005 as the decline in PIF more than offset increases in average premium. The increases in average premium are primarily due to rate activity, the effect of which is declining due to a decrease in rate change activity. PIF declined in 2005 due to insufficient new business to offset declines due to decreases in the renewal ratio. Encompass brand auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 and renewal business premiums written decreased in 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in new PIF and rate activity.

In 2005, growth in Allstate Protection homeowners premiums written from the prior year periods was impacted by our catastrophe risk management actions. Excluding the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and business ceded to Universal Insurance Company of North America ("Universal"), premiums written grew 9.6% in 2005 compared to 2004.

Allstate brand homeowners new business premiums written declined in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to our catastrophe risk management actions. The increase in Allstate brand homeowners 40 PIF as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. PIF is also being impacted by the non renewal of approximately 95,000 of Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ("Allstate Floridian") policies to Universal or approximately 1% of Allstate brand homeowners PIF. These policies non renewed at a rate of 13% in third quarter of 2005 and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2005, and are expected to non renew at a rate of 23% in the first quarter of 2006, 28% in the second quarter of 2006 and 12% in the third quarter of 2006. The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 was the result of the increases in new business due to a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and increased customer loyalty. The increases in Allstate brand homeowners average premium during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums, primarily related to increases in insured value along with rate actions taken in the current and prior years. Encompass brand homeowners new business premiums written increased in 2005 and 2004 due to increases in PIF and average premium. Increases in Encompass brand homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year and increases in insured value. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for homeowners during 2005.

The decline was the result of increased catastrophe losses, lower favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and increased current year claim severity, partly offset by increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and lower operating costs. In 2005, claims and claims expense and the claims and claims expense ratio include the effect of $120 million or 0.4 points related to an accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit challenging our overtime exemption under California wage and hour laws ("accrual for litigation"). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A. Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $2.47 billion during 2004 compared to $1.90 billion in 2003. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity. Claims and claims expense during 2005 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $5.00 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. These estimates include net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. For a further discussion of catastrophe losses, see page 45. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2005 and 2004 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Maintenance and Repair price index and the Parts & Equipment price index. In 2005 and 2004, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends. Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. In 2005 and 2004, we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. 42 Loss ratios are a measure of profitability. Loss ratios by product, and expense and combined ratios by brand, are shown in the following table. These ratios are defined on page 30.

The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity more than offsetting higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included the impact of an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. The Encompass brand standard auto loss ratio in 2005 was also unfavorably impacted as a result of higher current year claim severity partially offset by lower claim frequency. Standard auto loss ratio declined 5.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 3.9 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to decreases in premiums earned, higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity partly offset by lower claim frequency. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Encompass brand decreased 8.6 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio declined 11.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.9 points for Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve 43 reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Auto loss ratio increased 1.7 points for the Allstate brand and 3.9 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes being more than offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. Auto loss ratio declined 6.3 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, lower claim frequency and higher premiums earned for Allstate brand, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Homeowners loss ratio increased 43.3 points for the Allstate brand and 14.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses, unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher current year claim severity partially offset by higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Homeowners loss ratio increased 4.2 points for the Allstate brand and declined 13.0 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, excluding catastrophes for the Allstate brand, and higher current year claim severity. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection decreased 0.3 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 primarily due to a reduction in employee incentives due to lower financial results for 2005. In 2004, the ratio increased due to higher amortization of DAC resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table. Allstate brand Encompass brand 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Amortization of DAC 14.7 14.5 13.9 20.5 19.6 19.1 Other costs and expenses 8.7 9.2 9.3 9.1 9.0 9.9 Restructuring and related charges 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.3 Total expense ratio 23.5 23.9 23.5 29.9 29.0 29.3 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximates the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 24.0 in 2005, 24.3 in 2004 and 23.9 in 2003. The expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to CNA Financial Corporation, which ended in the fourth quarter of 2005. The licensing fees were 1.5% of premiums written by independent agencies appointed by CNA for a period of six years after acquisition of the CNA personal lines business ("Encompass") in 1999. Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $40 million and $6 million, respectively. 44 DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting and direct mail solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the time frames in which premiums are earned. The balance of DAC for each product type at December 31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted. Historical Catastrophe Experience Since the beginning of 1992, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property Liability loss ratio was 7.6 points. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), FHCF or placed with a third party, such as hurricane coverage in Hawaii. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California earthquakes, on our Property Liability loss ratio was 6.1 points since the beginning of 1992. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years 1992 through 2005 is shown in the following table. Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, and losses from California earthquakes Eastern and gulf coast states 38.0 31.4 All other 22.0 14.3 Total 30.7 23.7 Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Limitations include our participation in various state facilities, such as the CEA, which provides insurance for California earthquake losses; the FHCF, which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses; and other state 45 facilities, such as wind pools. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our participation, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities. Hurricanes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Policies in force attributable to counties along the eastern and gulf coasts, including the entire state of Florida, represented approximately 25% of total homeowners policies in force during 2005. Generally, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas. Examples of actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 to reduce our exposure in these areas include purchasing reinsurance as discussed below; a moratorium on personal homeowners new business writings and the non renewal of select policies in eight coastal counties in the state of New York; a definitive agreement with Universal whereby a portion of existing customers in Florida will have new policies available when their policies expire and are not renewed; and exiting the commercial property market in Florida beginning in May 2005. We have also received approval for homeowners premium rate increases in the state of Florida averaging 7.9% implemented in August 2005, followed by an additional rate increase averaging 18.2%, implemented in October 2005. The October rate increase is subject to review by the state regulator to the extent that the actual expense ratios, including the cost of additional reinsurance to be acquired, are less than estimated expense ratios in the rate increase filings. Further, the rate increase is subject to refund or credits to the extent the approved rate is determined to have resulted in an excessive rate for the 12 month period starting October 1, 2005. While hurricanes can also be devastating to inland areas, we anticipate that our actions will be less extensive in these areas and they will be determined based on an assessment of our local exposure. Earthquakes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. Premiums written attributable to earthquake coverage totaled approximately $60 million in 2005. Earthquake coverage is generally written as an option or as a standard covered peril depending on policy language requirements in each state. Our current strategy is to significantly reduce earthquake exposure by limiting earthquake coverage in policies, pursuing alternative markets for placement of this coverage and purchasing reinsurance. The implementation of the alternative markets strategy is subject to the identification and negotiation of arrangements with other companies to allow our agencies to place the coverage. Our initial focus will be in states with the highest earthquake exposure. Examples of actions we have already taken in these areas include our discontinuation of writing earthquake coverage in California following the formation of the CEA in 1996, allowing our agencies to place new business earthquake coverage with another carrier in the state of South Carolina beginning in 2005 and no longer offering new optional coverage and removing optional coverage from policies in most states beginning in 2006. We also continue to evaluate purchases of reinsurance including coverage for potential assessments from the CEA. We anticipate that implementation of limitations on new and renewal optional earthquake coverage will not adversely impact either auto or homeowners production and that it will cause a relatively immaterial decline in premiums written, but will result in a material reduction of exposure from catastrophic earthquake losses. We also expect that this reduction in exposure will allow for some reduction in our capital requirements. 46  We include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2005, catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and other anticipated recoveries totaled $5.67 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $2.47 billion in 2004 and $1.49 billion in 2003. Of the $5.67 billion of catastrophe losses incurred during 2005, $5.00 billion related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million related to assessments from FL Citizens. Through February 8, 2006, approximately 78% of the property claim counts and 97% of the auto claim counts related to each of these events are closed, and we expect substantially all of our remaining estimated net losses related to the 2005 hurricane season will be paid during 2006. We had $2.89 billion of gross catastrophe related reserves held at December 31, 2005.

Catastrophe claims and claims expense estimates include losses from approximately 103,000 expected claims of which over 93,000 claims have been reported.

In addition, Allstate Floridian has reinsurance on certain personal homeowners policies in Florida with Universal. For further discussion of these reinsurance and other recoveries, see the reinsurance section of the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A and Note 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2005 our longstanding contract with Pilot Catastrophe Services ("Pilot") for additional claims adjustors aided in our ability to complete more timely claims payments. Catastrophe losses also include $120 million of accruals for two assessments from FL Citizens and $34 million from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("LA Citizens"). These entities were created by their respective states to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market and can levy an assessment on participating companies for a financial deficit. After paying assessments, we expect that our subsidiaries will be able to recoup them in part through premiums written in the state. These recoupments will be recorded as an offset to catastrophe losses in the period that the related premiums are written and are expected to be primarily recorded over the next two years. For further discussion of these assessments, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Claims and claims expense during 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This estimate includes net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. Allstate Protection Outlook We expect to see continued growth of Allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased PIF resulting from increases in the number of agencies representing us, advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty, however total Allstate Protection premiums written will likely be comparable to 2005 levels due to the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on property premiums, including the impacts of increased ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance. We expect to experience a slowing rate of decline in our non standard auto product and Encompass brand standard auto while maintaining profitability in these businesses. We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results, however this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions including purchases of reinsurance. We will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for technology and reinsurance. For example, there will be an investment in claims technology of approximately $95 million over 2006, 2007 and 2008 as a result of our claims system reengineering. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including increases in benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments. 49 DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. As part of its responsibilities, this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations. Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums written $ (2 ) $ 4 $ 12 Premiums earned $ 1 $ 6 $ 13 Claims and claims expense (167 ) (635 ) (574 ) Other costs and expenses (9 ) (9 ) (10 ) Underwriting loss $ (175 ) $ (638 ) $ (571 ) During 2005, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $139 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $18 million, $22 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $463 million, and an increase of $136 million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. See the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A for a more detailed discussion. Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. We are somewhat encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity seems to be slowing, perhaps reflecting various recent state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims. In addition, we continue to monitor the possibility of federal legislation related to these claims. PROPERTY LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 1.0% in 2005 when compared to last year, after increasing 5.7% in 2004 when compared to 2003. These increases were due to higher income from partnerships and higher fixed income portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. 50 The following table presents the average pretax investment yields for the year ended December 31. 2005(1)(3) 2004(2)(3) 2003(2)(3) Fixed income securities: tax exempt 5.2 % 5.4 % 5.5 % Fixed income securities: tax exempt equivalent 7.6 7.9 7.8 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.0 5.2 5.5 Equity securities 4.8 4.6 4.4 Mortgage loans 5.5 5.5 7.7 Total portfolio 5.0 5.1 5.3 (1)Pretax yield is calculated as investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the investment balances at the beginning and end of period and any interim quarters.

Property Liability Investment Outlook As a result of our recent years catastrophe experience and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation in 2005, investment income for 2006 is expected to slightly decline relative to the prior year due to lower cash flows from operating activities causing a decline in portfolio balances. Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate due to the impact of the current interest rate environment. PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These 51 reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date. Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three year or two year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate. Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates. Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December 31, 2005, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $120 million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $120 million. For a further description of our 52 reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.

Unfavorable homeowner reserve reestimates in 2005 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected. In 2005, reestimates included $66 million related to 2004 hurricanes of which $31 million was the FL Citizens assessment that was accruable in 2005. These were offset primarily by late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2004 were primarily due to late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. Other lines reserve reestimates in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily the result of claim severity development different than anticipated in previous estimates. 54 Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected. The Allstate brand experienced $209 million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2003. This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. These trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Reserve reestimates $ 613 $ 872 $ 209 Allstate brand underwriting (loss) income (437 ) 2,340 1,941 Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income 140.3 % 37.3 % 10.8 % Encompass brand Reserve reestimates in 2005 were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs.

Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders. Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2005 and for asbestos and other discontinued lines in 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 1,464 $ 139 $ 1,079 $ 463 $ 635 $ 520 Environmental Claims 232 2 257 304 2 Other Discontinued Lines 631 26 501 172 491 52 Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 2,327 $ 167 $ 1,837 $ 635 $ 1,430 $ 574 Underwriting (loss) income (175 ) (638 ) (571 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (95.4 )% (99.5 )% (100.5 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2005, 2004 and 2003, totaling $139 million, $463 million and $520 million, respectively, were primarily for products related coverage. They were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims, excess policyholders with new claims, and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions, as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported. These trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry, which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity, and bankruptcy actions. During 2004, reserve reestimates, including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, included $150 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $22 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s, including reinsurance on 57 primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature. Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our direct excess business. Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro rata coverage. Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country. 58 The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 Incurred claims and claims expense 200 139 971 463 800 520 Claims and claims expense paid (422 ) (230 ) (127 ) (78 ) (121 ) (76 ) Ending reserves $ 2,205 $ 1,373 $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 Annual survival ratio 5.2 6.0 19.1 18.8 13.1 14.2 3 year survival ratio 9.9 10.7 16.1 13.9 11.1 10.9 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 Incurred claims and claims expense 3 2 1 2 Claims and claims expense paid (32 ) (29 ) (35 ) (25 ) (78 ) (49 ) Ending reserves $ 252 $ 205 $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 Annual survival ratio 7.9 7.2 8.1 9.1 4.0 5.2 3 year survival ratio 5.2 6.0 4.3 5.0 4.3 5.0 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 5.4 6.1 16.7 16.4 9.5 10.7 3 year survival ratio 9.0 9.7 12.5 11.2 8.8 8.9 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 68.0 % 61.6 % 59.9 % The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. In 2005, the asbestos survival ratio declined due to an increase in claims paid, primarily due to commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn caused reduced reserve levels. In 2004, the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. In 2004, the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments. 59  The total commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2005, 2004 and 2003 excluding these commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 322 $ 176 $ 32 $ 22 $ 54 $ 33 Annual survival ratio 21.1 24.9 25.2 25.5 22.7 24.2 3 year survival ratio 24.7 26.8 31.7 28.4 21.9 22.2 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 13 $ 13 $ 22 $ 14 $ 42 $ 24 Annual survival ratio 13.7 13.1 21.7 20.7 8.4 10.0 3 year survival ratio 13.1 13.2 9.7 10.0 7.7 8.4 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 335 $ 189 $ 54 $ 36 $ 96 $ 57 Annual survival ratio 20.0 22.2 24.8 24.7 17.7 19.0 3 year survival ratio 22.6 23.6 25.6 22.6 16.7 16.9 Our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy as it determines a more normalized survival ratio by measuring the impact over three years and by excluding from payments amounts no longer carried in the reserves and not viewed in this ratio as a continuing payment level. Now at 26.8 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2005, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2005 would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately $33 million. Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions) Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Direct policyholders: Primary 46 $ 18 1 % 52 $ 23 2 % 52 $ 28 3 % Excess 333 180 13 322 297 20 286 201 19 Total 379 198 14 % 374 320 22 % 338 229 22 % Assumed reinsurance 215 16 222 15 191 17 IBNR claims 960 70 922 63 659 61 Total net reserves $ 1,373 100 % $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,079 100 % Total reserve additions $ 139 $ 463 $ 514 (1) (1)Excludes a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. 60 During the last three years, 186 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 87 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 99 during the period. The 99 increase comprised 5 from 2005, 36 from 2004 and 58 from 2003. The increase of 5 from 2005 included 37 new policyholders reporting new claims and 32 policyholders claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2005, totaled $139 million and included the following factors: Direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by $5 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis. Direct excess insurance net reserves decreased by $117 million as a result of significant settlement activity including two major settlements during the fourth quarter of 2005. Assumed reinsurance net reserves decreased by $7 million due to a significant commutation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 New Claims(1) 256 361 265 (1)New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies. IBNR net reserves increased by $38 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2005 IBNR represented 70% of total asbestos reserves, 7 points higher than at December 31, 2004. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new insurance policyholders and ceding companies. Our non products case reserves represent approximately 5% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure. For environmental exposures, a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table. Number of Claims 2005 2004 2003 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 8,630 8,210 6,900 New 1,635 1,959 2,267 Total closed (1,459 ) (1,539 ) (957 ) Pending, end of year 8,806 8,630 8,210 Closed without payment 829 805 594 61 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 5,775 6,100 7,352 New 689 1,125 954 Total closed (1,568 ) (1,450 ) (2,206 ) Pending, end of year 4,896 5,775 6,100 Closed without payment 1,115 1,006 1,776 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Other mass torts $ 203 $ 205 $ 234 Workers compensation 151 152 132 Commercial and other 245 274 135 Other discontinued lines $ 599 $ 631 $ 501 Other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures. We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2006, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves. Property Liability Reinsurance Ceded For Allstate Protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, while lessening earnings volatility and improving shareholder return, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company. We purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. We also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, and have 62 purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts. Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Industry pools and facilities $ 2,811 $ 2,217 $ 2,241 $ 1,596 Asbestos and environmental 2,457 2,708 1,003 1,045 Other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 16,849 14,413 126 86 Total Property Liability $ 22,117 $ 19,338 $ 3,370 $ 2,727 When purchasing reinsurance, we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $213 million and $230 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represent 17.3% and 16.9%, respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances. 63 The largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

At December 31, 2005, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property Liability reinsurer was in excess of $29 million. Allstate sells and administers policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). Ceded premiums earned include $199 million, $181 million and $169 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and ceded losses incurred include $3.30 billion, $171 million and $64 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for this program. Under the arrangement, the Federal Government is obligated to pay all claims. The NFIP has no impact on our net income or financial position and is included net of ceded premiums and losses with our other personal lines business. We receive expense allowances from NFIP as reimbursement for underwriting administration, commission, claims management and adjuster fees. These policies are not included in any of our core business statistics such as PIF, new net premiums written, loss ratio, combined ratio or catastrophe losses. We enter into certain inter company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. An affiliate of the company, Allstate Texas Lloyds ("ATL"), a syndicate insurance company cedes 100% of its business net of reinsurance with external parties to AIC. At December 31, 2005, ATL has $250 million of reinsurance recoverable primarily related to losses incurred from Hurricane Rita. 64 Our Allstate Protection catastrophe reinsurance has been designed to coordinate coverage provided under various treaties. As discussed below, our reinsurance program is composed of treaties that provide coverage for state specific personal lines catastrophe exposures, with various retentions and limits. In addition, in 2006 the program includes an aggregate excess agreement that limits Allstate Protections personal lines property and auto catastrophe losses for storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes in excess of $2 billion in aggregated losses up to the treaty limit of $2 billion, excluding Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from the state specific treaties are excluded when determining the retention of the aggregate excess agreement. Multi year individual state reinsurance treaties cover personal property excess catastrophe losses in seven states: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas through May 31, 2008 and Florida through May 31, 2007 (the "multi year treaties"). The annual retentions and limits on these treaties in effect since June 1, 2005 are shown in the following table. State % Placed Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Connecticut 95 $100 $ 200 New Jersey 95 100 100 New York 90 750 1,000 North Carolina 10 80 175 South Carolina 10 97 435 Texas(2) 95 320 550 Florida 90 Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(1) 900 (1)The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. (2)Reinsurance is recoverable by ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. The annual retentions and limits on the agreements expected to be in place during 2006 are shown in the following table. For further discussion of these reinsurance agreements, see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. 65  Effective Date % Placed Reinstatement/Limits Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Aggregate excess(1) 6/1/2006 95 None $2,000 $ 2,000 California fire following(2) 2/1/2006 95 2 limits over 28 month term and as noted above 500 1,500 Multi year(3): 6/1/2005 (as revised effective 6/1/2006) Connecticut 95 2 limits over 3 year term 100 200 New Jersey 95 1 reinstatement over 3 year term with reinstatement premium required 100 200 New York(4) 90 2 limits over 3 year term 750 1,000 Texas(5) 95 2 limits for each year over 3 year term 320 650 Florida 90 2 limits over 2 year term Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(6) 900 New Jersey(7) 6/1/2006 95 Excess of New Jersey Multi year treaty 300 (1)Aggregate Excess Agreement This agreement is effective 6/1/2006 for 1 year and covers storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes for the Allstate and Encompass brand personal lines auto and property business countrywide except for Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from our California fire following agreement, multi year treaties and any new New Jersey agreement are excluded when determining the retention of this agreement. (2)California Fire Following Agreement This agreement is effective 2/1/2006 and expires 5/31/2008. This agreement covers Allstate and Encompass brand personal property losses in California for fires following earthquakes. This agreement provides in total $3 billion of coverage for all qualifying losses except when a qualifying loss occurrence exceeds $2 billion, then for 21 days no additional recovery can occur for any losses within the same seismic geographically affected area. (3)Multi year Treaties These treaties have been in effect since 6/1/2005 and cover the Allstate brand personal property catastrophe losses, expiring 5/31/2008, except for the treaty in Florida. The Florida treaty provides coverage for property policies written by Allstate Floridian and it expires 5/31/2007. This chart reflects our expectation that we will expand coverage limits by $100 million per year on the New Jersey and Texas treaties effective 6/1/2006, and that we expect to terminate the existing treaties in North Carolina and South Carolina on 5/31/2006. The retentions, limits and or reinsurance premiums on these treaties are also subject to annual remeasurements on their anniversary dates. (4)Two separate reinsurance treaties provide coverage for catastrophe risks in the State of New York: AIC has a $500,000,000 retention and a $550,000,000 limit, and Allstate Indemnity Company has a $250,000,000 retention and a $450,000,000 limit. (5)The Texas treaty is with ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. (6)FHCF The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. These estimates are subject to annual remeasurements at the beginning of the FHCF fiscal year of 6/1. This is an annual program with a first season and second season coverage provision. (7)New Jersey Agreement This agreement is being contemplated, but has not yet been placed. This agreement is expected to be effective 6/1/2006. 66 We anticipate that the total cost of these agreements will be approximately $600 million per year or $150 million per quarter. This represents an increase of approximately $400 million per year or $100 million per quarter over our current cost, once these agreements are fully placed and effective. Based on the effective dates of these agreements, our costs are expected to be approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2006, $100 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. We will aggressively seek regulatory approvals, despite the challenging regulatory environment in each state, to include reinsurance costs in our premium rates in order to mitigate the impact of this increase. We currently expect that this level or a similar level of reinsurance coverage will be purchased or renewed for 2007. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Allstate Financial revenues increased 7.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. Higher net investment income, increased contract charges and higher net realized capital gains, were partially offset by lower premiums. Net income improved $170 million to $416 million in 2005 from $246 million in 2004 due primarily to a $175 million after tax charge in 2004 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related primarily to guarantees on variable annuities. Investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Contractholder fund deposits totaled $12.38 billion for 2005 compared to $13.88 billion in 2004. The decline of $1.50 billion was primarily the result of lower deposits on deferred fixed annuities and, to a lesser extent, institutional products. Paid intercompany dividends totaling $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 in conjunction with capital efficiency efforts. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a major provider of life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Allstate Financials mission is to assist financial services professionals in meeting their clients financial protection, retirement and investment needs by providing top tier products delivered with reliable and efficient service. We are pursuing the following actions and strategies to improve Allstate Financials return on equity: maintaining and developing focused top tier products, deepening distribution partner relationships, improving our cost structure through scale and efficiencies, advancing our enterprise risk management program and leveraging the strength of the Allstate brand name across products and distribution channels. The execution of our business strategies has and may continue to involve simplifying our business model and focusing on those products and distribution relationships where we can secure strong leadership positions while generating acceptable returns. This may require modifying the number and selection of products marketed (for example, through such actions as our exit from the guaranteed investment contract market and the long term care product market and the sale of our direct response distribution business in 2004); terminating underperforming distribution relationships; merging or disposing of non strategic legal entities (such as the merger of Glenbrook Life and Annuity Company into Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") in 2005 and the planned sales of five legal entities); reducing policy administration software systems; and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. 67 Our individual retail product line includes a wide variety of products designed to meet the financial protection, retirement and investment needs of our customers. Individual retail products include traditional life, interest sensitive life, supplemental accident and health insurance, variable life, fixed and variable annuities and funding agreements backing retail medium term notes. Banking products and services are also offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. Individual retail products are sold through a variety of distribution channels including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents (including master brokerage agencies and workplace enrolling agents), and financial service firms such as banks, broker/dealers and specialized structured settlement brokers. Allstate Bank products can also be obtained directly through the Internet and a toll free number. Our institutional product line consists primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors.

Contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and institutional products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues. 68 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Premiums Traditional life $ 282 $ 337 $ 402 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 197 316 413 Accident and health and other 439 392 550 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Interest sensitive life 786 729 688 Fixed annuities 65 52 37 Variable annuities 280 246 206 Institutional products 8 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 (1)To conform to the current period presentation, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified. The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 387 $ 395 $ 319 Independent agents 387 356 373 Specialized brokers 141 243 390 Other 3 51 283 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Allstate agencies 521 462 440 Independent agents 305 301 279 Broker dealers 223 199 172 Banks 53 35 15 Specialized brokers 26 27 30 Other 3 3 3 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Total premiums decreased 12.2% in 2005 compared to 2004 as lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies and traditional life products more than offset higher premiums on accident, health and other premiums. Premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies declined primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to improve our returns on new business and reflect our current expectations of mortality. Our new pricing has led to a shift in our sales mix from immediate annuities with life contingencies to immediate annuities without life contingencies, which are accounted for as deposits rather than as premiums. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily due to the absence of certain premiums in 2005 resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution 69 business in 2004. The increase in accident, health and other premiums was primarily attributable to higher underwriting retention. Total premiums decreased 23.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business, which resulted in lower accident and health and other premiums and traditional life premiums. Additionally, 2004 reflects lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies as underwriting actions taken in 2003 reduced the maximum premium received on individual contracts sold. Contract charges increased 10.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life, variable annuities and, to a lesser extent, fixed annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges were attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were primarily the result of higher account values and participation fees. Fixed annuity contract charges in 2005 reflect higher surrender charges compared with the prior year. Contract charges increased 9.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life and variable annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting contract charges, surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were the result of increased average account values during 2004, reflecting positive investment results during 2003 and 2004. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 175 basis points in 2004 from 166 basis points in 2003 driven by increases in fees charged for our variable annuity benefits on the Allstate Advisor product in addition to a higher percentage of our in force contracts providing these benefits. Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products, such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. 70 The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 55,709 $ 47,071 $ 40,751 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) 421 Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 5,926 7,322 5,266 Institutional products (primarily funding agreements) 3,773 3,987 2,713 Interest sensitive life 1,404 1,375 1,074 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 395 495 893 Bank and other deposits 883 701 681 Total deposits 12,381 13,880 10,627 Interest credited 2,404 1,991 1,846 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Maturities of institutional products (3,090 ) (2,518 ) (2,163 ) Benefits (984 ) (729 ) (505 ) Surrenders and partial withdrawals (5,098 ) (3,438 ) (2,728 ) Contract charges (698 ) (655 ) (622 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (339 ) (412 ) (416 ) Fair value hedge adjustments for institutional products (289 ) 38 131 Other adjustments 44 60 150 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (10,454 ) (7,654 ) (6,153 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 60,040 $ 55,709 $ 47,071 (1)The increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of Statement of Position No. 03 1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03 1") reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds, the reclassification of deferred sales inducements ("DSI") from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and other guarantees provided under fixed annuity, variable annuity and interest sensitive life contracts. Lower contractholder deposits and increased surrenders and partial withdrawals as well as higher institutional product maturities contributed to a reduction in the growth rate of contractholder funds in 2005 compared to 2004. Average contractholder funds increased 13.1% in 2005 compared to a 16.6% increase in 2004. Contractholder deposits decreased 10.8% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower deposits on fixed annuities. Fixed annuity deposits declined 19.1% in 2005 as lower deposits on traditional deferred fixed annuities and market value adjusted annuities were partially offset by increased deposits on immediate annuities without life contingencies. The decline in fixed annuity deposits resulted from reduced consumer demand relative to certificates of deposit and other short term investments due to increases in short term interest rates without corresponding increases in longer term rates, and pricing actions to increase fixed annuity product returns. A continuation of the current interest rate environment may limit the level of future fixed annuity deposits. Institutional product deposits decreased 5.4% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our institutional business sales remain opportunistic and, as such, institutional product deposits were intermittent during the year. 71 Contractholder deposits increased 30.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to greater issuances of fixed annuities, interest sensitive life policies and retail and institutional funding agreements. Fixed annuity deposits increased 39.0% in 2004 compared to 2003 due to strong consumer demand, competitive pricing and effective distribution efforts in our bank channel. Institutional product deposits increased 47.0% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely due to favorable market conditions for our funding agreements and the broadening of our customer base through the development and launch of our new Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") registered program in the second quarter of 2004 and our new registered retail funding agreement program in the fourth quarter. The registered programs generated $1.74 billion of new funding agreement deposits during 2004 including $85 million in retail funding agreement deposits. Surrenders and partial withdrawals increased 48.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 driven mostly by higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities due to a portion of these contracts entering a 30 45 day window in which there were no surrender charges or market value adjustments. The lack of surrender charges and market value adjustments combined with the interest rate environment, which included a relatively small difference between short term and long term interest rates, caused contractholders to choose competing short term investment alternatives. The withdrawal rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 11.6%, 9.3% and 8.6%, respectively, based on the beginning of period contractholder funds balance excluding institutional product reserves. Surrenders and withdrawals may vary with changes in interest rates and equity market conditions and the aging of our in force contracts. Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 14,377 $ 13,425 $ 11,125 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) (204 ) Variable annuity and life deposits 1,877 1,763 2,284 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (395 ) (495 ) (893 ) Net deposits 1,482 1,268 1,391 Investment results 1,060 1,348 2,393 Contract charges (283 ) (256 ) (220 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 339 412 416 Surrenders and benefits (1,740 ) (1,616 ) (1,680 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 15,235 $ 14,377 $ 13,425 (1)The decrease in separate accounts due to the adoption of SOP 03 1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds. Separate accounts liabilities increased 6.0% as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. This is compared to an increase of 7.1% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which separate accounts liabilities increased was primarily attributable to less favorable market performance and increased surrenders and benefits, partially offset by higher net deposits. Net variable annuity and life deposits increased 16.9% in 2005 compared to 2004 and declined 8.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. Variable product deposits vary with equity market conditions and consumer preferences related to our product features. Variable annuity contractholders often allocate a 72 significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds. Net investment income increased 12.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily the result of increased portfolio balances and, to a lesser extent, increased yields on floating rate assets due to higher short term interest rates and increased income on partnership interests, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities. In 2004, the increase compared to 2003 was due to higher portfolio balances partially offset by lower portfolio yields. Higher portfolio balances in both years resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities, institutional funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies. Investment balances as of December 31, 2005, increased 3.7% from December 31, 2004 and increased 15.3% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which investments increased in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a lesser increase in contractholder funds and a decline in unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities in 2005 compared with a slight increase in 2004. Changes in portfolio yields are primarily driven by purchases, including reinvestments, of fixed income securities with yields higher or lower than the current portfolio average as well as significant changes in short term interest rates. Net income analysis is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Net investment income 3,830 3,410 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 49 23 Contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (1,956 ) (1,846 ) Gross margin 1,998 1,957 1,863 Amortization of DAC and DSI (545 ) (498 ) (492 ) Operating costs and expenses (632 ) (634 ) (672 ) Restructuring and related charges (2 ) (5 ) (7 ) Income tax expense (260 ) (269 ) (243 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax 12 (3 ) (53 ) DAC and DSI amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses, after tax (103 ) (89 ) (30 ) Reclassification of periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, after tax (40 ) (32 ) (15 ) Loss on disposition of operations, after tax (12 ) (6 ) (29 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (17 ) Net income $ 416 $ 246 $ 305 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. 73 Gross margin, a non GAAP measure, represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges, net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds excluding amortization of DSI. We reclassify periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments into gross margin to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, replicated assets or product attributes (e.g. net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds) and by doing so, appropriately reflect trends in product performance. We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financials life insurance and financial product portfolio. Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin. Gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business: investment margin, benefit margin, and contract charges and fees. We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins. Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financials GAAP net income in the previous table. 74  The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following table. 2005 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 918 $ $ 918 Contract charges 631 500 1,131 Net investment income 3,830 3,830 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 63 Contract benefits (530 ) (1,085 ) (1,615 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (2,329 ) $ 1,034 $ 464 $ 500 $ 1,998 2004(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,045 $ $ 1,045 Contract charges 562 465 1,027 Net investment income 3,410 3,410 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 49 49 Contract benefits (533 ) (1,085 ) (1,618 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,956 ) (1,956 ) $ 970 $ 522 $ 465 $ 1,957 2003(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,365 $ $ 1,365 Contract charges 535 404 939 Net investment income 3,233 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 23 23 Contract benefits (517 ) (1,334 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,846 ) (1,846 ) $ 893 $ 566 $ 404 $ 1,863 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. (3)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. In connection therewith, contract charges related to guaranteed minimum death, income, accumulation and withdrawal benefits on variable annuities have been reclassified to benefit margin from maintenance charges. Additionally, amounts previously presented as maintenance charges and surrender charges are now presented in the aggregate as contract charges and fees. Further, the Allstate Workplace Division margins were conformed. These reclassifications did not result in a change in gross margin. 75 Gross margin increased 2.1% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.0% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in both periods was the result of higher investment margin and contract charges and fees, partially offset by lower benefit margin. Investment margin is a component of gross margin, both of which are non GAAP measures. Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. Amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating investment margin. We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financials profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period. Investment margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Annuities $ 683 $ 623 $ 546 Life insurance 219 212 231 Institutional products 122 121 107 Bank and other 10 14 9 Total investment margin $ 1,034 $ 970 $ 893 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Investment margin increased 6.6% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to growth in our fixed annuity business, partially offset by lower weighted average investment spreads on interest sensitive life and immediate annuities. Investment margin increased 8.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. As of December 31, 2005, 71% of our interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, had a guaranteed crediting rate of 3% or higher. Of these contracts, 79% have crediting rates that were at the minimum guaranteed rate at December 31, 2005. The approximate difference between the weighted average crediting rate and the average guaranteed rate on interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, was 46 basis points as of December 31, 2005 compared with 52 basis points as of December 31, 2004 and 70 basis points as of December 31, 2003. The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Benefit margin represents life and life contingent immediate annuity premiums, cost of insurance contract charges and variable annuity contract charges for contract guarantees less contract benefits. Benefit margin excludes the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin. We use the benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financials underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period. Benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Life insurance $ 544 $ 572 $ 654 Annuities (80 ) (50 ) (88 ) Total benefit margin $ 464 $ 522 $ 566 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Benefit margin declined 11.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our life insurance and annuity business contributed equally to the decline in 2005. The decline in our annuity benefit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and an increase in variable annuity contract benefits. The decline in our life insurance benefit margin was primarily due to the absence of margin on certain products resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the prior year and modestly unfavorable mortality experience on our traditional life business, partially offset by growth in our life insurance in force. Benefit margin decreased 7.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. This decline was primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and unfavorable mortality experience on life contingent immediate annuities, partially offset by an improved benefit margin on life insurance products and lower contract benefits related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuities. 77 As required by SOP 03 1, as of January 1, 2004, a reserve was established for death and income benefits provided under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on certain interest sensitive life contracts and fixed annuities. For variable annuities, the reserve includes GMDBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIBs"). Annuity benefit margin will continue to be adversely impacted by certain closed blocks of life contingent immediate annuities for which benefit payments are anticipated to extend beyond their original pricing expectations. The annuity benefit margin in future periods will fluctuate based on the timing of annuitant deaths on these life contingent immediate annuities and the annual evaluation of assumptions used in our valuation models for variable and fixed annuity guarantees. Amortization of DAC and DSI, excluding amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, increased 9.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher gross margin. DAC and DSI amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, after tax, increased $14 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased realized capital gains on investments supporting certain fixed annuities. In the first quarter of 2005, we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of the assumptions used in our valuation models for all investment products, including variable and fixed annuities and interest sensitive and variable life products, which resulted in net DAC and DSI amortization acceleration of $7 million (commonly referred to as "DAC and DSI unlocking"). The DAC and DSI unlocking includes amortization acceleration on fixed annuities of $62 million and $3 million on interest sensitive and variable life products, partially offset by amortization deceleration on variable annuities of $58 million. The amortization acceleration on fixed annuities was primarily due to higher than expected lapses on market value adjusted annuities and faster than anticipated investment portfolio yield declines. The amortization deceleration on variable annuities was mostly attributable to better than anticipated equity market performance and persistency in 2004. In the prior year, the comparable DAC and DSI unlocking was a net acceleration of amortization of $0.5 million, which included deceleration of amortization related to interest sensitive life and acceleration of amortization related to fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC and DSI increased 1.2% during 2004 compared to 2003. The higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities. In 2003, amortization of DAC and DSI included a net acceleration of DAC amortization totaling $89 million and $37 million of DAC amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in 2004. The adoption of SOP 03 1 in 2004 required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of DAC. Because of this new modeling approach, effective January 1, 2004, the variable annuity DAC and DSI assets were reduced by $124 million. This reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 78 The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables.

(2)The impact of adoption of SOP 03 1 includes a write down in variable annuity DAC of $108 million, the reclassification of DSI from DAC to other assets resulting in a decrease to DAC of $44 million, an increase to DAC of $8 million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from DAC to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to DAC of $10 million. (3)The amortization of DAC for interest sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of gross profits, which include realized capital gains and losses. Fluctuations in amortization for these products may result as actual realized capital gains and losses differ from the amounts utilized in the determination of estimated gross profits. Amortization related to realized capital gains and losses was $126 million and $120 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating costs and expenses declined slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased 5.7% in 2004 compared to 2003. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Non deferrable acquisition costs $ 245 $ 256 $ 286 Other operating costs and expenses 387 378 386 Total operating costs and expenses $ 632 $ 634 $ 672 Non deferrable acquisition costs declined 4.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 as the prior year included a $15 million charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. The impact of this charge was partially offset by higher premium taxes and non deferrable commissions in 2005. Other 79 operating costs and expenses increased 2.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a $28 million increase in a liability for future benefits of a previously discontinued benefit plan, partially offset by lower employee and technology expenses reflecting our continuing actions to simplify operations and reduce costs. The decline in total operating costs and expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business. Excluding the impact of the disposition, non deferrable acquisition costs increased due to higher non deferrable renewal commissions; taxes, licenses and fees; and the charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. For other operating costs and expenses, the decline due to the disposition was partially offset by higher technology and employee related expenses. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $19 million and $3 million, respectively. Net realized capital gains and losses are presented in the following table for the years ended December 31.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 49% of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. As of December 31, 2005, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 90% of the mortality risk depending on the length of the term, policy premium guarantees and the date of policy issuance. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2004, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 100% of the mortality risk. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on substantially all of our long term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. 80  The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life contingent contract benefits at December 31, are summarized in the following table. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims (in millions) 2005 2004 Life insurance $ 1,123 $ 1,010 Long term care 412 315 Other 275 271 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,810 $ 1,596 The estimation of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves. Developments in the insurance industry have included consolidation activity between reinsurers, which has resulted in reinsurance risk across the industry being concentrated among fewer companies. In 2005, we increased our percentage of underwriting retention of new term life insurance policies by approximately 10 15% on average depending on product mix. Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by reinsurer as of December 31, are shown in the following table.

We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended December 31, 2005. 81 We enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Allstate Financial Outlook Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. These strategies include continuing to proactively manage capital and focus our product portfolio on products where we can secure market leadership and achieve acceptable returns. We will continue to manage our expenses and improve our operating efficiency. We plan to reinvigorate sales through the Allstate exclusive agencies by further tailoring products for our customers and making it easier for our agents to distribute Allstate Financial products. We prioritize the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of products with the best sustainable growth and margins and to maintain a market presence for fixed annuity and life products in our retail distribution channels. Our institutional products remain opportunistic. INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. Overview and Strategy The Property Liability portfolios investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has produced competitive returns over time, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. We employ a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk/return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest. The models recommended asset allocation, along with duration and liquidity considerations, guides our initial asset allocation. This is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets. Portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. The Allstate Financial portfolios investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital. We believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. We believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time. The portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling, including a strategic asset allocation model, as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. The Corporate and Other portfolios investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure. The portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns. 82 As a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios, we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Portfolio reviews, which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery, are conducted regularly. For more information, see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolios at December 31, 2005 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information.

Cost basis for these securities was $4.48 billion, $325 million, and $68 million for Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively. (3)Balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other. Total investments increased to $118.30 billion at December 31, 2005 from $115.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating activities including increased funds associated with securities lending, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases and decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities. The Property Liability investment portfolio decreased to $39.57 billion at December 31, 2005 from $40.27 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation and payments of catastrophe claims, partially offset by positive cash flows from other operating activities. The Allstate Financial investment portfolio increased to $75.23 billion at December 31, 2005, from $72.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating, and financing activities, partially offset by decreased unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities. The Corporate and Other investment portfolio increased to $3.49 billion at December 31, 2005, from $2.73 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to additional investments made in the portfolio of Kennett Capital, Inc. ("Kennett Capital"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation, the original source of which was dividends from AIC, partially offset by the liquidation of an investment management variable interest entity ("VIE") with investments of $298 million. Total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending activities, funds received in connection with securities repurchase agreements, and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions, decreased to $4.10 billion at December 31, 2005, from $4.85 billion at December 31, 2004. 83 We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. The following table shows total investments, categorized by the method used to determine fair value at December 31, 2005. Investments (in millions) Carrying Value Percent to total Derivative Contracts Fair Value Fair value based on independent market quotations $ 92,291 78.0 % $ 69 Fair value based on models and other valuation methods 13,708 11.6 976 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership and other investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 12,298 10.4 Total $ 118,297 100.0 % $ 1,045 Fixed Income Securities See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income security for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $26.74 billion and 96.6% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Approximately 64.5% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by seven bond insurers and accordingly have a Moodys equivalent rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2005 consisted of approximately 3,500 issues from approximately 2,500 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was approximately 1% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately 8.9% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate bonds totaled $40.13 billion and 90.2% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio contained $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations, 44.2% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $17.41 billion at December 31, 2004. Approximately $15.63 billion or 88.2% of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities. The benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2005, 89.0% of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade. Foreign government securities totaled $2.95 billion and 95.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Mortgage backed securities ("MBS") totaled $9.04 billion at December 31, 2005, all of which were investment grade. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. 84 Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities ("CMBS") totaled $6.99 billion at December 31, 2005. CMBS investments primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages, broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. The CMBS portfolio is subject to credit risk, but unlike other structured products, is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages, whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates. Credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments. Approximately 82.2% of the CMBS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors rating of AAA, the highest rating category, at December 31, 2005. Asset backed securities ("ABS") totaled $8.08 billion at December 31, 2005. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral. In addition, many of the securities in the ABS portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and or insurance. Approximately 65.1% of the ABS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. A portion of the ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since, for example, price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets. The ABS portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations and other bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types, predominately home equity loans, credit card receivables and auto loans. At December 31, 2005, 94.8% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moodys or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch or Dominion; or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available.

The equity securities portfolio was $6.16 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $5.90 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase is attributable to positive cash flows from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.31 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $1.34 billion at December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized losses totaled $22 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $14 million at December 31, 2004. Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in 85 determining whether the securities are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December 31, 2005 totaled $4.58 billion, a decrease of $1.81 billion since December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector are provided in the table below.

The gross unrealized losses in these sectors were primarily company specific and interest rate related. Approximately $33 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio were associated with the automobile industry, which includes direct debt issuances of automobile manufacturers, captive automotive financing companies and automobile parts and equipment suppliers, which are reported above in the consumer goods and financial services sectors. Fixed income security values in the automobile industry were primarily depressed due to company specific conditions. Additionally, approximately $5 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and $7 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were depressed due to company or issue specific conditions and economic issues, including fuel costs. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 86 The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2005. (in millions) NAIC Rating Moodys Equivalent Unrealized Loss Percent to Total Fair Value Percent to Total 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ (396 ) 64.5 % $ 24,025 74.9 % 2 Baa (155 ) 25.2 6,718 21.0 3 Ba (34 ) 5.5 858 2.7 4 B (22 ) 3.6 354 1.1 5 Caa or lower (6 ) 1.0 71 0.2 6 In or near default (1 ) 0.2 31 0.1 Total $ (614 ) 100.0 % $ 32,057 100.0 % The table above includes 57 securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a comparable internal rating, with a fair value totaling $669 million and an unrealized loss of $14 million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, execution of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC, and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating. At December 31, 2005, $551 million, or 89.7%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired. As of December 31, 2005, $63 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 14.3% were in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2005. Included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities, through diversification of the portfolio, and active credit monitoring and portfolio management. The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers.

At December 31, 2005, the consumer goods, communications and technology sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio, which were company and sector specific. We expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate, on a case by case basis, fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list. As a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration and revisions to strategic asset allocations, and certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers, we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 88  The following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance, aging and investment grade classification.

The largest individual unrealized loss was $4 million for category (i) and $5 million for category (ii) as of December 31, 2005. 89 Categories (i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate increases and the markets evaluation of certain sectors. The degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. Categories (iii) and (iv) have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions. All of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment. We expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time. Whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12 months is temporary, additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, one security with an unrealized loss of $3 million met these criteria. The following table contains the individual securities with the largest unrealized losses as of December 31, 2005. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than $3 million or 0.5% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities.

Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future. 90 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December 31. 2005 2004 (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Problem $ 172 $ 188 0.2 % $ 150 $ 153 0.1 % Restructured 33 34 75 75 0.1 Potential problem 178 191 0.2 265 269 0.3 Total net carrying value $ 383 $ 413 0.4 % $ 490 $ 497 0.5 % Cumulative write downs recognized $ 304 $ 351 We have experienced an increase in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily related to the addition of securities to the problem category as a result of company specific issues, including the bankruptcy filings of certain airlines. The decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as restructured and potential problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was primarily related to dispositions. We evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2005 and recorded write downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio. Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Investment write downs $ (55 ) $ (129 ) $ (294 ) Dispositions 619 828 453 Valuation of derivative instruments (95 ) (46 ) 16 Settlement of derivative instruments 80 (62 ) 21 Realized capital gains and losses, pretax 549 591 196 Income tax expense (189 ) (199 ) (62 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax $ 360 $ 392 $ 134 Dispositions in the above table include sales, losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions and other transactions such as calls and prepayments. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. In certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security. Included in investment write downs were $11 million of realized losses related to airline industry holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dispositions included net realized gains on sales of 91 $827 million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of $208 million. The net realized gains were comprised of gross gains of $1.17 billion and gross losses of $341 million. The $341 million in gross losses primarily consisted of $192 million from sales of fixed income securities and $142 million from sales of equity securities. A changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level. A duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view. Tactical duration adjustments within managements approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses and through new purchases. As a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration, realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. This approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation. Because of the level of catastrophe losses experienced during 2005 and the possibility that we may need to have additional cash available to pay claims, we identified a portfolio from which we would consider selecting specific securities to sell to meet these needs. Certain of these securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $34 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in this portfolio was $13.13 billion. Because of an anticipated rise in interest rates, as well as changes in existing market conditions and long term asset return assumptions, certain changes are planned within various portfolios. These included continued asset liability management strategies, on going comprehensive reviews of our portfolios, and changes being made to our strategic asset allocations, including Property Liability duration. In addition, we decided to pursue yield enhancement strategies for the Allstate Financial portfolio. Certain of the securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $174 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in these portfolios was $1.24 billion. Gains from dispositions during 2004 include $90 million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and $49 million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the Allstate Floridian Insurance Company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims. The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $45 million with the largest being $9 million and the smallest being $3 million. None of the $45 million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale. Our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates. No other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on dispositions and 92 writedowns greater than 0.8% of the total gross loss on dispositions and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities.

(3)Losses due to a decision to decrease our exposure to two large domestic auto manufacturers and as a result of changing economic circumstances, including the decline in their overall market share. The circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios. Mortgage Loans Our mortgage loan portfolio which is primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio was $8.75 billion at December 31, 2005 and $7.86 billion at December 31, 2004, and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk. We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had no net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2005 and had $1 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short Term Investments Our short term investment portfolio was $3.47 billion and $4.13 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year. We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expense. At December 31, 2005, the amount of securities lending collateral 93 reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of $650 million. This compares to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2004. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. Overview We generate substantial investible funds from our Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business. Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight and investment activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees. For Allstate Financial, its asset liability management ("ALM") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks. ALM focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate investment risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies specify limits, ranges and or targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financials business objectives in light of its product liabilities. We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration and value at risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the ALM organization. This integration results in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return, conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of 94 Allstate Financials product liabilities and supported by the application of advanced risk technology and analytics. Although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest rate sensitive assets and issue interest rate sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations. We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2005, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.50, compared to a 0.84 gap at December 31, 2004. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. Most of our duration gap originates from the Property Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property Liability assets and liabilities. For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy may include using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers. We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $33 million as of December 31, 2005. For over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2005, we held $352 million of cash pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments and did not have any collateral pledged to counterparties. To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions 95 (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.45 billion, compared to $1.79 billion at December 31, 2004. There are $7.04 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments. These assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate. The $7.04 billion of assets excluded from the calculation has decreased from the $7.32 billion reported at December 31, 2004 due to a decrease in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $456 million, compared to a decrease of $427 million at December 31, 2004. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2005, we would recognize realized capital gains totaling $27 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $27 million in realized capital losses in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates. Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. At December 31, 2005, we held approximately $4.97 billion in common stocks and $2.03 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds, non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes), compared to approximately $4.88 billion in common stocks and $1.82 billion in other equity investments at December 31, 2004. Approximately 100.0% and 66.3% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of the Property Liability operations at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 99.8% and 65.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately 0.95, compared to a beta of approximately 0.85 at December 31, 2004. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investments market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 9.5%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 9.5%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2005, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately 96 $667 million, compared to $569 million at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $15.24 billion and $14.38 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $25 million and $24 million less in fee income at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial have a GMDB and customers may have chosen to purchase an enhanced GMDB, a GMIB from 1998 to December 31, 2003, a TrueReturnSM guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("GMAB") beginning in 2004, and a SureIncomeSM guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") beginning in 2005. These guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value. GMDBs are payable upon death. GMIBs may be exercised on or after the tenth year anniversary (not prior to 2008) of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue (not prior to 2012). GMABs guarantee an account value of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements. GMWBs may be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals. GMWBs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to 8% of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit. In January 2004, we established reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03 1. Because of this change in accounting, guarantee payments are now recognized over future periods rather than expensed as paid. For more details about this adopted accounting guidance and the calculation of the related reserves see Notes 2 and 8 of the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $1.52 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2005 and customer surrenders of contracts with in the money GMDBs. In both periods, approximately half of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining half is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in 2003 to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after January 1, 2003. A similar program was established for GMABs in 2004 and for GMWBs in 2005. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December 31, 2005 would increase by an estimated $15 million in 2006. These payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to 97 earnings as paid. Contributions to the reserve for GMDBs would increase by a nominal amount in 2006 in the event of an immediate 10% decline in account values. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model. GMIB contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variable annuity products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue. Accordingly, the earliest date at which benefits could become payable is 2008. Therefore, in the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005 due to equity market declines, contributions to the reserve would be increased by approximately $1 million in 2006. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in GMAB and GMWB contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005, due to equity market declines, there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are hedged, however the reserve for GMABs and GMWBs would be increased by approximately $10 million and $2 million, respectively. In addition to our GMDB, GMIB and GMAB equity risk, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 we had approximately $2.72 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively, in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits. Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable annuity and life contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including real estate funds and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $1.17 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively, in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $538 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $566 million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $455 million and $567 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property Liability business. Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $110 million, compared with an estimated $102 million decrease at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 98 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 34 countries, compared to 32 countries at December 31, 2004. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2005 were to the Canadian dollar (52.4%) and the Euro (14.7%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2004 were to the Canadian dollar (56.5%) and the British pound (11.0%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.2% at December 31, 2005, compared to 28.7% at December 31, 2004. The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents. See Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period, which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Net periodic pension cost in 2006 is estimated to be $331 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2005 and 2004 principally due to decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates, the impact of unfavorable investment returns from prior periods on the market related value of assets, and the amortization of actuarial losses. In each of the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $135 million in 2005 and $121 million in 2004. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poors or at least "Aa" by Moodys on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities. 99  Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $58 million in net periodic pension cost and an $1.08 billion increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2005, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $50 million in net periodic pension cost and a $867 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $45 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by $6 million as of October 31, 2005, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $41 million and a $49 million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. This non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. We made contributions during 2005 sufficient to eliminate a minimum pension liability for one of our qualified pension plans. The minimum pension liability reported at December 31, 2005 relates solely to our unfunded non qualified pension plans. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $38 million in pension cost at October 31, 2005, compared to an increase of $37 million at October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $38 million at October 31, 2005, compared to a decrease of $37 million at October 31, 2004. Changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders equity items $ 18,104 $ 19,208 $ 17,809 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,082 2,615 2,756 Total shareholders equity 20,186 21,823 20,565 Debt 5,300 5,334 5,076 Total capital resources $ 25,486 $ 27,157 $ 25,641 Ratio of debt to shareholders equity 26.3 % 24.4 % 24.7 % Ratio of debt to capital resources 20.8 % 19.6 % 19.8 % 100 Shareholders equity declined in 2005, due to net income being offset by share repurchases, decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders. Shareholders equity increased in 2004 when compared to 2003, as net income was partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. In January 2005, we commenced a $4.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2005, this program had $1.55 billion remaining and is expected to be completed in 2006. Treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity and, since 1995, we have acquired 337 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $12.39 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 84 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Debt decreased in 2005 primarily due to decreases in long term debt partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. In May 2005, we issued $800 million of 5.55% Senior Notes due 2035, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes including to fund the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005, which were repaid at their scheduled maturity, May 1, 2005. In July 2005, we liquidated our consolidated investment management VIE. As a result of the liquidation, long term debt decreased by $279 million. We plan to use existing sources of liquidity to fund the repayment of our $550 million 5.375% senior notes due in 2006. Debt increased in 2004 primarily due to increases in long term borrowings outstanding. We issued $650 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2014, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005 at their scheduled maturity on May 1, 2005. The increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of $412 million related to the deconsolidation of a VIE resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the VIE. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $413 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.22%. Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December 31, 2005. Moodys Standard & Poors A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P 1 A 1 AMB 1 Allstate Insurance Company (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. We have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida. These groups maintain separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other Allstate subsidiaries that are not part of these respective groups. The ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate distinctly to each group. 101 Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a financial strength rating no lower than B+. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company and Encompass Insurance Company of New Jersey, which write auto and homeowners insurance, are rated A by A.M. Best. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company also has a Demotech rating of A". Allstate Floridian, which writes primarily property insurance, has an A.M. Best rating of B+ with a negative outlook, and remains under review currently. The resolution of this review will be influenced by developments prior to the 2006 hurricane season, including Florida regulatory and legislative actions, Allstate and Allstate Floridian management actions, A.M. Bests assessment of the timing and nature of such developments and their view on the amount of capital and risk adjusted capitalization deemed necessary to support the ratings. Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiary, Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company, also have a Demotech rating of A. Encompass Floridian Insurance Company and Encompass Floridian Indemnity Company, both subsidiaries of Allstate Floridian, have Demotech ratings of A. In addition, AIC committed to AFIC to make as much as $375 million of additional capital available until May 31, 2006 under specified circumstances if one or more events reduce AFICs capital to below $272 million initially and to $225 million if subsequent events should occur. In December 2005, $159 million was contributed under this agreement. As of December 31, 2005, AFICs statutory surplus is approximately $233 million compared to $272 million at December 31, 2004. For Allstate Floridian, premiums written during 2005 totaled $426 million and property PIF, excluding the policies that have already been ceded to Universal, was approximately 560,000 as of December 31, 2005. The extent of Allstate Floridians management actions are expected to reduce premiums, PIF and the related amount of catastrophe exposure to a level more commensurate with Allstate Floridians surplus, which has declined in recent years due to losses incurred related to hurricanes, and consistent with its capacity to achieve an acceptable rating from A.M. Best. For examples of such actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 see the Hurricane section of the MD&A. Allstates domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings. As of December 31, 2005, AICs statutory surplus is approximately $14.8 billion compared to $16.9 billion at December 31, 2004. This decline is primarily due to the estimated catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the payment of $3.86 billion of dividends by AIC in 2005. During 2005, The Allstate Corporation committed to contribute capital to AIC. For more details about this commitment, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a companys premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AICs premium to surplus ratio was 1.8x on December 31, 2005 compared to 1.5x in the prior year. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurers risk based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurers solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2005, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions. 102 The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges. Liquidity Sources and Uses Our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table. Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Receipt of insurance premiums X X Allstate Financial contractholder fund deposits X Reinsurance recoveries X X Receipts of principal, interest and dividends on investments X X X Sales of investments X X X Funds from investment repurchase agreements, securities lending, dollar roll, commercial paper and lines of credit agreements X X X Inter company loans X X X Capital contributions from parent X X Dividends from subsidiaries X X Funds from periodic issuance of additional securities X Funds from the settlement of our benefit plans X Our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table.

Property Liability Allstate Financial Corporate and Other Consolidated (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,872 $ 4,092 $ 3,450 $ 2,502 $ 1,916 $ 2,256 $ 231 $ (540 ) $ (15 ) $ 5,605 $ 5,468 $ 5,691 Investing activities 421 (1,903 ) (2,344 ) (4,854 ) (8,039 ) (6,769 ) (718 ) (781 ) (351 ) (5,151 ) (10,723 ) (9,464 ) Financing activities 370 49 11 2,498 6,506 4,554 (3,423 ) (1,252 ) (888 ) (555 ) 5,303 3,677 Net (decrease) increase in consolidated cash $ (101 ) $ 48 $ (96 ) Property Liability Lower operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2005, compared to 2004, were primarily due to increased claim payments, partially offset by increased premiums and collections of reinsurance and other recoverables related to catastrophes. Claim payments increased as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Higher operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2004 were primarily due to increased underwriting income despite catastrophe losses in 2004 and contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans in 2004. Cash provided by investing activities increased in 2005 primarily as a result of increased proceeds from sales of securities, partially offset by lower operating cash flows and higher dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily as a result of less underwriting income being available for investment due to higher operating cash flows offset by dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash provided by financing activities was the result of borrowing under our commercial paper program. Cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation, totaling $3.86 billion, $2.49 billion and $1.27 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on this limitation, without the prior approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance, AIC will not pay dividends to the Allstate Corporation until the third quarter of 2006. We expect that AIC will have sufficient liquidity to pay estimated catastrophe claims and claims expenses from existing sources of funds including operating cash flows, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and maturities and sales of investments. We expect the loss reserves from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma to be paid during 2006. Allstate Financial Higher operating cash flows for Allstate Financial in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily related to higher investment income, partially offset by lower life and annuity premiums. Lower cash flows from operating activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid, partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2005 due to lower cash provided by financing in 2005, compared to 2004, increased proceeds from sales of securities and higher investment collections, partially offset by the investment of higher operating cash flows. Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as the investment of higher financing cash flows was partially offset by lower operating cash flow. 104 Lower cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005, compared to 2004, were primarily due to higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities, lower deposits on fixed annuities and institutional products, and increased maturities of institutional products. Increased cash flows from financing activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily attributable to higher deposits of fixed annuities and institutional products, partially offset by fixed annuity withdrawals and institutional product maturities. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financials liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2005. Approximately 15.8% of these liabilities are subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment. (in millions) 2005 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 16,546 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges(1) 24,301 Market value(2) 9,729 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 9,464 Total Contractholder funds $ 60,040 (1)Includes $8.20 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance. (2)Approximately $8.61 billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30 45 day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment, including approximately $1.60 billion of market value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during 2006. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. Depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions, the Allstate Financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods. Corporate and Other Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows, were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements. Investing activities primarily relate to activity in the portfolio of Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt, repayment of debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities. We have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines of credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2005, these sources could provide over $3.48 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can also issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent 15.0% of the consolidated investment portfolio, and $8.75 billion of mortgage loans that represent 7.4% of the consolidated investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios. The sources of liquidity for 105 The Allstate Corporation include but are not limited to dividends from AIC and $2.34 billion of investments at Kennett Capital. We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows: A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining borrowing capacity was $587 million; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily. A five year revolving credit facility expiring in 2009 totaling $1.00 billion to cover short term liquidity requirements. This facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500 million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long term debt. There were no borrowings under this line of credit during 2005. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. The capacity to issue up to an additional $1.35 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. Our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease VIE obligations. The covenant requires that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements. This ratio at December 31, 2005 was 21.5%. For quantification of the synthetic lease VIE obligations, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. We closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation, the business segments and investments. Allstate Financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its ALM organization, using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio, and components of the portfolio as appropriate, which is routinely subjected to stress testing. Allstate Protections underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity, which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses. Property Liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities, including short term investments, exchange traded common stock, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows. Discontinued Lines and Coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk. Allstate Financial and Property Liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program. Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long term debt rating of A1, A+ and a (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to non investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB /bb, a downgrade in AICs financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A , or a downgrade in ALICs financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA /A . The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 106  Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements(1) $ 4,102 $ 4,102 $ $ $ Commercial paper 413 413 Contractholder funds(2) 72,881 8,669 21,715 12,699 29,798 Reserve for life contingent contract benefits(3) 28,739 1,210 3,326 2,229 21,974 Long term debt(4) 8,790 927 534 1,180 6,149 Capital lease obligations(4) 97 12 24 24 37 Operating leases(4) 822 213 301 168 140 Unconditional purchase obligations(4) 533 225 179 98 31 Pension obligations(4)(5) 153 129 24 Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense(6) 22,117 10,368 6,288 2,317 3,144 Other liabilities and accrued expenses(7)(8) 9,941 4,113 223 159 5,446 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 148,588 $ 30,381 $ 32,614 $ 18,874 $ 66,719 (1)Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash or marketable securities. We manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. (2)Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies, bank deposits and institutional products. These amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts and bank deposits, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $72.88 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $60.04 billion included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for contractholder funds. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (3)The reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Immediate annuities with life contingencies include (i) contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or illness, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as a surrender of a policy or contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $28.74 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $12.48 billion included 107 in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for reserve for life contingent contract benefits. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (4)Our payment obligations relating to long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program. Amount differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 because the long term debt amount above includes interest. (5)Pension obligations represent planned contributions to our pension plans. (6)Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported. The reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2005, of $2.20 billion and $252 million, respectively. (7)Other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $9.94 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $4.91 billion. (8)Balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $10.96 billion and deferred income taxes of $351 million. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting. In addition, other liabilities of $172 million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain. Our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Conditional(1) $ 618 $ 552 $ 66 $ $ Other Commitments Unconditional(1) 1,176 41 653 455 27 Total Commitments $ 1,794 $ 593 $ 719 $ 455 $ 27 (1)Represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans. We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required. For a more detailed discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken. In addition, we have a senior management advisory committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC"). Although the work of the ERC is still evolving, it is responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within Allstate. In the vision of the ERC, enterprise risk management ("ERM") is a disciplined, holistic, and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which: Provides additional factors when setting strategy across Allstate 108 Identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on Allstate Manages risk consistent with Allstates risk appetite Provides greater assurance of achieving Allstates objectives Allows Allstate to achieve a return commensurate with the risks taken Effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate policies, tolerances and limits; consistent ERM practices which include risk identification, evaluation, prioritization, treatment and monitoring; and effective communication and reporting. Managers in the various business units are responsible for managing, measuring, and evaluating risks as appropriate in their respective areas and that are within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise. This would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe; managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk, duration and convexity metrics; and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement. As appropriate, consistent enterprise wide measurement standards are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning and capital management. For Allstate Protection, we are utilizing an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed, given a defined tolerance for risk. Economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk/reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our business. Future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the Allstate Financial business unit and at a consolidated level so that there is a total enterprise capability. REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December 31, 2005, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS This document contains "forward looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 109 These forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC. In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services. Risks Relating to the Property Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms and terrorism. We may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our homeowners insurance business in amounts in excess of those experienced this year, in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, and in excess of those that modelers estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion, and the Northridge earthquake of 1994 totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the CEA, and various state created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted Although, along with others in the industry, we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our personal lines homeowners exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios, such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management 110 activities, there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period. Examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability, and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable. In addition, the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state specific policy language, demand surge and loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses, which are subject to wide variation by storm. Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth We believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers, will be successful over the long term, however it is possible that they will have a negative impact on near term growth and earnings. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention will be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to reduced cross selling opportunities, new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected. Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by hurricanes. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of Texas during 2002. Although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. Our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. Other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and IBNR, after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends 111 involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, and contractual terms. External factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Management believes the estimated claim reserves related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma are appropriately established and recorded based on available facts, information, laws and regulations. However, actual results may differ materially from the amounts recorded for a variety of reasons: our policyholders ability to report and our ability to adjust claims were impeded by the extent of the devastation, the size of the area affected, and the fact that some communities were hit by more than one storm; it is particularly difficult to assess the extent of damage in the initial stages of adjusting residential property losses; our estimate for the ultimate costs of repairs may not prove to be correct because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by a hurricane; the number of IBNR claims may be greater or less than anticipated; the need to have more claims adjusters to handle the large number of claims has increased pressure on our catastrophe claims settlement management process; and litigation has been filed, which if ultimately decided against us, could lead to a material increase in our catastrophe claims and claims expense estimate. Losses from catastrophes on policies Allstate sells and administers as a participant in the NFIP program are reported in our reserves for claims and claims expense and in our reinsurance recoverable. Since the level of NFIP claim activity that we experienced in 2005 is unprecedented, in subsequent fiscal quarters we may need to increase the amount of IBNR and related reinsurance recoverable. However, because the federal government is responsible for paying all such claims, we do not expect that any such increases will affect net income or shareholders equity. Additionally, the expense allowances we receive from NFIP may ultimately be determined to be either insufficient to meet our incremental expense or may prove to be in excess of such expense. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position. Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, when 112 Allstate Protections loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases, impose rate rollbacks or require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurers ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurers ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. We are subject to assessments from state insurance facilities We are currently monitoring developments with respect to various state facilities such as guaranty funds, LA Citizens, FL Citizens, the Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association, the Mississippi Residential Underwriting Association, the Alabama Insurance Underwriting Association, the Texas FAIR Plan Association and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. The ultimate impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma on these facilities is currently uncertain, but could result in the facilities recognizing a financial deficit or a financial deficit greater than the level currently estimated. They may, in turn, have the ability to assess participating insurers when financial deficits occur, adversely affecting our results of operations. These facilities are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders. Allstate and other insurance companies writing residential property policies in Florida, including FL Citizens, must participate in the FHCF, which potentially reimburses companies for their qualifying losses at various participating percentages above required retention levels subject to maximum reimbursement amounts. Allstate and these other companies currently have reimbursement recoverable balances from the FHCF for the 2004 and 2005 hurricane losses in Florida. If the FHCF does not have sufficient funds to pay its ultimate reimbursement obligations, it has the authority to issue bonds. Such bonds are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers compensation, medical malpractice and accident and health insurance. By law, these assessments are the obligation of insurance policyholders which insurance companies must collect. Companies are required to collect the FHCF assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to the FHCF as they are collected. The exposure to assessments and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases from these facilities may not offset each other in the Companys financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years. 113 The potential benefits of implementing Tiered Pricing may not be fully realized We believe that Tiered Pricing and underwriting (including SRM which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, we may lose our competitive advantage. Further, the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our Tiered Pricing model. Furthermore, because we have been using Tiered Pricing only for the last several years, we can not be assured that Tiered Pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using Tiered Pricing will increase may not be realized. Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability Our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts, satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability. Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 114 Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread based products, such as fixed annuities and institutional products, is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid or been sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Non parallel shifts in interest rates, such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates, can influence customer demand for fixed annuities, which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segments fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. For certain products, principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products, the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields. We may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates, which could narrow spreads. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability. Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the domestic and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of Allstate Financials variable annuities. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB, GMAB and GMWB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or Allstate Financials net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to AGP and EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 115 A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. Actions taken to simplify our business model and improve profitability may not be successful and may result in losses and costs Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. Actions that we have taken and may continue to take include changing the number and selection of products being marketed, terminating underperforming distribution relationships, merging or disposing of unnecessary and or non strategic legal entities, reducing policy administration software systems, and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. The actions that we have taken and may take in the future may not achieve their intended outcome and could result in lower premiums and contract charges, restructuring costs, losses on disposition or losses related to the discontinuance of individual products or distribution relationships. Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include a savings or investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. 116 We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality We are subject to market risk, the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and, to a lesser degree, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For additional information on market risk, see the "Market Risk" section of MD&A. A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolios average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also cause the purchase of longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified. We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large company, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation, including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In some circumstances, we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we pay in judgments, settlements and litigation expenses. However, we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability, if any, or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation. Consequently, the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and, therefore, may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters. 117 We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth As insurance companies, broker dealers, investment advisers and or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation. Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 118 The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Additionally, in the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial could be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurers statutory capital; a change in a rating agencys determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurers investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurers control. The insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are A+, AA and Aa2 from A.M. Best, Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively. Several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies. Because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. As a result of the capital support agreement with AIC, in certain circumstances it could be compelled in 2006 to make a capital contribution that would be completed out of The Allstate Corporations available sources of liquidity. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the 119 payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our debt and complete repurchase programs in the timeframe expected. The occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems. In the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.  Item 7A.

It should be read in conjunction with the 5 year summary of selected financial data, consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Segment sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include: For Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and severity (average cost per claim) trends, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses and underwriting results; For Allstate Financial: premiums, deposits, gross margin including investment and benefit margins, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, expenses, operating income, and invested assets; For Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration; For financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt leverage, and return on equity; and For product distribution: profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate exclusive agencies sales of all products and services. 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Net income was $1.77 billion in 2005 compared to a net income of $3.18 billion in 2004. Net income per diluted share was $2.64 in 2005 compared to net income per diluted share of $4.54 in 2004. These declines were primarily due to catastrophes. Total revenues reached a record $35.38 billion, an increase of 4.3% compared to last year. Property Liability premiums earned increased 4.0% to $27.04 billion. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, primarily due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, with an impact to the combined ratio of 21.0 points, compared to $2.47 billion in 2004, with a combined ratio impact of 9.5 points. Allstate Financial investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Total of $2.45 billion shares of stock were repurchased during the year. Book value per share was $31.01 as of December 31, 2005 compared to $31.72 as of December 31, 2004. Return on equity declined 6.6 points to 8.4%. 24 CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Property liability insurance premiums $ 27,039 $ 25,989 $ 24,677 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges 2,049 2,072 2,304 Net investment income 5,746 5,284 4,972 Realized capital gains and losses 549 591 196 Total revenues 35,383 33,936 32,149 Costs and expenses Property liability insurance claims and claims expense (21,175 ) (17,843 ) (17,432 ) Life and annuity contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2,403 ) (2,001 ) (1,846 ) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (4,721 ) (4,465 ) (4,058 ) Operating costs and expenses (2,997 ) (3,040 ) (3,001 ) Restructuring and related charges (41 ) (51 ) (74 ) Interest expense (330 ) (308 ) (275 ) Total costs and expenses (33,282 ) (29,326 ) (28,537 ) Loss on disposition of operations (13 ) (24 ) (41 ) Income tax expense (323 ) (1,230 ) (846 ) Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust(s) (5 ) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax 1,765 3,356 2,720 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (15 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 Property Liability $ 1,431 $ 3,045 $ 2,521 Allstate Financial 416 246 305 Corporate and Other (82 ) (110 ) (121 ) Net income $ 1,765 $ 3,181 $ 2,705 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have identified five accounting policies that require us to make assumptions and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates related to these policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Investment Valuation The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on 25 either widely accepted pricing valuation models, which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs, or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities, are difficult to independently observe and quantify. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities. For investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities, net of deferred income taxes, is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a securitys fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors. For our portfolio review evaluations, we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration, revision to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions; and any dispositions planned by the portfolio managers. In these instances, we recognize impairment on securities being considered for these approved planned actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near term and long term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity. Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuers ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducement costs and related deferred tax, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. For a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness We primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, particularly in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is 26 based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. When derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transactions variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk, Enterprise Risk Management and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. DAC related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates. DAC related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximate the estimated lives of the policies. DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits which includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization periods range from 15 30 years; however, estimates of customer surrender rates, partial withdrawals and deaths generally result in the majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. AGP and EGP consist of the following components: benefit margins primarily from mortality, including guaranteed minimum death, income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses. DAC amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is estimated using stochastic modeling and is significantly impacted by the anticipated return on the underlying funds. Our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance, net of fees, was approximately 7% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 and 2003. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from the expectation, we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return 27 over a seven year period equals the long term expectation. This process is referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow the future mean rates of return including fees projected over the five year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. We periodically evaluate the results of utilizing this process to confirm that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long term mean within this time horizon. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking". For quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A and Note 2 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements. Reserve for Property Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation The Property Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date. Allstate Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the current accident year as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years. We believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. Accordingly, we believe that it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined. 28 The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, excluding the unprecedented hurricane losses experienced in 2005 which we expect will be paid during 2006, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements and the Catastrophe Losses, Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A. Reserve for Life Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation Long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. For further discussion of these policies, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A. 29 PROPERTY LIABILITY 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Premiums written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 35, reached a record $27.39 billion during 2005. Compared to 2004, premiums written increased 3.2% due to increases in the number of policies in force ("PIF") for Allstate brand standard auto of 2.9% and homeowners of 3.4% and higher average premiums. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners premiums written increased 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in 2005 over 2004. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums decreased 0.3% and 7.0%, respectively, compared to 2004. Underwriting loss for Property Liability was $636 million in 2005 compared to underwriting income of $1.83 billion in 2004 due to higher catastrophes, increased severity of current year claims and a $120 million accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit and lower favorable Allstate Protection reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable claim frequencies excluding catastrophes and lower unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years in Discontinued Lines and Coverages in 2005. The combined ratio was 102.4 in 2005 compared to 93.0 in 2004. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP, is defined below. Catastrophe losses in 2005 totaled $5.67 billion compared to $2.47 billion in 2004. The effect of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio was 21.0 and 9.5 points in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Catastrophe losses include $5.00 billion related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million for assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida ("FL Citizens"). PROPERTY LIABILITY OPERATIONS Overview Our Property Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two brands, the Allstate brand and Encompass brand. Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Underwriting (loss) income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 32, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting (loss) income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investors understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses. 30 Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting (loss) income as a percentage of premiums earned. We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods. Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned. Effect of pretax reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of pretax reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio on page 43 is equal to the Property Liability combined ratio. 31  Summarized financial data, a reconciliation of underwriting (loss) income to net income and GAAP operating ratios for our Property Liability operations for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

The Encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products while the Deerbrook brand is used for non standard auto products. The key elements of the Allstate Protection strategy are: Investing in marketing and brand awareness Improving customer experience Expanding distribution Utilizing sophisticated pricing and underwriting discipline Developing innovative and differentiated products Leveraging claims capabilities We are seeking, through the utilization of our distribution channels, our sophisticated risk segmentation process ("Tiered Pricing") and consumer marketing, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We maintain a broad marketing approach throughout the U.S. We have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on Allstate brand profitability, unit growth, retention, and sales of Allstate Financial products. We differentiate the Allstate brand from competitors through new innovative products such as Allstate&reg; Your Choice Auto. We continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brands exclusive agencies and The Good Hands&reg; Network. Tiered Pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential, and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard/non standard model. Tiered Pricing includes our Strategic Risk Management ("SRM") program, which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including, to the extent legally permissible, insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports. We continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases. As we continue to use Tiered Pricing, there is a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations, including the distinctions between standard and non standard which have become less relevant in certain states. For this reason, we believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non standard business. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers. Substantially all of new and approximately 61% of renewal business written for Allstate brand auto uses Tiered Pricing, an increase from 58% in 2004 when computed on a comparable basis. For Allstate brand homeowners, approximately 82% of new and 43% of renewal business written uses Tiered Pricing. For Allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under Tiered Pricing, our results indicate an 33 increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results. Our strategy for the Encompass brand focuses on those markets that give us the best opportunity to grow profitably, in part by using Tiered Pricing. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for PIF. As a result, percent changes in PIF, average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion. We are continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators, such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels including cost of reinsurance coverage purchased and catastrophe losses, and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes. An important element of our strategy is to manage our property catastrophe exposure to enable our shareholders to earn an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers. Although in many areas of the country we are currently achieving returns within acceptable risk tolerances, we continue to seek solutions to improve returns in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes. We will significantly reduce our catastrophe exposure over time while working to mitigate the impact of our actions on customers. We are also working for changes in the regulatory environment, including fewer restrictions on underwriting, recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property lines. Pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe) are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing. Accordingly, property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products. Actions we are taking and evaluating to attain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our personal and commercial property businesses include: additional purchases of reinsurance; increased participation in various state facilities such as wind pools; changes in rates, deductibles and coverage; limitations on new business writings; changes to underwriting requirements; non renewal; discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences; withdrawal from certain markets; and or pursuing alternative markets for placement of business or segments of risk exposure in certain areas. While actions taken will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our personal and commercial property businesses, we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines when evaluating the feasibility of their implementation. In order to assess and monitor our actions, we are considering and adopting new performance measurements for managing our property business. These measurements currently include exposure limits based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, acceptable targeted rates of return by line and by state and potential exposure to capital impairment. As part of our catastrophe management efforts, we are involved with a newly created coalition called ProtectingAmerica.org. The coalition is dedicated to raising awareness, educating the public and 34 policymakers, and offering solutions that will better prepare and protect consumers, taxpayers and the American economy from major catastrophes in a sensible, cost effective fashion. A comprehensive solution is being advanced that includes the development of government sponsored, privately funded catastrophe funds at the state and national levels; improved prevention and mitigation measures, including the adoption of more effective land use policies and stronger building codes; enhanced public education about catastrophe risk; better catastrophe relief, recovery and rebuilding processes; and a rigorous process of continuous improvement for catastrophe preparedness and response programs and processes. Premiums written, an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken during 2005 and 2004 will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned. % earned after (in millions) 2005 2004 90 days 180 days 270 days 360 days Allstate brand: Standard auto $ 3,851 $ 3,703 74.3 % 98.8 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Non standard auto 401 455 73.3 % 98.1 % 99.6 % 100.0 % Auto 4,252 4,158 74.2 % 98.7 % 99.7 % 100.0 % Homeowners 3,252 3,029 43.3 % 75.5 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 1,302 1,309 44.5 % 75.9 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Total Allstate brand 8,806 8,496 59.5 % 87.6 % 97.1 % 100.0 % Encompass brand: Standard auto 594 606 44.0 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 28 36 75.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Auto 622 642 45.4 % 76.8 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Homeowners 317 289 43.7 % 75.7 % 94.2 % 100.0 % Other personal lines 84 78 44.1 % 75.9 % 94.3 % 100.0 % Total Encompass brand 1,023 1,009 44.8 % 76.4 % 94.4 % 100.0 % Total Allstate Protection unearned premiums $ 9,829 $ 9,505 57.9 % 86.4 % 96.8 % 100.0 % 35 A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.

Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written decreased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to a decrease in new business applications of 6.9% primarily related to competitive pressures in certain states and the effects of our catastrophe risk management actions. Renewal business premiums increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in renewal average premiums. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher average new and renewal premiums primarily due to a shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos and, to a lesser extent, rate actions. The level of rate changes declined in 2005 due to frequency declines and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. Additionally, the state of New York implemented a rate reduction in July 2005 that reduced the countrywide rate impact by 0.4%. Allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003. The increase in Allstate brand standard auto PIF in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty. New business comparisons in 2004 also reflected the July 2003 implementation of our new rating plan in the California market. The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums. The rate of increase in average premium declined in 2004 due to the decrease in rate activity. The reduced level of rate changes are due to declines in frequency and severity increases below our pricing assumptions as discussed in the Underwriting Results section. For Allstate brand standard auto, 37 the countrywide rate change was 1.3% and the state specific rate change was 3.3% during 2004. For Encompass brand standard auto, the countrywide rate change was 2.8% and the state specific rate change was 4.4% during 2004. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to increases in average premium. Renewal business written premium declined in 2005 as the decline in PIF more than offset increases in average premium. The increases in average premium are primarily due to rate activity, the effect of which is declining due to a decrease in rate change activity. PIF declined in 2005 due to insufficient new business to offset declines due to decreases in the renewal ratio. Encompass brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in 2004 when compared to 2003 and renewal business premiums written decreased in 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in new PIF and rate activity. We expect the rate of decline in Encompass brand standard auto PIF to continue to moderate as we pursue growth opportunities in this channel. The following table shows the net rate changes that were approved for standard auto during 2005.

Allstate brand non standard auto new business premiums declined during 2005 due to lower new business production as agencies continued to focus on our standard auto business. Declines in Allstate brand renewal business premiums during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to lower renewal PIF and average premium. Renewal PIF decreased because new business production in prior periods was insufficient to make up for an inherently low renewal ratio in this business. The decline in average premium during 2005 when compared to 2004 is due to mix of business and a decrease in rates. In 2004, the increase in average premium declined due to the decrease in rate activity. 38 Encompass brand (Deerbrook) non standard premiums written decreased in 2005 and 2004 primarily because of declines in new business.

The increase in Allstate brand homeowners 40 PIF as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of new business. PIF is also being impacted by the non renewal of approximately 95,000 of Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiaries ("Allstate Floridian") policies to Universal or approximately 1% of Allstate brand homeowners PIF. These policies non renewed at a rate of 13% in third quarter of 2005 and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2005, and are expected to non renew at a rate of 23% in the first quarter of 2006, 28% in the second quarter of 2006 and 12% in the third quarter of 2006. The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 was the result of the increases in new business due to a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. and an increased renewal ratio, which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and increased customer loyalty. The increases in Allstate brand homeowners average premium during 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums, primarily related to increases in insured value along with rate actions taken in the current and prior years. Encompass brand homeowners new business premiums written increased in 2005 and 2004 due to increases in PIF and average premium. Increases in Encompass brand homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year and increases in insured value.

The decline was the result of increased catastrophe losses, lower favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and increased current year claim severity, partly offset by increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and lower operating costs. In 2005, claims and claims expense and the claims and claims expense ratio include the effect of $120 million or 0.4 points related to an accrual for a settlement of a worker classification lawsuit challenging our overtime exemption under California wage and hour laws ("accrual for litigation"). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A. Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $2.47 billion during 2004 compared to $1.90 billion in 2003. The increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency excluding catastrophes and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity. Claims and claims expense during 2005 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $5.00 billion, net of reinsurance and other recoveries, related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. These estimates include net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. For a further discussion of catastrophe losses, see page 45. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2005 and 2004 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Maintenance and Repair price index and the Parts & Equipment price index. In 2005 and 2004, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends. Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. In 2005 and 2004, we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year. We employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. 42 Loss ratios are a measure of profitability. Loss ratios by product, and expense and combined ratios by brand, are shown in the following table. These ratios are defined on page 30. Loss Ratio Effect of Catastrophe Losses on the Loss Ratio 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Allstate brand loss ratio: Standard auto 65.7 64.4 70.1 2.9 0.7 1.4 Non standard auto 57.8 53.9 65.6 2.6 0.9 0.7 Auto 64.9 63.2 69.5 2.8 0.7 1.3 Homeowners 110.7 67.4 63.2 70.5 29.2 21.8 Other 91.7 84.6 68.1 35.3 27.7 5.6 Total Allstate brand loss ratio 78.2 66.3 68.0 21.8 9.8 6.2 Allstate brand expense ratio 23.5 23.9 23.5 Allstate brand combined ratio 101.7 90.2 91.5 Encompass brand loss ratio: Standard auto 66.9 61.3 69.4 1.7 0.5 0.7 Non standard auto (Deerbrook) 67.2 75.8 84.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 Auto 67.0 63.1 71.2 1.7 0.6 0.7 Homeowners 77.8 63.7 76.7 30.6 16.4 16.6 Other 82.1 84.4 71.5 17.9 5.7 4.0 Total Encompass brand loss ratio 71.3 64.7 72.6 11.2 5.1 4.9 Encompass brand expense ratio 29.9 29.0 29.3 Encompass brand combined ratio 101.2 93.7 101.9 Total Allstate Protection loss ratio 77.7 66.2 68.4 21.0 9.5 6.0 Allstate Protection expense ratio 24.0 24.3 23.9 Allstate Protection combined ratio 101.7 90.5 92.3 Standard auto loss ratio increased 1.3 points for the Allstate brand and 5.6 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity more than offsetting higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included the impact of an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. The Encompass brand standard auto loss ratio in 2005 was also unfavorably impacted as a result of higher current year claim severity partially offset by lower claim frequency. Standard auto loss ratio declined 5.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Allstate brand increased 3.9 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to decreases in premiums earned, higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity partly offset by lower claim frequency. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Non standard auto loss ratio for the Encompass brand decreased 8.6 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Non standard auto loss ratio declined 11.7 points for the Allstate brand and 8.9 points for Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve 43 reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Auto loss ratio increased 1.7 points for the Allstate brand and 3.9 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes being more than offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher current year claim severity. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.6 points. Auto loss ratio declined 6.3 points for the Allstate brand and 8.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These declines were due to favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, lower claim frequency and higher premiums earned for Allstate brand, partially offset by higher current year claim severity. Homeowners loss ratio increased 43.3 points for the Allstate brand and 14.1 points for the Encompass brand in 2005 when compared to 2004. The increases were due to higher catastrophe losses, unfavorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher current year claim severity partially offset by higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency excluding catastrophes. The Allstate brand loss ratio in 2005 also included an accrual for litigation of 0.2 points. Homeowners loss ratio increased 4.2 points for the Allstate brand and declined 13.0 points for the Encompass brand in 2004 when compared to 2003. These fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency, excluding catastrophes for the Allstate brand, and higher current year claim severity. Expense ratio for Allstate Protection decreased 0.3 points in 2005 when compared to 2004 primarily due to a reduction in employee incentives due to lower financial results for 2005. In 2004, the ratio increased due to higher amortization of DAC resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table. Allstate brand Encompass brand 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Amortization of DAC 14.7 14.5 13.9 20.5 19.6 19.1 Other costs and expenses 8.7 9.2 9.3 9.1 9.0 9.9 Restructuring and related charges 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.3 Total expense ratio 23.5 23.9 23.5 29.9 29.0 29.3 The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximates the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 24.0 in 2005, 24.3 in 2004 and 23.9 in 2003. The expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to CNA Financial Corporation, which ended in the fourth quarter of 2005. The licensing fees were 1.5% of premiums written by independent agencies appointed by CNA for a period of six years after acquisition of the CNA personal lines business ("Encompass") in 1999. Allstate Protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $40 million and $6 million, respectively. 44 DAC We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting and direct mail solicitation expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the time frames in which premiums are earned. The balance of DAC for each product type at December 31, is included in the following table.

We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted. Historical Catastrophe Experience Since the beginning of 1992, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property Liability loss ratio was 7.6 points. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), FHCF or placed with a third party, such as hurricane coverage in Hawaii. The average annual impact of all catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California earthquakes, on our Property Liability loss ratio was 6.1 points since the beginning of 1992. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years 1992 through 2005 is shown in the following table. Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio Average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, and losses from California earthquakes Eastern and gulf coast states 38.0 31.4 All other 22.0 14.3 Total 30.7 23.7 Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Limitations include our participation in various state facilities, such as the CEA, which provides insurance for California earthquake losses; the FHCF, which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses; and other state 45 facilities, such as wind pools. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our participation, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities. Hurricanes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Policies in force attributable to counties along the eastern and gulf coasts, including the entire state of Florida, represented approximately 25% of total homeowners policies in force during 2005. Generally, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas. Examples of actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 to reduce our exposure in these areas include purchasing reinsurance as discussed below; a moratorium on personal homeowners new business writings and the non renewal of select policies in eight coastal counties in the state of New York; a definitive agreement with Universal whereby a portion of existing customers in Florida will have new policies available when their policies expire and are not renewed; and exiting the commercial property market in Florida beginning in May 2005. We have also received approval for homeowners premium rate increases in the state of Florida averaging 7.9% implemented in August 2005, followed by an additional rate increase averaging 18.2%, implemented in October 2005. The October rate increase is subject to review by the state regulator to the extent that the actual expense ratios, including the cost of additional reinsurance to be acquired, are less than estimated expense ratios in the rate increase filings. Further, the rate increase is subject to refund or credits to the extent the approved rate is determined to have resulted in an excessive rate for the 12 month period starting October 1, 2005. While hurricanes can also be devastating to inland areas, we anticipate that our actions will be less extensive in these areas and they will be determined based on an assessment of our local exposure. Earthquakes We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. Premiums written attributable to earthquake coverage totaled approximately $60 million in 2005. Earthquake coverage is generally written as an option or as a standard covered peril depending on policy language requirements in each state. Our current strategy is to significantly reduce earthquake exposure by limiting earthquake coverage in policies, pursuing alternative markets for placement of this coverage and purchasing reinsurance. The implementation of the alternative markets strategy is subject to the identification and negotiation of arrangements with other companies to allow our agencies to place the coverage. Our initial focus will be in states with the highest earthquake exposure. Examples of actions we have already taken in these areas include our discontinuation of writing earthquake coverage in California following the formation of the CEA in 1996, allowing our agencies to place new business earthquake coverage with another carrier in the state of South Carolina beginning in 2005 and no longer offering new optional coverage and removing optional coverage from policies in most states beginning in 2006. We also continue to evaluate purchases of reinsurance including coverage for potential assessments from the CEA. We anticipate that implementation of limitations on new and renewal optional earthquake coverage will not adversely impact either auto or homeowners production and that it will cause a relatively immaterial decline in premiums written, but will result in a material reduction of exposure from catastrophic earthquake losses. We also expect that this reduction in exposure will allow for some reduction in our capital requirements. 46  We include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2005, catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and other anticipated recoveries totaled $5.67 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $2.47 billion in 2004 and $1.49 billion in 2003. Of the $5.67 billion of catastrophe losses incurred during 2005, $5.00 billion related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and $120 million related to assessments from FL Citizens. Through February 8, 2006, approximately 78% of the property claim counts and 97% of the auto claim counts related to each of these events are closed, and we expect substantially all of our remaining estimated net losses related to the 2005 hurricane season will be paid during 2006. We had $2.89 billion of gross catastrophe related reserves held at December 31, 2005.

In addition, Allstate Floridian has reinsurance on certain personal homeowners policies in Florida with Universal. For further discussion of these reinsurance and other recoveries, see the reinsurance section of the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A and Note 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2005 our longstanding contract with Pilot Catastrophe Services ("Pilot") for additional claims adjustors aided in our ability to complete more timely claims payments. Catastrophe losses also include $120 million of accruals for two assessments from FL Citizens and $34 million from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("LA Citizens"). These entities were created by their respective states to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market and can levy an assessment on participating companies for a financial deficit. After paying assessments, we expect that our subsidiaries will be able to recoup them in part through premiums written in the state. These recoupments will be recorded as an offset to catastrophe losses in the period that the related premiums are written and are expected to be primarily recorded over the next two years. For further discussion of these assessments, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Claims and claims expense during 2004 includes estimated catastrophe losses of $2.00 billion, net of recoveries from the FHCF, related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This estimate includes net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies. Allstate Protection Outlook We expect to see continued growth of Allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased PIF resulting from increases in the number of agencies representing us, advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty, however total Allstate Protection premiums written will likely be comparable to 2005 levels due to the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on property premiums, including the impacts of increased ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance. We expect to experience a slowing rate of decline in our non standard auto product and Encompass brand standard auto while maintaining profitability in these businesses. We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results, however this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions including purchases of reinsurance. We will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for technology and reinsurance. For example, there will be an investment in claims technology of approximately $95 million over 2006, 2007 and 2008 as a result of our claims system reengineering. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including increases in benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments. 49 DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT Overview The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification. As part of its responsibilities, this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations. Summarized underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums written $ (2 ) $ 4 $ 12 Premiums earned $ 1 $ 6 $ 13 Claims and claims expense (167 ) (635 ) (574 ) Other costs and expenses (9 ) (9 ) (10 ) Underwriting loss $ (175 ) $ (638 ) $ (571 ) During 2005, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $139 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $18 million, $22 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling $463 million, and an increase of $136 million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance. See the Property Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A for a more detailed discussion. Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook We may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations. We are somewhat encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity seems to be slowing, perhaps reflecting various recent state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims. In addition, we continue to monitor the possibility of federal legislation related to these claims. PROPERTY LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income increased 1.0% in 2005 when compared to last year, after increasing 5.7% in 2004 when compared to 2003. These increases were due to higher income from partnerships and higher fixed income portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. 50 The following table presents the average pretax investment yields for the year ended December 31. 2005(1)(3) 2004(2)(3) 2003(2)(3) Fixed income securities: tax exempt 5.2 % 5.4 % 5.5 % Fixed income securities: tax exempt equivalent 7.6 7.9 7.8 Fixed income securities: taxable 5.0 5.2 5.5 Equity securities 4.8 4.6 4.4 Mortgage loans 5.5 5.5 7.7 Total portfolio 5.0 5.1 5.3 (1)Pretax yield is calculated as investment income (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the investment balances at the beginning and end of period and any interim quarters.

Property Liability Investment Outlook As a result of our recent years catastrophe experience and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation in 2005, investment income for 2006 is expected to slightly decline relative to the prior year due to lower cash flows from operating activities causing a decline in portfolio balances. Allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate due to the impact of the current interest rate environment. PROPERTY LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES Underwriting results of Property Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These 51 reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date. Reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. In the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A three year or two year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate. Reserves are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates, assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates. Over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At December 31, 2005, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $120 million in net income. A reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $120 million. For a further description of our 52 reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. For Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter. The table below shows total net reserves as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for Allstate brand, Encompass brand and Discontinued Lines and Coverages lines of business.

Unfavorable homeowner reserve reestimates in 2005 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected. In 2005, reestimates included $66 million related to 2004 hurricanes of which $31 million was the FL Citizens assessment that was accruable in 2005. These were offset primarily by late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2004 were primarily due to late reported loss development that was better than expected. Homeowners reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. Other lines reserve reestimates in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily the result of claim severity development different than anticipated in previous estimates. 54 Pending, new and closed claims for Allstate Protection, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table.

This was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected. The Allstate brand experienced $209 million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2003. This was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims. These trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations. The impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Reserve reestimates $ 613 $ 872 $ 209 Allstate brand underwriting (loss) income (437 ) 2,340 1,941 Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income 140.3 % 37.3 % 10.8 % Encompass brand Reserve reestimates in 2005 were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs. Reserve reestimates in 2004 and 2003 were related to higher than anticipated claim settlement costs. 56 The impact of these reestimates on the Encompass brand underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below.

Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders. Reserve reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2005 and for asbestos and other discontinued lines in 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Jan 1 Reserves Reserve Reestimate Asbestos Claims $ 1,464 $ 139 $ 1,079 $ 463 $ 635 $ 520 Environmental Claims 232 2 257 304 2 Other Discontinued Lines 631 26 501 172 491 52 Total Discontinued Lines and Coverages $ 2,327 $ 167 $ 1,837 $ 635 $ 1,430 $ 574 Underwriting (loss) income (175 ) (638 ) (571 ) Reserve reestimates as a % of underwriting (loss) income (95.4 )% (99.5 )% (100.5 )% Reserve additions for asbestos in 2005, 2004 and 2003, totaling $139 million, $463 million and $520 million, respectively, were primarily for products related coverage. They were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims, excess policyholders with new claims, and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions, as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity. Increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported. These trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry, which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity, and bankruptcy actions. During 2004, reserve reestimates, including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, included $150 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $22 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. During 2003, reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s, including reinsurance on 57 primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. In 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks. Our exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in nature. Direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our direct excess business. Our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro rata coverage. Our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country. 58 The table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Beginning reserves $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 $ 904 $ 635 Incurred claims and claims expense 200 139 971 463 800 520 Claims and claims expense paid (422 ) (230 ) (127 ) (78 ) (121 ) (76 ) Ending reserves $ 2,205 $ 1,373 $ 2,427 $ 1,464 $ 1,583 $ 1,079 Annual survival ratio 5.2 6.0 19.1 18.8 13.1 14.2 3 year survival ratio 9.9 10.7 16.1 13.9 11.1 10.9 Environmental claims Beginning reserves $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 $ 393 $ 304 Incurred claims and claims expense 3 2 1 2 Claims and claims expense paid (32 ) (29 ) (35 ) (25 ) (78 ) (49 ) Ending reserves $ 252 $ 205 $ 281 $ 232 $ 315 $ 257 Annual survival ratio 7.9 7.2 8.1 9.1 4.0 5.2 3 year survival ratio 5.2 6.0 4.3 5.0 4.3 5.0 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Annual survival ratio 5.4 6.1 16.7 16.4 9.5 10.7 3 year survival ratio 9.0 9.7 12.5 11.2 8.8 8.9 Percentage of IBNR in ending reserves 68.0 % 61.6 % 59.9 % The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. In 2005, the asbestos survival ratio declined due to an increase in claims paid, primarily due to commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn caused reduced reserve levels. In 2004, the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. In 2004, the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments. 59  The total commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2005, 2004 and 2003 excluding these commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements, are represented in the following table. 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except ratios) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 322 $ 176 $ 32 $ 22 $ 54 $ 33 Annual survival ratio 21.1 24.9 25.2 25.5 22.7 24.2 3 year survival ratio 24.7 26.8 31.7 28.4 21.9 22.2 Environmental claims Commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 13 $ 13 $ 22 $ 14 $ 42 $ 24 Annual survival ratio 13.7 13.1 21.7 20.7 8.4 10.0 3 year survival ratio 13.1 13.2 9.7 10.0 7.7 8.4 Combined environmental and asbestos claims Total commutations, policy buy backs & settlement agreements $ 335 $ 189 $ 54 $ 36 $ 96 $ 57 Annual survival ratio 20.0 22.2 24.8 24.7 17.7 19.0 3 year survival ratio 22.6 23.6 25.6 22.6 16.7 16.9 Our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy as it determines a more normalized survival ratio by measuring the impact over three years and by excluding from payments amounts no longer carried in the reserves and not viewed in this ratio as a continuing payment level. Now at 26.8 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2005, we consider it to represent a strong reserve position. A one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2005 would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately $33 million. Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions) Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Active Policy holders Net Reserves % of Reserves Direct policyholders: Primary 46 $ 18 1 % 52 $ 23 2 % 52 $ 28 3 % Excess 333 180 13 322 297 20 286 201 19 Total 379 198 14 % 374 320 22 % 338 229 22 % Assumed reinsurance 215 16 222 15 191 17 IBNR claims 960 70 922 63 659 61 Total net reserves $ 1,373 100 % $ 1,464 100 % $ 1,079 100 % Total reserve additions $ 139 $ 463 $ 514 (1) (1)Excludes a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. 60 During the last three years, 186 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 87 policyholders were closed, increasing the number of active policyholders by 99 during the period. The 99 increase comprised 5 from 2005, 36 from 2004 and 58 from 2003. The increase of 5 from 2005 included 37 new policyholders reporting new claims and 32 policyholders claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2005, totaled $139 million and included the following factors: Direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by $5 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis. Direct excess insurance net reserves decreased by $117 million as a result of significant settlement activity including two major settlements during the fourth quarter of 2005. Assumed reinsurance net reserves decreased by $7 million due to a significant commutation that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. The number of reported new claims is shown in the following table. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 New Claims(1) 256 361 265 (1)New claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies. IBNR net reserves increased by $38 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2005 IBNR represented 70% of total asbestos reserves, 7 points higher than at December 31, 2004. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new insurance policyholders and ceding companies. Our non products case reserves represent approximately 5% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure. For environmental exposures, a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The analysis performed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Pending, new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table. Number of Claims 2005 2004 2003 Asbestos Pending, beginning of year 8,630 8,210 6,900 New 1,635 1,959 2,267 Total closed (1,459 ) (1,539 ) (957 ) Pending, end of year 8,806 8,630 8,210 Closed without payment 829 805 594 61 Environmental Pending, beginning of year 5,775 6,100 7,352 New 689 1,125 954 Total closed (1,568 ) (1,450 ) (2,206 ) Pending, end of year 4,896 5,775 6,100 Closed without payment 1,115 1,006 1,776 Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Other Discontinued Lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, and are presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Other mass torts $ 203 $ 205 $ 234 Workers compensation 151 152 132 Commercial and other 245 274 135 Other discontinued lines $ 599 $ 631 $ 501 Other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures. We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive "ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2006, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves. Property Liability Reinsurance Ceded For Allstate Protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, while lessening earnings volatility and improving shareholder return, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company. We purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. We also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, and have 62 purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts. Gross claims and claims expense reserves Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims, net (in millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Industry pools and facilities $ 2,811 $ 2,217 $ 2,241 $ 1,596 Asbestos and environmental 2,457 2,708 1,003 1,045 Other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 16,849 14,413 126 86 Total Property Liability $ 22,117 $ 19,338 $ 3,370 $ 2,727 When purchasing reinsurance, we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. Adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $213 million and $230 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represent 17.3% and 16.9%, respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances. 63 The largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

At December 31, 2005, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property Liability reinsurer was in excess of $29 million. Allstate sells and administers policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). Ceded premiums earned include $199 million, $181 million and $169 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and ceded losses incurred include $3.30 billion, $171 million and $64 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for this program. Under the arrangement, the Federal Government is obligated to pay all claims. The NFIP has no impact on our net income or financial position and is included net of ceded premiums and losses with our other personal lines business. We receive expense allowances from NFIP as reimbursement for underwriting administration, commission, claims management and adjuster fees. These policies are not included in any of our core business statistics such as PIF, new net premiums written, loss ratio, combined ratio or catastrophe losses. We enter into certain inter company insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. An affiliate of the company, Allstate Texas Lloyds ("ATL"), a syndicate insurance company cedes 100% of its business net of reinsurance with external parties to AIC. At December 31, 2005, ATL has $250 million of reinsurance recoverable primarily related to losses incurred from Hurricane Rita. 64 Our Allstate Protection catastrophe reinsurance has been designed to coordinate coverage provided under various treaties. As discussed below, our reinsurance program is composed of treaties that provide coverage for state specific personal lines catastrophe exposures, with various retentions and limits. In addition, in 2006 the program includes an aggregate excess agreement that limits Allstate Protections personal lines property and auto catastrophe losses for storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes in excess of $2 billion in aggregated losses up to the treaty limit of $2 billion, excluding Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from the state specific treaties are excluded when determining the retention of the aggregate excess agreement. Multi year individual state reinsurance treaties cover personal property excess catastrophe losses in seven states: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas through May 31, 2008 and Florida through May 31, 2007 (the "multi year treaties"). The annual retentions and limits on these treaties in effect since June 1, 2005 are shown in the following table. State % Placed Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Connecticut 95 $100 $ 200 New Jersey 95 100 100 New York 90 750 1,000 North Carolina 10 80 175 South Carolina 10 97 435 Texas(2) 95 320 550 Florida 90 Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(1) 900 (1)The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. (2)Reinsurance is recoverable by ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. The annual retentions and limits on the agreements expected to be in place during 2006 are shown in the following table. For further discussion of these reinsurance agreements, see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. 65  Effective Date % Placed Reinstatement/Limits Annual Retention (in millions) Limit (in millions) Aggregate excess(1) 6/1/2006 95 None $2,000 $ 2,000 California fire following(2) 2/1/2006 95 2 limits over 28 month term and as noted above 500 1,500 Multi year(3): 6/1/2005 (as revised effective 6/1/2006) Connecticut 95 2 limits over 3 year term 100 200 New Jersey 95 1 reinstatement over 3 year term with reinstatement premium required 100 200 New York(4) 90 2 limits over 3 year term 750 1,000 Texas(5) 95 2 limits for each year over 3 year term 320 650 Florida 90 2 limits over 2 year term Excess of FHCF Reimbursement(6) 900 New Jersey(7) 6/1/2006 95 Excess of New Jersey Multi year treaty 300 (1)Aggregate Excess Agreement This agreement is effective 6/1/2006 for 1 year and covers storms named or numbered by the National Weather Service, earthquakes, and fires following earthquakes for the Allstate and Encompass brand personal lines auto and property business countrywide except for Florida. Losses recovered, if any, from our California fire following agreement, multi year treaties and any new New Jersey agreement are excluded when determining the retention of this agreement. (2)California Fire Following Agreement This agreement is effective 2/1/2006 and expires 5/31/2008. This agreement covers Allstate and Encompass brand personal property losses in California for fires following earthquakes. This agreement provides in total $3 billion of coverage for all qualifying losses except when a qualifying loss occurrence exceeds $2 billion, then for 21 days no additional recovery can occur for any losses within the same seismic geographically affected area. (3)Multi year Treaties These treaties have been in effect since 6/1/2005 and cover the Allstate brand personal property catastrophe losses, expiring 5/31/2008, except for the treaty in Florida. The Florida treaty provides coverage for property policies written by Allstate Floridian and it expires 5/31/2007. This chart reflects our expectation that we will expand coverage limits by $100 million per year on the New Jersey and Texas treaties effective 6/1/2006, and that we expect to terminate the existing treaties in North Carolina and South Carolina on 5/31/2006. The retentions, limits and or reinsurance premiums on these treaties are also subject to annual remeasurements on their anniversary dates. (4)Two separate reinsurance treaties provide coverage for catastrophe risks in the State of New York: AIC has a $500,000,000 retention and a $550,000,000 limit, and Allstate Indemnity Company has a $250,000,000 retention and a $450,000,000 limit. (5)The Texas treaty is with ATL, a syndicate insurance company. ATL also has a 100% reinsurance agreement with AIC covering losses in excess of and or not reinsured by the Texas treaty. (6)FHCF The FHCF provides 90% reimbursement of qualifying personal property losses up to an estimated maximum. Currently, this maximum is estimated to be $945 million in excess of Allstates retention of $262 million for the two largest hurricanes and $87 million for other hurricanes. These estimates are subject to annual remeasurements at the beginning of the FHCF fiscal year of 6/1. This is an annual program with a first season and second season coverage provision. (7)New Jersey Agreement This agreement is being contemplated, but has not yet been placed. This agreement is expected to be effective 6/1/2006. 66 We anticipate that the total cost of these agreements will be approximately $600 million per year or $150 million per quarter. This represents an increase of approximately $400 million per year or $100 million per quarter over our current cost, once these agreements are fully placed and effective. Based on the effective dates of these agreements, our costs are expected to be approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2006, $100 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. We will aggressively seek regulatory approvals, despite the challenging regulatory environment in each state, to include reinsurance costs in our premium rates in order to mitigate the impact of this increase. We currently expect that this level or a similar level of reinsurance coverage will be purchased or renewed for 2007. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Allstate Financial revenues increased 7.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. Higher net investment income, increased contract charges and higher net realized capital gains, were partially offset by lower premiums. Net income improved $170 million to $416 million in 2005 from $246 million in 2004 due primarily to a $175 million after tax charge in 2004 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related primarily to guarantees on variable annuities. Investments including separate account assets as of December 31, 2005 increased 4.1% over December 31, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements. Contractholder fund deposits totaled $12.38 billion for 2005 compared to $13.88 billion in 2004. The decline of $1.50 billion was primarily the result of lower deposits on deferred fixed annuities and, to a lesser extent, institutional products. Paid intercompany dividends totaling $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 in conjunction with capital efficiency efforts. ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT Overview and Strategy The Allstate Financial segment is a major provider of life insurance, retirement and investment products to individual and institutional customers. Allstate Financials mission is to assist financial services professionals in meeting their clients financial protection, retirement and investment needs by providing top tier products delivered with reliable and efficient service. We are pursuing the following actions and strategies to improve Allstate Financials return on equity: maintaining and developing focused top tier products, deepening distribution partner relationships, improving our cost structure through scale and efficiencies, advancing our enterprise risk management program and leveraging the strength of the Allstate brand name across products and distribution channels. The execution of our business strategies has and may continue to involve simplifying our business model and focusing on those products and distribution relationships where we can secure strong leadership positions while generating acceptable returns. This may require modifying the number and selection of products marketed (for example, through such actions as our exit from the guaranteed investment contract market and the long term care product market and the sale of our direct response distribution business in 2004); terminating underperforming distribution relationships; merging or disposing of non strategic legal entities (such as the merger of Glenbrook Life and Annuity Company into Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") in 2005 and the planned sales of five legal entities); reducing policy administration software systems; and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. 67 Our individual retail product line includes a wide variety of products designed to meet the financial protection, retirement and investment needs of our customers. Individual retail products include traditional life, interest sensitive life, supplemental accident and health insurance, variable life, fixed and variable annuities and funding agreements backing retail medium term notes. Banking products and services are also offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. Individual retail products are sold through a variety of distribution channels including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents (including master brokerage agencies and workplace enrolling agents), and financial service firms such as banks, broker/dealers and specialized structured settlement brokers. Allstate Bank products can also be obtained directly through the Internet and a toll free number. Our institutional product line consists primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors. Summarized financial data for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Net investment income 3,830 3,410 3,233 Realized capital gains and losses 19 1 (85 ) Total revenues 5,898 5,483 5,452 Costs and expenses Life and annuity contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds (2,403 ) (2,001 ) (1,846 ) Amortization of DAC (629 ) (591 ) (538 ) Operating costs and expenses (632 ) (634 ) (672 ) Restructuring and related charges (2 ) (5 ) (7 ) Total costs and expenses (5,281 ) (4,849 ) (4,914 ) Loss on disposition of operations (13 ) (24 ) (46 ) Income tax expense (188 ) (189 ) (170 ) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax 416 421 322 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (17 ) Net income $ 416 $ 246 $ 305 Investments $ 75,233 $ 72,530 $ 62,895 Separate accounts assets 15,235 14,377 13,425 Investments, including Separate accounts assets $ 90,468 $ 86,907 $ 76,320 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life, immediate annuities with life contingencies, accident and health and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life, variable annuities, fixed annuities and institutional products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues. 68 The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Premiums Traditional life $ 282 $ 337 $ 402 Immediate annuities with life contingencies 197 316 413 Accident and health and other 439 392 550 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Interest sensitive life 786 729 688 Fixed annuities 65 52 37 Variable annuities 280 246 206 Institutional products 8 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 (1)To conform to the current period presentation, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified. The following table summarizes premiums and contract charges by distribution channel. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Premiums Allstate agencies $ 387 $ 395 $ 319 Independent agents 387 356 373 Specialized brokers 141 243 390 Other 3 51 283 Total premiums 918 1,045 1,365 Contract charges Allstate agencies 521 462 440 Independent agents 305 301 279 Broker dealers 223 199 172 Banks 53 35 15 Specialized brokers 26 27 30 Other 3 3 3 Total contract charges 1,131 1,027 939 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Total premiums decreased 12.2% in 2005 compared to 2004 as lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies and traditional life products more than offset higher premiums on accident, health and other premiums. Premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies declined primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to improve our returns on new business and reflect our current expectations of mortality. Our new pricing has led to a shift in our sales mix from immediate annuities with life contingencies to immediate annuities without life contingencies, which are accounted for as deposits rather than as premiums. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily due to the absence of certain premiums in 2005 resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution 69 business in 2004. The increase in accident, health and other premiums was primarily attributable to higher underwriting retention. Total premiums decreased 23.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business, which resulted in lower accident and health and other premiums and traditional life premiums. Additionally, 2004 reflects lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies as underwriting actions taken in 2003 reduced the maximum premium received on individual contracts sold. Contract charges increased 10.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life, variable annuities and, to a lesser extent, fixed annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges were attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were primarily the result of higher account values and participation fees. Fixed annuity contract charges in 2005 reflect higher surrender charges compared with the prior year. Contract charges increased 9.4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life and variable annuities. The increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges was attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting contract charges, surrenders and benefits. Higher variable annuity contract charges were the result of increased average account values during 2004, reflecting positive investment results during 2003 and 2004. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 175 basis points in 2004 from 166 basis points in 2003 driven by increases in fees charged for our variable annuity benefits on the Allstate Advisor product in addition to a higher percentage of our in force contracts providing these benefits. Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products, such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, bank deposits and funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. 70 The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Contractholder funds, beginning balance $ 55,709 $ 47,071 $ 40,751 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) 421 Deposits Fixed annuities (immediate and deferred) 5,926 7,322 5,266 Institutional products (primarily funding agreements) 3,773 3,987 2,713 Interest sensitive life 1,404 1,375 1,074 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts 395 495 893 Bank and other deposits 883 701 681 Total deposits 12,381 13,880 10,627 Interest credited 2,404 1,991 1,846 Maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments Maturities of institutional products (3,090 ) (2,518 ) (2,163 ) Benefits (984 ) (729 ) (505 ) Surrenders and partial withdrawals (5,098 ) (3,438 ) (2,728 ) Contract charges (698 ) (655 ) (622 ) Net transfers to separate accounts (339 ) (412 ) (416 ) Fair value hedge adjustments for institutional products (289 ) 38 131 Other adjustments 44 60 150 Total maturities, benefits, withdrawals and other adjustments (10,454 ) (7,654 ) (6,153 ) Contractholder funds, ending balance $ 60,040 $ 55,709 $ 47,071 (1)The increase in contractholder funds due to the adoption of Statement of Position No. 03 1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03 1") reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds, the reclassification of deferred sales inducements ("DSI") from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and other guarantees provided under fixed annuity, variable annuity and interest sensitive life contracts. Lower contractholder deposits and increased surrenders and partial withdrawals as well as higher institutional product maturities contributed to a reduction in the growth rate of contractholder funds in 2005 compared to 2004. Average contractholder funds increased 13.1% in 2005 compared to a 16.6% increase in 2004. Contractholder deposits decreased 10.8% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower deposits on fixed annuities. Fixed annuity deposits declined 19.1% in 2005 as lower deposits on traditional deferred fixed annuities and market value adjusted annuities were partially offset by increased deposits on immediate annuities without life contingencies. The decline in fixed annuity deposits resulted from reduced consumer demand relative to certificates of deposit and other short term investments due to increases in short term interest rates without corresponding increases in longer term rates, and pricing actions to increase fixed annuity product returns. A continuation of the current interest rate environment may limit the level of future fixed annuity deposits. Institutional product deposits decreased 5.4% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our institutional business sales remain opportunistic and, as such, institutional product deposits were intermittent during the year. 71 Contractholder deposits increased 30.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to greater issuances of fixed annuities, interest sensitive life policies and retail and institutional funding agreements. Fixed annuity deposits increased 39.0% in 2004 compared to 2003 due to strong consumer demand, competitive pricing and effective distribution efforts in our bank channel. Institutional product deposits increased 47.0% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely due to favorable market conditions for our funding agreements and the broadening of our customer base through the development and launch of our new Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") registered program in the second quarter of 2004 and our new registered retail funding agreement program in the fourth quarter. The registered programs generated $1.74 billion of new funding agreement deposits during 2004 including $85 million in retail funding agreement deposits. Surrenders and partial withdrawals increased 48.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 driven mostly by higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities due to a portion of these contracts entering a 30 45 day window in which there were no surrender charges or market value adjustments. The lack of surrender charges and market value adjustments combined with the interest rate environment, which included a relatively small difference between short term and long term interest rates, caused contractholders to choose competing short term investment alternatives. The withdrawal rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 11.6%, 9.3% and 8.6%, respectively, based on the beginning of period contractholder funds balance excluding institutional product reserves. Surrenders and withdrawals may vary with changes in interest rates and equity market conditions and the aging of our in force contracts. Separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Separate accounts liabilities, beginning balance $ 14,377 $ 13,425 $ 11,125 Impact of adoption of SOP 03 1(1) (204 ) Variable annuity and life deposits 1,877 1,763 2,284 Variable annuity and life deposits allocated to fixed accounts (395 ) (495 ) (893 ) Net deposits 1,482 1,268 1,391 Investment results 1,060 1,348 2,393 Contract charges (283 ) (256 ) (220 ) Net transfers from fixed accounts 339 412 416 Surrenders and benefits (1,740 ) (1,616 ) (1,680 ) Separate accounts liabilities, ending balance $ 15,235 $ 14,377 $ 13,425 (1)The decrease in separate accounts due to the adoption of SOP 03 1 reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds. Separate accounts liabilities increased 6.0% as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. This is compared to an increase of 7.1% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which separate accounts liabilities increased was primarily attributable to less favorable market performance and increased surrenders and benefits, partially offset by higher net deposits. Net variable annuity and life deposits increased 16.9% in 2005 compared to 2004 and declined 8.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. Variable product deposits vary with equity market conditions and consumer preferences related to our product features. Variable annuity contractholders often allocate a 72 significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds. Net investment income increased 12.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily the result of increased portfolio balances and, to a lesser extent, increased yields on floating rate assets due to higher short term interest rates and increased income on partnership interests, partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities. In 2004, the increase compared to 2003 was due to higher portfolio balances partially offset by lower portfolio yields. Higher portfolio balances in both years resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities, institutional funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies. Investment balances as of December 31, 2005, increased 3.7% from December 31, 2004 and increased 15.3% as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The decline in the rate at which investments increased in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a lesser increase in contractholder funds and a decline in unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities in 2005 compared with a slight increase in 2004. Changes in portfolio yields are primarily driven by purchases, including reinvestments, of fixed income securities with yields higher or lower than the current portfolio average as well as significant changes in short term interest rates. Net income analysis is presented in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Life and annuity premiums and contract charges $ 2,049 $ 2,072 $ 2,304 Net investment income 3,830 3,410 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 49 23 Contract benefits (1,615 ) (1,618 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (1,956 ) (1,846 ) Gross margin 1,998 1,957 1,863 Amortization of DAC and DSI (545 ) (498 ) (492 ) Operating costs and expenses (632 ) (634 ) (672 ) Restructuring and related charges (2 ) (5 ) (7 ) Income tax expense (260 ) (269 ) (243 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax 12 (3 ) (53 ) DAC and DSI amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses, after tax (103 ) (89 ) (30 ) Reclassification of periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, after tax (40 ) (32 ) (15 ) Loss on disposition of operations, after tax (12 ) (6 ) (29 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after tax (175 ) (17 ) Net income $ 416 $ 246 $ 305 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. 73 Gross margin, a non GAAP measure, represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges, net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds excluding amortization of DSI. We reclassify periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments into gross margin to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, replicated assets or product attributes (e.g. net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds) and by doing so, appropriately reflect trends in product performance. We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financials life insurance and financial product portfolio. Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin. Gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business: investment margin, benefit margin, and contract charges and fees. We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins. Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financials GAAP net income in the previous table. 74  The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following table. 2005 (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 918 $ $ 918 Contract charges 631 500 1,131 Net investment income 3,830 3,830 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 63 63 Contract benefits (530 ) (1,085 ) (1,615 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (2,329 ) (2,329 ) $ 1,034 $ 464 $ 500 $ 1,998 2004(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,045 $ $ 1,045 Contract charges 562 465 1,027 Net investment income 3,410 3,410 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 49 49 Contract benefits (533 ) (1,085 ) (1,618 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,956 ) (1,956 ) $ 970 $ 522 $ 465 $ 1,957 2003(3) (in millions) Investment Margin Benefit Margin Contract Charges and Fees Gross Margin Life and annuity premiums $ $ 1,365 $ $ 1,365 Contract charges 535 404 939 Net investment income 3,233 3,233 Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments(1) 23 23 Contract benefits (517 ) (1,334 ) (1,851 ) Interest credited to contractholder funds(2) (1,846 ) (1,846 ) $ 893 $ 566 $ 404 $ 1,863 (1)Periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments are reflected as a component of realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2)Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $74 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Prior periods have not been restated. (3)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. In connection therewith, contract charges related to guaranteed minimum death, income, accumulation and withdrawal benefits on variable annuities have been reclassified to benefit margin from maintenance charges. Additionally, amounts previously presented as maintenance charges and surrender charges are now presented in the aggregate as contract charges and fees. Further, the Allstate Workplace Division margins were conformed. These reclassifications did not result in a change in gross margin. 75 Gross margin increased 2.1% in 2005 compared to 2004 and 5.0% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in both periods was the result of higher investment margin and contract charges and fees, partially offset by lower benefit margin. Investment margin is a component of gross margin, both of which are non GAAP measures. Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life contingent contract benefits. Amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating investment margin. We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financials profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period. Investment margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Annuities $ 683 $ 623 $ 546 Life insurance 219 212 231 Institutional products 122 121 107 Bank and other 10 14 9 Total investment margin $ 1,034 $ 970 $ 893 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Investment margin increased 6.6% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to growth in our fixed annuity business, partially offset by lower weighted average investment spreads on interest sensitive life and immediate annuities. Investment margin increased 8.6% in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. As of December 31, 2005, 71% of our interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, had a guaranteed crediting rate of 3% or higher. Of these contracts, 79% have crediting rates that were at the minimum guaranteed rate at December 31, 2005. The approximate difference between the weighted average crediting rate and the average guaranteed rate on interest sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities and equity indexed annuities, was 46 basis points as of December 31, 2005 compared with 52 basis points as of December 31, 2004 and 70 basis points as of December 31, 2003. The following table summarizes the annualized weighted average investment yield, interest crediting rates and investment spreads during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Benefit margin represents life and life contingent immediate annuity premiums, cost of insurance contract charges and variable annuity contract charges for contract guarantees less contract benefits. Benefit margin excludes the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin. We use the benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financials underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period. Benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table. (in millions) 2005 2004(1) 2003(1) Life insurance $ 544 $ 572 $ 654 Annuities (80 ) (50 ) (88 ) Total benefit margin $ 464 $ 522 $ 566 (1)2004 and 2003 have been restated to conform to the current period presentation. Benefit margin declined 11.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. Our life insurance and annuity business contributed equally to the decline in 2005. The decline in our annuity benefit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and an increase in variable annuity contract benefits. The decline in our life insurance benefit margin was primarily due to the absence of margin on certain products resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the prior year and modestly unfavorable mortality experience on our traditional life business, partially offset by growth in our life insurance in force. Benefit margin decreased 7.8% in 2004 compared to 2003. This decline was primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and unfavorable mortality experience on life contingent immediate annuities, partially offset by an improved benefit margin on life insurance products and lower contract benefits related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuities. 77 As required by SOP 03 1, as of January 1, 2004, a reserve was established for death and income benefits provided under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on certain interest sensitive life contracts and fixed annuities. For variable annuities, the reserve includes GMDBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIBs"). Annuity benefit margin will continue to be adversely impacted by certain closed blocks of life contingent immediate annuities for which benefit payments are anticipated to extend beyond their original pricing expectations. The annuity benefit margin in future periods will fluctuate based on the timing of annuitant deaths on these life contingent immediate annuities and the annual evaluation of assumptions used in our valuation models for variable and fixed annuity guarantees. Amortization of DAC and DSI, excluding amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, increased 9.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher gross margin. DAC and DSI amortization related to realized capital gains and losses, after tax, increased $14 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased realized capital gains on investments supporting certain fixed annuities. In the first quarter of 2005, we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of the assumptions used in our valuation models for all investment products, including variable and fixed annuities and interest sensitive and variable life products, which resulted in net DAC and DSI amortization acceleration of $7 million (commonly referred to as "DAC and DSI unlocking"). The DAC and DSI unlocking includes amortization acceleration on fixed annuities of $62 million and $3 million on interest sensitive and variable life products, partially offset by amortization deceleration on variable annuities of $58 million. The amortization acceleration on fixed annuities was primarily due to higher than expected lapses on market value adjusted annuities and faster than anticipated investment portfolio yield declines. The amortization deceleration on variable annuities was mostly attributable to better than anticipated equity market performance and persistency in 2004. In the prior year, the comparable DAC and DSI unlocking was a net acceleration of amortization of $0.5 million, which included deceleration of amortization related to interest sensitive life and acceleration of amortization related to fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC and DSI increased 1.2% during 2004 compared to 2003. The higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities. In 2003, amortization of DAC and DSI included a net acceleration of DAC amortization totaling $89 million and $37 million of DAC amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in 2004. The adoption of SOP 03 1 in 2004 required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of DAC. Because of this new modeling approach, effective January 1, 2004, the variable annuity DAC and DSI assets were reduced by $124 million. This reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 78 The changes in the DAC asset are summarized in the following tables.

(2)The impact of adoption of SOP 03 1 includes a write down in variable annuity DAC of $108 million, the reclassification of DSI from DAC to other assets resulting in a decrease to DAC of $44 million, an increase to DAC of $8 million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from DAC to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to DAC of $10 million. (3)The amortization of DAC for interest sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of gross profits, which include realized capital gains and losses. Fluctuations in amortization for these products may result as actual realized capital gains and losses differ from the amounts utilized in the determination of estimated gross profits. Amortization related to realized capital gains and losses was $126 million and $120 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating costs and expenses declined slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased 5.7% in 2004 compared to 2003. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Non deferrable acquisition costs $ 245 $ 256 $ 286 Other operating costs and expenses 387 378 386 Total operating costs and expenses $ 632 $ 634 $ 672 Non deferrable acquisition costs declined 4.3% in 2005 compared to 2004 as the prior year included a $15 million charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. The impact of this charge was partially offset by higher premium taxes and non deferrable commissions in 2005. Other 79 operating costs and expenses increased 2.4% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a $28 million increase in a liability for future benefits of a previously discontinued benefit plan, partially offset by lower employee and technology expenses reflecting our continuing actions to simplify operations and reduce costs. The decline in total operating costs and expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business. Excluding the impact of the disposition, non deferrable acquisition costs increased due to higher non deferrable renewal commissions; taxes, licenses and fees; and the charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies. For other operating costs and expenses, the decline due to the disposition was partially offset by higher technology and employee related expenses. Net income was favorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by adjustments of prior years tax liabilities totaling $19 million and $3 million, respectively.

Reinsurance Ceded We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 49% of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. As of December 31, 2005, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 90% of the mortality risk depending on the length of the term, policy premium guarantees and the date of policy issuance. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2004, for certain term life insurance policies, we ceded 25 100% of the mortality risk. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on substantially all of our long term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed $2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain in force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. 80  The impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for life contingent contract benefits at December 31, are summarized in the following table. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims (in millions) 2005 2004 Life insurance $ 1,123 $ 1,010 Long term care 412 315 Other 275 271 Total Allstate Financial $ 1,810 $ 1,596 The estimation of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves. Developments in the insurance industry have included consolidation activity between reinsurers, which has resulted in reinsurance risk across the industry being concentrated among fewer companies. In 2005, we increased our percentage of underwriting retention of new term life insurance policies by approximately 10 15% on average depending on product mix. Our reinsurance recoverables, summarized by reinsurer as of December 31, are shown in the following table.

We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended December 31, 2005. 81 We enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Allstate Financial Outlook Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. These strategies include continuing to proactively manage capital and focus our product portfolio on products where we can secure market leadership and achieve acceptable returns. We will continue to manage our expenses and improve our operating efficiency. We plan to reinvigorate sales through the Allstate exclusive agencies by further tailoring products for our customers and making it easier for our agents to distribute Allstate Financial products. We prioritize the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of products with the best sustainable growth and margins and to maintain a market presence for fixed annuity and life products in our retail distribution channels. Our institutional products remain opportunistic. INVESTMENTS An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure. Overview and Strategy The Property Liability portfolios investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has produced competitive returns over time, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. We employ a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk/return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest. The models recommended asset allocation, along with duration and liquidity considerations, guides our initial asset allocation. This is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets. Portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. The Allstate Financial portfolios investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital. We believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. We believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time. The portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary modeling, including a strategic asset allocation model, as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive, illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements. Within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. The Corporate and Other portfolios investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure. The portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns. 82 As a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios, we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. Portfolio reviews, which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery, are conducted regularly. For more information, see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. Portfolio Composition The composition of the investment portfolios at December 31, 2005 is presented in the table below. Also see Notes 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements for investment accounting policies and additional information.

Cost basis for these securities was $4.48 billion, $325 million, and $68 million for Property Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively. (3)Balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other. Total investments increased to $118.30 billion at December 31, 2005 from $115.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating activities including increased funds associated with securities lending, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases and decreased net unrealized gains on fixed income securities. The Property Liability investment portfolio decreased to $39.57 billion at December 31, 2005 from $40.27 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation and payments of catastrophe claims, partially offset by positive cash flows from other operating activities. The Allstate Financial investment portfolio increased to $75.23 billion at December 31, 2005, from $72.53 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to positive cash flows from operating, and financing activities, partially offset by decreased unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities. The Corporate and Other investment portfolio increased to $3.49 billion at December 31, 2005, from $2.73 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to additional investments made in the portfolio of Kennett Capital, Inc. ("Kennett Capital"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation, the original source of which was dividends from AIC, partially offset by the liquidation of an investment management variable interest entity ("VIE") with investments of $298 million. Total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending activities, funds received in connection with securities repurchase agreements, and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions, decreased to $4.10 billion at December 31, 2005, from $4.85 billion at December 31, 2004. 83 We use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. The following table shows total investments, categorized by the method used to determine fair value at December 31, 2005. Investments (in millions) Carrying Value Percent to total Derivative Contracts Fair Value Fair value based on independent market quotations $ 92,291 78.0 % $ 69 Fair value based on models and other valuation methods 13,708 11.6 976 Mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans and certain limited partnership and other investments, valued at cost, amortized cost and the equity method 12,298 10.4 Total $ 118,297 100.0 % $ 1,045 Fixed Income Securities See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost, unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income security for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $26.74 billion and 96.6% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Approximately 64.5% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by seven bond insurers and accordingly have a Moodys equivalent rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2005 consisted of approximately 3,500 issues from approximately 2,500 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was approximately 1% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate entities were the ultimate obligors of approximately 8.9% of the municipal bond portfolio. Corporate bonds totaled $40.13 billion and 90.2% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio contained $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations, 44.2% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $17.41 billion at December 31, 2004. Approximately $15.63 billion or 88.2% of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities. The benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates. A disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2005, 89.0% of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade. Foreign government securities totaled $2.95 billion and 95.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2005. Mortgage backed securities ("MBS") totaled $9.04 billion at December 31, 2005, all of which were investment grade. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. 84 Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities ("CMBS") totaled $6.99 billion at December 31, 2005. CMBS investments primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages, broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. The CMBS portfolio is subject to credit risk, but unlike other structured products, is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages, whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates. Credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments. Approximately 82.2% of the CMBS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors rating of AAA, the highest rating category, at December 31, 2005. Asset backed securities ("ABS") totaled $8.08 billion at December 31, 2005. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral. In addition, many of the securities in the ABS portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and or insurance. Approximately 65.1% of the ABS portfolio had a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poors ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. A portion of the ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since, for example, price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets. The ABS portfolio includes collateralized debt obligations and other bonds that are secured by a variety of asset types, predominately home equity loans, credit card receivables and auto loans. At December 31, 2005, 94.8% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moodys or a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, Fitch or Dominion; or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. The following table summarizes the credit quality of the fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2005.

The equity securities portfolio was $6.16 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $5.90 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase is attributable to positive cash flows from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.31 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $1.34 billion at December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized losses totaled $22 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $14 million at December 31, 2004. Unrealized Gains and Losses See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in 85 determining whether the securities are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at December 31, 2005 totaled $4.58 billion, a decrease of $1.81 billion since December 31, 2004. Gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector are provided in the table below. Gross unrealized At December 31, 2005 Amortized cost Fair value Gains Losses (in millions) Corporate: Consumer goods (cyclical and non cyclical) $ 6,541 $ 137 $ (71 ) $ 6,607 Public utilities 5,802 433 (27 ) 6,208 Banking 5,581 159 (39 ) 5,701 Financial services 5,247 78 (58 ) 5,267 Capital goods 3,872 103 (34 ) 3,941 Communications 3,080 100 (25 ) 3,155 Basic industry 2,343 63 (22 ) 2,384 Energy 2,237 71 (18 ) 2,290 Transportation 1,893 84 (22 ) 1,955 Other 1,820 85 (17 ) 1,888 Technology 724 21 (7 ) 738 Total corporate fixed income portfolio 39,140 1,334 (340 ) 40,134 U.S. government and agencies 3,151 880 (4 ) 4,027 Municipal 25,621 1,152 (33 ) 26,740 Foreign government 2,558 400 (4 ) 2,954 Mortgage backed securities 9,123 38 (122 ) 9,039 Commercial mortgage backed securities 7,004 52 (67 ) 6,989 Asset backed securities 8,087 40 (44 ) 8,083 Redeemable preferred stock 93 6 99 Total fixed income securities $ 94,777 $ 3,902 $ (614 ) $ 98,065 The consumer goods, financial services, banking, capital goods, public utilities, and communications sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2005. The gross unrealized losses in these sectors were primarily company specific and interest rate related. Approximately $33 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio were associated with the automobile industry, which includes direct debt issuances of automobile manufacturers, captive automotive financing companies and automobile parts and equipment suppliers, which are reported above in the consumer goods and financial services sectors. Fixed income security values in the automobile industry were primarily depressed due to company specific conditions. Additionally, approximately $5 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and $7 million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were depressed due to company or issue specific conditions and economic issues, including fuel costs. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 86 The following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2005.

Due to lags between the funding of an investment, execution of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC, and rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating. At December 31, 2005, $551 million, or 89.7%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired. As of December 31, 2005, $63 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 14.3% were in a significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2005. Included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired. We mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities, through diversification of the portfolio, and active credit monitoring and portfolio management. The scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of prepayments by the issuers.

At December 31, 2005, the consumer goods, communications and technology sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio, which were company and sector specific. We expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. Portfolio Monitoring We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate, on a case by case basis, fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list. As a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration and revisions to strategic asset allocations, and certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers, we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery. All securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005 were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary. 88  The following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance, aging and investment grade classification.

The largest individual unrealized loss was $4 million for category (i) and $5 million for category (ii) as of December 31, 2005. 89 Categories (i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate increases and the markets evaluation of certain sectors. The degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. Categories (iii) and (iv) have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions. All of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment. We expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time. Whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity securitys unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 12 months is temporary, additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, one security with an unrealized loss of $3 million met these criteria. The following table contains the individual securities with the largest unrealized losses as of December 31, 2005. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than $3 million or 0.5% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities.

Problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security. Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay future principal and interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future. 90 The following table summarizes problem, restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at December 31. 2005 2004 (in millions) Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Amortized cost Fair value Percent of total Fixed Income portfolio Problem $ 172 $ 188 0.2 % $ 150 $ 153 0.1 % Restructured 33 34 75 75 0.1 Potential problem 178 191 0.2 265 269 0.3 Total net carrying value $ 383 $ 413 0.4 % $ 490 $ 497 0.5 % Cumulative write downs recognized $ 304 $ 351 We have experienced an increase in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily related to the addition of securities to the problem category as a result of company specific issues, including the bankruptcy filings of certain airlines. The decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as restructured and potential problem as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was primarily related to dispositions. We evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2005 and recorded write downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio. Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Investment write downs $ (55 ) $ (129 ) $ (294 ) Dispositions 619 828 453 Valuation of derivative instruments (95 ) (46 ) 16 Settlement of derivative instruments 80 (62 ) 21 Realized capital gains and losses, pretax 549 591 196 Income tax expense (189 ) (199 ) (62 ) Realized capital gains and losses, after tax $ 360 $ 392 $ 134 Dispositions in the above table include sales, losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions and other transactions such as calls and prepayments. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities. In certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent credit deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security. Included in investment write downs were $11 million of realized losses related to airline industry holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dispositions included net realized gains on sales of 91 $827 million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of $208 million. The net realized gains were comprised of gross gains of $1.17 billion and gross losses of $341 million. The $341 million in gross losses primarily consisted of $192 million from sales of fixed income securities and $142 million from sales of equity securities. A changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level. A duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view. Tactical duration adjustments within managements approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses and through new purchases. As a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration, realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. This approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation. Because of the level of catastrophe losses experienced during 2005 and the possibility that we may need to have additional cash available to pay claims, we identified a portfolio from which we would consider selecting specific securities to sell to meet these needs. Certain of these securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $34 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in this portfolio was $13.13 billion. Because of an anticipated rise in interest rates, as well as changes in existing market conditions and long term asset return assumptions, certain changes are planned within various portfolios. These included continued asset liability management strategies, on going comprehensive reviews of our portfolios, and changes being made to our strategic asset allocations, including Property Liability duration. In addition, we decided to pursue yield enhancement strategies for the Allstate Financial portfolio. Certain of the securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position, for which we recognized $174 million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities in these portfolios was $1.24 billion. Gains from dispositions during 2004 include $90 million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and $49 million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the Allstate Floridian Insurance Company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims. The ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $45 million with the largest being $9 million and the smallest being $3 million. None of the $45 million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale. Our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates. No other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on dispositions and 92 writedowns greater than 0.8% of the total gross loss on dispositions and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities.

(2)Holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost. (3)Losses due to a decision to decrease our exposure to two large domestic auto manufacturers and as a result of changing economic circumstances, including the decline in their overall market share. The circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios. Mortgage Loans Our mortgage loan portfolio which is primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio was $8.75 billion at December 31, 2005 and $7.86 billion at December 31, 2004, and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk. We closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had no net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2005 and had $1 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short Term Investments Our short term investment portfolio was $3.47 billion and $4.13 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year. We also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expense. At December 31, 2005, the amount of securities lending collateral 93 reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of $650 million. This compares to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2004. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: 1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. Overview We generate substantial investible funds from our Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business. Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight and investment activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees. For Allstate Financial, its asset liability management ("ALM") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks. ALM focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate investment risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies specify limits, ranges and or targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financials business objectives in light of its product liabilities. We manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation, duration and value at risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the Property Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income, equity, and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the ALM organization. This integration results in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return, conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of 94 Allstate Financials product liabilities and supported by the application of advanced risk technology and analytics. Although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the Property Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest rate sensitive assets and issue interest rate sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations. We manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2005, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.50, compared to a 0.84 gap at December 31, 2004. A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. Most of our duration gap originates from the Property Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the Property Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property Liability assets and liabilities. For the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy may include using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers. We pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling $33 million as of December 31, 2005. For over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2005, we held $352 million of cash pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments and did not have any collateral pledged to counterparties. To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions 95 (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds, callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.45 billion, compared to $1.79 billion at December 31, 2004. There are $7.04 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments. These assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate. The $7.04 billion of assets excluded from the calculation has decreased from the $7.32 billion reported at December 31, 2004 due to a decrease in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $456 million, compared to a decrease of $427 million at December 31, 2004. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property Liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2005, we would recognize realized capital gains totaling $27 million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $27 million in realized capital losses in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. To the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates. Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. At December 31, 2005, we held approximately $4.97 billion in common stocks and $2.03 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible securities, limited partnership funds, non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes), compared to approximately $4.88 billion in common stocks and $1.82 billion in other equity investments at December 31, 2004. Approximately 100.0% and 66.3% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of the Property Liability operations at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 99.8% and 65.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately 0.95, compared to a beta of approximately 0.85 at December 31, 2004. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investments market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 9.5%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500 increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 9.5%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2005, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately 96 $667 million, compared to $569 million at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three year historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $15.24 billion and $14.38 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $25 million and $24 million less in fee income at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Variable annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial have a GMDB and customers may have chosen to purchase an enhanced GMDB, a GMIB from 1998 to December 31, 2003, a TrueReturnSM guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("GMAB") beginning in 2004, and a SureIncomeSM guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") beginning in 2005. These guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value. GMDBs are payable upon death. GMIBs may be exercised on or after the tenth year anniversary (not prior to 2008) of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue (not prior to 2012). GMABs guarantee an account value of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract, depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements. GMWBs may be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals. GMWBs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to 8% of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit. In January 2004, we established reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs in conjunction with the adoption of SOP 03 1. Because of this change in accounting, guarantee payments are now recognized over future periods rather than expensed as paid. For more details about this adopted accounting guidance and the calculation of the related reserves see Notes 2 and 8 of the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $1.52 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2005 and customer surrenders of contracts with in the money GMDBs. In both periods, approximately half of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining half is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in 2003 to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after January 1, 2003. A similar program was established for GMABs in 2004 and for GMWBs in 2005. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at December 31, 2005 would increase by an estimated $15 million in 2006. These payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to 97 earnings as paid. Contributions to the reserve for GMDBs would increase by a nominal amount in 2006 in the event of an immediate 10% decline in account values. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model. GMIB contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variable annuity products beginning in 1998, with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue. Accordingly, the earliest date at which benefits could become payable is 2008. Therefore, in the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005 due to equity market declines, contributions to the reserve would be increased by approximately $1 million in 2006. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in GMAB and GMWB contractholders account values as of December 31, 2005, due to equity market declines, there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are hedged, however the reserve for GMABs and GMWBs would be increased by approximately $10 million and $2 million, respectively. In addition to our GMDB, GMIB and GMAB equity risk, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 we had approximately $2.72 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively, in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits. Allstate Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable annuity and life contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including real estate funds and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $1.17 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively, in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $538 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $566 million net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts were $455 million and $567 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property Liability business. Based upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $110 million, compared with an estimated $102 million decrease at December 31, 2004. The selection of a 98 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 34 countries, compared to 32 countries at December 31, 2004. Our largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2005 were to the Canadian dollar (52.4%) and the Euro (14.7%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2004 were to the Canadian dollar (56.5%) and the British pound (11.0%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.2% at December 31, 2005, compared to 28.7% at December 31, 2004. The modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee. PENSION PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents. See Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. As provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period, which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Net periodic pension cost in 2006 is estimated to be $331 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2005 and 2004 principally due to decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates, the impact of unfavorable investment returns from prior periods on the market related value of assets, and the amortization of actuarial losses. In each of the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents. Settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. Amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $135 million in 2005 and $121 million in 2004. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. Amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poors or at least "Aa" by Moodys on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities. 99  Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $58 million in net periodic pension cost and an $1.08 billion increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2005, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of $50 million in net periodic pension cost and a $867 million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $45 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by $6 million as of October 31, 2005, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $41 million and a $49 million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of October 31, 2004. This non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses. We made contributions during 2005 sufficient to eliminate a minimum pension liability for one of our qualified pension plans. The minimum pension liability reported at December 31, 2005 relates solely to our unfunded non qualified pension plans. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur. Holding other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $38 million in pension cost at October 31, 2005, compared to an increase of $37 million at October 31, 2004. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $38 million at October 31, 2005, compared to a decrease of $37 million at October 31, 2004. Changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital Resources consist of shareholders equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources at December 31. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Common stock, retained earnings and other shareholders equity items $ 18,104 $ 19,208 $ 17,809 Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,082 2,615 2,756 Total shareholders equity 20,186 21,823 20,565 Debt 5,300 5,334 5,076 Total capital resources $ 25,486 $ 27,157 $ 25,641 Ratio of debt to shareholders equity 26.3 % 24.4 % 24.7 % Ratio of debt to capital resources 20.8 % 19.6 % 19.8 % 100 Shareholders equity declined in 2005, due to net income being offset by share repurchases, decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders. Shareholders equity increased in 2004 when compared to 2003, as net income was partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. In January 2005, we commenced a $4.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2005, this program had $1.55 billion remaining and is expected to be completed in 2006. Treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity and, since 1995, we have acquired 337 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $12.39 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 84 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Debt decreased in 2005 primarily due to decreases in long term debt partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. In May 2005, we issued $800 million of 5.55% Senior Notes due 2035, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes including to fund the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005, which were repaid at their scheduled maturity, May 1, 2005. In July 2005, we liquidated our consolidated investment management VIE. As a result of the liquidation, long term debt decreased by $279 million. We plan to use existing sources of liquidity to fund the repayment of our $550 million 5.375% senior notes due in 2006. Debt increased in 2004 primarily due to increases in long term borrowings outstanding. We issued $650 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2014, utilizing the registration statement filed with the SEC in June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the $900 million of 77/8% Senior Notes due 2005 at their scheduled maturity on May 1, 2005. The increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of $412 million related to the deconsolidation of a VIE resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the VIE. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $413 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.22%. Financial Ratings and Strength The following table summarizes our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at December 31, 2005. Moodys Standard & Poors A.M. Best The Allstate Corporation (senior long term debt) A1 A+ a The Allstate Corporation (commercial paper) P 1 A 1 AMB 1 Allstate Insurance Company (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (insurance financial strength) Aa2 AA A+ Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. We have distinct groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida. These groups maintain separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other Allstate subsidiaries that are not part of these respective groups. The ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate distinctly to each group. 101 Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a financial strength rating no lower than B+. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company and Encompass Insurance Company of New Jersey, which write auto and homeowners insurance, are rated A by A.M. Best. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company also has a Demotech rating of A". Allstate Floridian, which writes primarily property insurance, has an A.M. Best rating of B+ with a negative outlook, and remains under review currently. The resolution of this review will be influenced by developments prior to the 2006 hurricane season, including Florida regulatory and legislative actions, Allstate and Allstate Floridian management actions, A.M. Bests assessment of the timing and nature of such developments and their view on the amount of capital and risk adjusted capitalization deemed necessary to support the ratings. Allstate Floridian Insurance Company and its subsidiary, Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company, also have a Demotech rating of A. Encompass Floridian Insurance Company and Encompass Floridian Indemnity Company, both subsidiaries of Allstate Floridian, have Demotech ratings of A. In addition, AIC committed to AFIC to make as much as $375 million of additional capital available until May 31, 2006 under specified circumstances if one or more events reduce AFICs capital to below $272 million initially and to $225 million if subsequent events should occur. In December 2005, $159 million was contributed under this agreement. As of December 31, 2005, AFICs statutory surplus is approximately $233 million compared to $272 million at December 31, 2004. For Allstate Floridian, premiums written during 2005 totaled $426 million and property PIF, excluding the policies that have already been ceded to Universal, was approximately 560,000 as of December 31, 2005. The extent of Allstate Floridians management actions are expected to reduce premiums, PIF and the related amount of catastrophe exposure to a level more commensurate with Allstate Floridians surplus, which has declined in recent years due to losses incurred related to hurricanes, and consistent with its capacity to achieve an acceptable rating from A.M. Best. For examples of such actions taken in 2005 and early 2006 see the Hurricane section of the MD&A. Allstates domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings. As of December 31, 2005, AICs statutory surplus is approximately $14.8 billion compared to $16.9 billion at December 31, 2004. This decline is primarily due to the estimated catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the payment of $3.86 billion of dividends by AIC in 2005. During 2005, The Allstate Corporation committed to contribute capital to AIC. For more details about this commitment, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. The ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a companys premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AICs premium to surplus ratio was 1.8x on December 31, 2005 compared to 1.5x in the prior year. State laws specify regulatory actions if an insurers risk based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurers solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2005, the RBC for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions. 102 The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges.

Claim payments increased as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Higher operating cash flows of the Property Liability business in 2004 were primarily due to increased underwriting income despite catastrophe losses in 2004 and contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans in 2004. Cash provided by investing activities increased in 2005 primarily as a result of increased proceeds from sales of securities, partially offset by lower operating cash flows and higher dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily as a result of less underwriting income being available for investment due to higher operating cash flows offset by dividends paid by AIC to its parent. Cash provided by financing activities was the result of borrowing under our commercial paper program. Cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation, totaling $3.86 billion, $2.49 billion and $1.27 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on this limitation, without the prior approval from the Illinois Department of Insurance, AIC will not pay dividends to the Allstate Corporation until the third quarter of 2006. We expect that AIC will have sufficient liquidity to pay estimated catastrophe claims and claims expenses from existing sources of funds including operating cash flows, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and maturities and sales of investments. We expect the loss reserves from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma to be paid during 2006. Allstate Financial Higher operating cash flows for Allstate Financial in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily related to higher investment income, partially offset by lower life and annuity premiums. Lower cash flows from operating activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid, partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2005 due to lower cash provided by financing in 2005, compared to 2004, increased proceeds from sales of securities and higher investment collections, partially offset by the investment of higher operating cash flows. Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as the investment of higher financing cash flows was partially offset by lower operating cash flow. 104 Lower cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005, compared to 2004, were primarily due to higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities, lower deposits on fixed annuities and institutional products, and increased maturities of institutional products. Increased cash flows from financing activities in 2004, compared to 2003, were primarily attributable to higher deposits of fixed annuities and institutional products, partially offset by fixed annuity withdrawals and institutional product maturities. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financials liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2005. Approximately 15.8% of these liabilities are subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment. (in millions) 2005 Not subject to discretionary withdrawal $ 16,546 Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments: Specified surrender charges(1) 24,301 Market value(2) 9,729 Subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments 9,464 Total Contractholder funds $ 60,040 (1)Includes $8.20 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5.0% of the account balance. (2)Approximately $8.61 billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30 45 day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment, including approximately $1.60 billion of market value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during 2006. To ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios. Depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions, the Allstate Financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods. Corporate and Other Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows, were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements. Investing activities primarily relate to activity in the portfolio of Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt, repayment of debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities. We have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines of credit, dollar rolls and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2005, these sources could provide over $3.48 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can also issue new insurance contracts, incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $17.72 billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent 15.0% of the consolidated investment portfolio, and $8.75 billion of mortgage loans that represent 7.4% of the consolidated investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios. The sources of liquidity for 105 The Allstate Corporation include but are not limited to dividends from AIC and $2.34 billion of investments at Kennett Capital. We have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows: A commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining borrowing capacity was $587 million; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily. A five year revolving credit facility expiring in 2009 totaling $1.00 billion to cover short term liquidity requirements. This facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500 million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior, unsecured, nonguaranteed long term debt. There were no borrowings under this line of credit during 2005. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. The capacity to issue up to an additional $1.35 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003. Our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease VIE obligations. The covenant requires that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements. This ratio at December 31, 2005 was 21.5%. For quantification of the synthetic lease VIE obligations, see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. We closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation, the business segments and investments. Allstate Financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its ALM organization, using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio, and components of the portfolio as appropriate, which is routinely subjected to stress testing. Allstate Protections underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity, which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses. Property Liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities, including short term investments, exchange traded common stock, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows. Discontinued Lines and Coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk. Allstate Financial and Property Liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program. Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our long term debt rating of A1, A+ and a (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to non investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB /bb, a downgrade in AICs financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A , or a downgrade in ALICs financial strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moodys, Standard & Poors and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA /A . The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities, therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 106  Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements(1) $ 4,102 $ 4,102 $ $ $ Commercial paper 413 413 Contractholder funds(2) 72,881 8,669 21,715 12,699 29,798 Reserve for life contingent contract benefits(3) 28,739 1,210 3,326 2,229 21,974 Long term debt(4) 8,790 927 534 1,180 6,149 Capital lease obligations(4) 97 12 24 24 37 Operating leases(4) 822 213 301 168 140 Unconditional purchase obligations(4) 533 225 179 98 31 Pension obligations(4)(5) 153 129 24 Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense(6) 22,117 10,368 6,288 2,317 3,144 Other liabilities and accrued expenses(7)(8) 9,941 4,113 223 159 5,446 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 148,588 $ 30,381 $ 32,614 $ 18,874 $ 66,719 (1)Liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash or marketable securities. We manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. (2)Contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life, fixed annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies, bank deposits and institutional products. These amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to (i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts and bank deposits, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $72.88 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $60.04 billion included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for contractholder funds. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (3)The reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders. Immediate annuities with life contingencies include (i) contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract. Other contracts, such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts, the Company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or illness, or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event, such as a surrender of a policy or contract, which is outside of the control of the Company. We have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $28.74 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $12.48 billion included 107 in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 for reserve for life contingent contract benefits. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above. (4)Our payment obligations relating to long term debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program. Amount differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 because the long term debt amount above includes interest. (5)Pension obligations represent planned contributions to our pension plans. (6)Reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported. The reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2005, of $2.20 billion and $252 million, respectively. (7)Other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $9.94 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $4.91 billion. (8)Balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $10.96 billion and deferred income taxes of $351 million. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting. In addition, other liabilities of $172 million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain. Our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005 and the payments due by period are shown in the following table. (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years Other Commitments Conditional(1) $ 618 $ 552 $ 66 $ $ Other Commitments Unconditional(1) 1,176 41 653 455 27 Total Commitments $ 1,794 $ 593 $ 719 $ 455 $ 27 (1)Represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans. We have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required. For a more detailed discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken. In addition, we have a senior management advisory committee called the Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC"). Although the work of the ERC is still evolving, it is responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within Allstate. In the vision of the ERC, enterprise risk management ("ERM") is a disciplined, holistic, and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which: Provides additional factors when setting strategy across Allstate 108 Identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on Allstate Manages risk consistent with Allstates risk appetite Provides greater assurance of achieving Allstates objectives Allows Allstate to achieve a return commensurate with the risks taken Effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate policies, tolerances and limits; consistent ERM practices which include risk identification, evaluation, prioritization, treatment and monitoring; and effective communication and reporting. Managers in the various business units are responsible for managing, measuring, and evaluating risks as appropriate in their respective areas and that are within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise. This would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe; managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk, duration and convexity metrics; and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement. As appropriate, consistent enterprise wide measurement standards are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning and capital management. For Allstate Protection, we are utilizing an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed, given a defined tolerance for risk. Economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk/reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our business. Future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the Allstate Financial business unit and at a consolidated level so that there is a total enterprise capability. REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS As of December 31, 2005, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS This document contains "forward looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 109 These forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC. In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services. Risks Relating to the Property Liability business As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms and terrorism. We may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our homeowners insurance business in amounts in excess of those experienced this year, in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis, and in excess of those that modelers estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits. While we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion, and the Northridge earthquake of 1994 totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the CEA, and various state created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings. In addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted Although, along with others in the industry, we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our personal lines homeowners exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios, such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management 110 activities, there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period. Examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability, and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable. In addition, the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state specific policy language, demand surge and loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses, which are subject to wide variation by storm. Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth We believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers, will be successful over the long term, however it is possible that they will have a negative impact on near term growth and earnings. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention will be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to reduced cross selling opportunities, new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected. Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by hurricanes. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of Texas during 2002. Although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity. Our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. Other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims Recorded claim reserves in the Property Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and IBNR, after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends 111 involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, and contractual terms. External factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Management believes the estimated claim reserves related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma are appropriately established and recorded based on available facts, information, laws and regulations. However, actual results may differ materially from the amounts recorded for a variety of reasons: our policyholders ability to report and our ability to adjust claims were impeded by the extent of the devastation, the size of the area affected, and the fact that some communities were hit by more than one storm; it is particularly difficult to assess the extent of damage in the initial stages of adjusting residential property losses; our estimate for the ultimate costs of repairs may not prove to be correct because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by a hurricane; the number of IBNR claims may be greater or less than anticipated; the need to have more claims adjusters to handle the large number of claims has increased pressure on our catastrophe claims settlement management process; and litigation has been filed, which if ultimately decided against us, could lead to a material increase in our catastrophe claims and claims expense estimate. Losses from catastrophes on policies Allstate sells and administers as a participant in the NFIP program are reported in our reserves for claims and claims expense and in our reinsurance recoverable. Since the level of NFIP claim activity that we experienced in 2005 is unprecedented, in subsequent fiscal quarters we may need to increase the amount of IBNR and related reinsurance recoverable. However, because the federal government is responsible for paying all such claims, we do not expect that any such increases will affect net income or shareholders equity. Additionally, the expense allowances we receive from NFIP may ultimately be determined to be either insufficient to meet our incremental expense or may prove to be in excess of such expense. Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position. Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, when 112 Allstate Protections loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases, impose rate rollbacks or require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurers ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurers ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. We are subject to assessments from state insurance facilities We are currently monitoring developments with respect to various state facilities such as guaranty funds, LA Citizens, FL Citizens, the Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association, the Mississippi Residential Underwriting Association, the Alabama Insurance Underwriting Association, the Texas FAIR Plan Association and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. The ultimate impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma on these facilities is currently uncertain, but could result in the facilities recognizing a financial deficit or a financial deficit greater than the level currently estimated. They may, in turn, have the ability to assess participating insurers when financial deficits occur, adversely affecting our results of operations. These facilities are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders. Allstate and other insurance companies writing residential property policies in Florida, including FL Citizens, must participate in the FHCF, which potentially reimburses companies for their qualifying losses at various participating percentages above required retention levels subject to maximum reimbursement amounts. Allstate and these other companies currently have reimbursement recoverable balances from the FHCF for the 2004 and 2005 hurricane losses in Florida. If the FHCF does not have sufficient funds to pay its ultimate reimbursement obligations, it has the authority to issue bonds. Such bonds are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers compensation, medical malpractice and accident and health insurance. By law, these assessments are the obligation of insurance policyholders which insurance companies must collect. Companies are required to collect the FHCF assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to the FHCF as they are collected. The exposure to assessments and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases from these facilities may not offset each other in the Companys financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years. 113 The potential benefits of implementing Tiered Pricing may not be fully realized We believe that Tiered Pricing and underwriting (including SRM which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, we may lose our competitive advantage. Further, the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our Tiered Pricing model. Furthermore, because we have been using Tiered Pricing only for the last several years, we can not be assured that Tiered Pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our expectation that the amount of business written using Tiered Pricing will increase may not be realized. Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability Our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts, satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability. Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability Reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 114 Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread based products, such as fixed annuities and institutional products, is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid or been sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products. Non parallel shifts in interest rates, such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates, can influence customer demand for fixed annuities, which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segments fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. For certain products, principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products, the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields. We may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates, which could narrow spreads. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability. Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition Conditions in the domestic and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of Allstate Financials variable annuities. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB, GMAB and GMWB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves, which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or Allstate Financials net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount. Changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC DAC related to interest sensitive life, fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to AGP and EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts. Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 115 A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance and annuities, receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning. Actions taken to simplify our business model and improve profitability may not be successful and may result in losses and costs Allstate Financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity. Actions that we have taken and may continue to take include changing the number and selection of products being marketed, terminating underperforming distribution relationships, merging or disposing of unnecessary and or non strategic legal entities, reducing policy administration software systems, and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies. The actions that we have taken and may take in the future may not achieve their intended outcome and could result in lower premiums and contract charges, restructuring costs, losses on disposition or losses related to the discontinuance of individual products or distribution relationships. Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because many of our products include a savings or investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. 116 We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality We are subject to market risk, the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and, to a lesser degree, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For additional information on market risk, see the "Market Risk" section of MD&A. A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolios average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also cause the purchase of longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower. A declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified. We may suffer losses from litigation As is typical for a large company, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation, including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In some circumstances, we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we pay in judgments, settlements and litigation expenses. However, we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability, if any, or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation. Consequently, the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and, therefore, may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters. 117 We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth As insurance companies, broker dealers, investment advisers and or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation. Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives. Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 118 The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Additionally, in the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial could be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurers statutory capital; a change in a rating agencys determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurers investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurers control. The insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are A+, AA and Aa2 from A.M. Best, Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively. Several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies. Because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. As a result of the capital support agreement with AIC, in certain circumstances it could be compelled in 2006 to make a capital contribution that would be completed out of The Allstate Corporations available sources of liquidity. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the 119 payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our debt and complete repurchase programs in the timeframe expected. The occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems. In the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.  Item 7A.
