Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled item1A Risk Factors. Overview We are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states including hematologic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders. Since our incorporation in January 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery, research, and product and clinical development. Additionally, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc., or AAT, we are engaged in the discovery and development of a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs. In September 2005, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Alexion Europe SAS, as an important step in our strategy to manage late stage development, regulatory and commercial operations throughout Europe. Our lead clinical product candidate, Soliris (eculizumab), is currently undergoing evaluation in a Phase III clinical development program comprised of two Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of a rare blood disorder known as Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PNH. Under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA process, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has agreed to the design of protocols for these two trials, known as TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD, which could, if successful, serve as the primary basis of review for approval of a licensing application for eculizumab in the PNH indication. TRIUMPH is a placebo controlled efficacy trial and SHEPERD is an open label, non placebo controlled safety trial with efficacy secondary endpoints. In January 2006, we reported positive results from TRIUMPH. All pre specified, primary and secondary endpoints in the TRIUMPH trial were achieved with statistical significance. SHEPHERD is a twelve month study with a six month preplanned interim analysis. SHEPHERD completed enrollment in September, 2005. It is expected that data from TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD will serve as the primary basis of review for the approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the PNH indication, as well as the basis of review for a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA. Our second clinical stage product candidate, pexelizumab, is currently under evaluation in two separate indications: (1) coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and (2) acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous angioplasty. In November 2005, we announced that our Phase III trial of pexelizumab in CABG surgery patients, known as PRIMO CABG2, did not to achieve its primary endpoint. Results from the PRIMO CABG2 trial of pexelizumab indicate that the trial is unlikely to be sufficient for filing for licensing approval of pexelizumab in the CABG indication. On February 3, 2006, we announced that our Phase III trial of pexelizumab in AMI patients, known as APEX AMI, will be completed prior to enrolling the originally anticipated number of patients. That announcement stated that enrollment would be capped at approximately 5,000 patients, ending near the beginning of March. We since have been encouraged by leading academic researchers involved in the trial to allow enrollment to proceed beyond those numbers, primarily to allow the trial to have a greater chance of success in achieving its primary endpoint of mortality benefit. Along with our partner, Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals or P&G, we recently agreed to support continued enrollment in APEX AMI for a limited period of time. We expect to update the anticipated timing of completion of APEX AMI after further discussion with 49 P&G, and after new definitive determinations have been made. Although the APEX AMI trial is the subject of an SPA, the number of patients actually enrolled may not be sufficient for the FDA to consider the trial compliant with the SPA agreement. In such event, if results of the APEX AMI trial are successful, we may still seek approval to market pexelizumab in the AMI indication, but the FDA regulatory process may not be subject to any benefits of the SPA process. The pexelizumab trials are conducted in collaboration with Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals. Currently, none of our drug product candidates is available for commercial sale. All of our potential products are in clinical or pre clinical development and the status of each of our lead product candidates is set forth, by indication, in Item 1 of this Report under the heading Product Development Programs. Successful completion of development of a product candidate is contingent on numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors which are described in detail in the section entitled Risk Factors. These factors include: completion of pre clinical and clinical trials of the product candidate with scientific results that support further development and or regulatory approval receipt of necessary regulatory approvals obtaining adequate supplies of product candidates on commercially reasonable terms obtaining capital necessary to fund our operations, including our research and development efforts, manufacturing requirements and clinical trials performance of third party collaborators, particularly Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, on whom we rely heavily for the co development and commercialization of one of our lead product candidates performance of third party manufacturers, particularly Lonza Biologics, on whom we rely heavily for the manufacture of one of our lead product candidates obtaining manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities for which we presently have limited resources. As a result of the amount and nature of these factors, many of which are outside of our control, the success, timing of completion, and ultimate cost, of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty. The timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by, among other things, slow patient enrollment; long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness; lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate; disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites; adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials; lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested; and lack of sufficient funds. 50 If we do not successfully complete clinical trials, we will not receive regulatory approval to market our drug products. If we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, we will not generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed. To date, we have not received any revenues from the sale of products. We have incurred operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $506 million. We expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development, pre clinical studies and clinical testing, regulatory activities, manufacturing development, scale up and commercial scale manufacturing, pre commercialization activities, developing a sales and marketing force, and increasing administrative personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations, and we may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs. We plan to develop and commercialize Soliris (eculizumab) ourselves along with those product candidates for which the clinical trials and commercialization requirements can be funded and accomplished by our own resources. For those products which require greater resources, such as pexelizumab, our plan is to develop and commercialize the drugs through corporate partnerships. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. We do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing, development, or sale of our drug candidates. In January 2005 we sold $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If the holder elects to convert its 1.375% Notes upon the occurrence of a designated event, the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date. These additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option, are set according to a table within the offering document, and are capped (in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed 42.9100 per $1,000 principal amount). Change in Accounting Principle Prior to our change in fiscal year, we would test goodwill for impairment annually in March and whenever events or changes in circumstances would indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable. This is more fully described in Goodwill under our significant accounting policies. In connection with the change in fiscal year to December 31, we changed the timing of our annual impairment test. For the five month period ended December 31, 2005, our impairment test was performed in November 2005. We will continue to perform our impairment test in November going forward. We believe the change from an annual impairment test in our third quarter (March) under our previous fiscal year to our fourth quarter (November) in our new fiscal year, supports consistency in the application of this accounting principle. This change had no effect on net income or earnings per share. 51 Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates In our preparation of consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Our estimates are often based on judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our result of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Marketable Securities We invest in marketable debt securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity. We believe that our conservative investment policy ensures reasonable assurance against impairment of marketable securities held, and also enables us to avoid incurring realized losses that could occur if securities were not held to maturity. Long Lived Assets We assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important, and which could trigger an impairment review, include, among others, the following: a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset; and a significant decrease in market value of assets. If we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable, based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, such amount is recognized as an impairment charge. Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets, and is not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable. No impairment charge resulted upon the adoption of this standard or as a result of our annual impairment assessment. The first step of the annual review is to compare the fair market capitalization of Alexion on that date to our net stockholders equity. If fair market capitalization is greater than net stockholders equity, then no impairment charges are necessary. The analysis is impacted by the price of the stock on the date of the test. Impairment charges, if any, will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined. Prepaid Manufacturing Costs Cash advances paid by us to secure future long term manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs. These costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method. The cash advances are subject to refund if the manufacturing facility is unavailable as scheduled or forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production. 52 We evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value, or NRV. If estimated NRV were to be negative, all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense. Our calculation of NRV involves estimates of expected sales volume, sales price and market penetration of the product in question. Revenue Recognition We record contract research revenues from research and development support payments, license fees and milestone payments under collaborations with third parties, and amounts received from various government grants. We evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting. Deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. Up front, non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved, provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period. Research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities. Deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, pre clinical, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, manufacturing development and scale up costs, contract services and other outside contractor costs, research license fees, depreciation and amortization of lab facilities, and lab supplies. Theses costs are expensed when incurred. We have entered into a collaboration research agreement with P&G in which we share costs. We record these costs as research and development expenses as incurred. A portion of these costs are reimbursed by our collaborator and are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense. Accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work performed on our behalf. At the end of each period, we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Stock Based Compensation We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), effective August 1, 2005. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net earnings. We have elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, shall be recognized in the periods after the date of adoption. Due to our net loss position, a windfall tax benefit was not realized during the period. As of December 31, 2005, there was $25,488 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years. 53 Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. Also, of significance, is our expected term until exercise. We currently use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. Once employee stock option values are determined, they may not be changed. We continually seek to refine and improve our approach to measure the value of employee stock options. Foreign Currency Translation For our foreign subsidiary with a functional currency different from U.S. dollars, we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities the average exchange rate prevailing during each period for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rate for our investments in our foreign subsidiary. Adjustments from translating these financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Results of Operations On December 9, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31. The five months results now being reported by us relate to the transition period ended December 31, 2005. 54 The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this transition report. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Five Month Period Ended December 31, Year Ended July 31, 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 (Unaudited) Contract research revenues: P&G $ 245 $ 245 $ 588 $ 4,588 $ 673 U.S. government grants 419 476 21 204 Total revenues 664 245 1,064 4,609 877 Research and development expenses: Clinical development 21,966 12,810 43,314 20,398 25,122 Manufacturing and manufacturing development 10,714 8,119 20,835 14,027 17,414 Product development 32,680 20,929 64,149 34,425 42,536 Payroll and benefits 10,481 6,662 17,397 14,749 13,613 Discovery research 1,620 1,479 2,431 3,592 8,241 Operating, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization 3,457 2,844 7,411 7,074 6,652 Total research and development expenses 48,238 31,914 91,388 59,840 71,042 General and administrative 12,763 6,160 18,951 14,459 10,869 Impairment of fixed assets 760 2,560 Total operating expenses 61,001 38,074 110,339 75,059 84,471 Operating loss (60,337 ) (37,829 ) (109,275 ) (70,450 ) (83,594 ) Other income (expense): Investment income 3,123 1,756 5,266 3,373 5,809 Interest expense (1,192 ) (3,153 ) (6,125 ) (7,709 ) (7,694 ) Gain from extinguishment of note payable 3,804 3,804 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (3,185 ) Total other income (expense) 1,931 2,407 (240 ) (4,336 ) (1,885 ) State tax benefit 450 61 765 691 1,012 Net loss $ (57,956 ) $ (35,361 ) $ (108,750 ) $ (74,095 ) $ (84,467 ) Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (1.90 ) $ (1.28 ) $ (3.90 ) $ (3.43 ) $ (4.64 ) Comparison of the Five Months Ended December 31, 2005 to the Five Months Ended December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned contract research revenues of $664 and $245 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the revenue earned for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, $245 is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from a $10,000 upfront fee paid to us by P&G in 55 February 1999. Revenue from U.S. government grants totaled $419 and $0 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in revenues associated with U.S. government grants obtained in the transition period ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from research under the anti anthrax bio defense program. During the five months ended December 31, 2005, we incurred research and development expenses of $48,238 compared to the five months ended December 31, 2004 where we incurred research and development expenses of $31,914. We report our research and development costs by the category in which they are incurred rather than by project. Our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, product development costs, discovery research costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and occupancy related facility operating costs. Product development costs consist of pre clinical costs, clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs, manufacturing development and manufacturing costs. The $16,324 increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from greater product development costs of $11,751 from higher clinical development and higher manufacturing expenses costs related to the current Phase III clinical trials of our lead drug candidates, Soliris (eculizumab) and pexelizumab, for TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD, and the PNH extension trials and PRIMO CABG2 and APEX AMI trials, respectively. Payroll and benefits costs were impacted by the adoption of SFAS 123R and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants as well as increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities. Our collaboration with P&G resulted in pexelizumab related product development costs, excluding payroll related costs, of $17,805 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $11,121 for the five months ended December 31, 2004. This represented 54% and 53%, respectively, of our product development costs. The remaining balance of our product development costs was primarily for Soliris and other pre clinical product candidates. We expect that expenses for research and development will remain at a significant level in 2006 as critical and substantive clinical trials near their completion and as we may initiate development of other promising candidates. Our general and administrative expenses were $12,763 for the period, compared with $6,160 for the same period last year. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $6,603 from 2004 to 2005 was principally from expensing of employee stock options, increased headcount dedicated to commercial development activities and higher professional fees principally for patent and compliance activities. The impact on payroll and benefits expenses from the adoption of SFAS 123R was material, but the overall increase in expenses was predominantly driven by our ongoing development of a commercial organization that will ultimately support sales and marketing of product candidates, if approved by regulatory agencies. We believe general and administrative costs will increase in fiscal 2006 as we continue to put in place the commercial organization and infrastructure required to bring Soliris to market. Total operating expenses were $61,001 and $38,074 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment income was $3,123 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,756 for the same period in 2004, reflecting higher market interest rates and a higher principal balance. The higher principal balance is a result of the August 2005 issuance of 2,500,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at 56 $26.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds from the sale of $64,530, as well as an increase in convertible debt due to the sale of $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes (1.375% Notes) in January 2005, which was partially offset by the redemption of our $120,000 principal amount of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes (5.75% Notes) in March 2005. Interest expense decreased to $1,192 from $3,153, impacted by the lower coupon rate of the 1.375% Notes. A state tax benefit of $450 and $61 was recognized for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our December 31, 2005 and 2004 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $57,956 and $35,361 or $1.90 and $1.28 basic and diluted net loss per share for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned contract research revenues of $1,064 and $4,609 for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $4,000 milestone payment from P&G concurrent with the dosing of our first patient in the APEX AMI trial. Substantially all of the other revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from the $10,000 upfront fee paid to us by P&G in February 1999. Revenue from U.S. government grants totaled $476 in fiscal 2005 and $21 in fiscal 2004. The $455 increase in revenues associated with U.S. government grants obtained in fiscal 2005 resulted from research under the anti anthrax bio defense program. During fiscal year 2005, we incurred research and development expenses of $91,388 compared to fiscal year 2004 when we incurred research and development expenses of $59,840. We report research and development costs by category incurred rather than by project. Our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, pre clinical costs, clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs, manufacturing development and manufacturing costs, discovery research costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and occupancy related facility operating costs. The $31,548 increase in research and development expenses from 2004 to 2005 resulted primarily from greater product development costs of $29,724 from higher clinical development and higher manufacturing expenses for the cost of conducting our two Phase III clinical trials PRIMO CABG2 and APEX AMI in pexelizumab and the increased production of material used in our clinical trials involving Soliris and pexelizumab. The increase in payroll and benefits from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the increase in staff involved in clinical and manufacturing development as well as regulatory and quality assurance activities. The decrease in discovery research is due principally to recognition of the approximately $1,300 balance of the non refundable payment received from XOMA. In 2003, XOMA paid an upfront non refundable fee of approximately $1,500 pursuant to a collaborative agreement. We recorded the payment as a deferred research and development payment and amortized the payment as a reduction of research and development expense. Upon cancellation of the XOMA collaborative agreement in 2005, the remaining balance of $1,300 was recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses. Our collaboration with P&G resulted in pexelizumab related product development costs, excluding payroll related costs, of $36,358 for the 2005 compared to $15,902 for 2004 representing 57% and 46%, respectively, of our product development costs. The remaining balance of our product development costs was primarily for Soliris and other pre clinical product candidates. 57 Our general and administrative expenses were $18,951 and $14,459 for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,492 from 2004 to 2005 was due principally to increased pre commercial activities associated with our two lead product candidates, as well as increased headcount in support of our operations. Total operating expenses were $110,339 and $75,059 for the years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment income was $5,266 for the year ended July 31, 2005 compared to $3,373 for the year ended July 31, 2004. The increase in investment income of $1,893 in 2005 resulted primarily from higher interest rates and higher principal amounts. Interest expense was $6,125 for the year ended July 31, 2005 compared to $7,709 for the year ended July 31, 2004. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the lower interest rate for the 1.375% Notes issued in January 2005 which replaced the previous outstanding notes with a rate of 5.75%. We recorded a $3,185 loss from early extinguishment of the 5.75% Notes, which consisted of the write off of the remaining balance of non refundable deferred financing costs of approximately $1,200 and the redemption premium of approximately $2,000. During the first fiscal quarter of 2005 we recorded a net gain to other income of $3,804 to complete the termination of the Unigraft xenotransplantation program at Columbus Farming Corporation, or CFC. This consisted of the extinguishment of the $3,900 note payable used to purchase the xenotransplantation assets and the extinguishment of the accrued interest of $300 on the note, partially offset by the transfer to Tyco International, Ltd., or Tyco, of the remaining assets of $450 used to secure the note. (See section entitled Business Other Preclinical Programs Unigraft Xenotransplantation Technologies Program). A state tax benefit of $765 and $691 was recognized for the year ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our July 31, 2005 and actual exchange of our July 31, 2004 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $108,750 and $74,095 or $3.90 and $3.43 basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2004 and 2003 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned contract research revenues of $4,609 and $877 for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $4,000 milestone payment from P&G concurrent with the dosing of our first patient in the APEX AMI trial. Substantially all of the other revenue in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from the $10,000 upfront fee paid to us by P&G in February 1999. Revenue from U.S. government grants totaled $21 in fiscal 2004 and $204 in fiscal 2003. During fiscal year 2004, we incurred research and development expenses of $59,840 compared to fiscal year 2003 were we incurred research and development expenses of $71,042. We report research and development costs by category incurred rather than by project. The $11,202 decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 resulted principally from lower product development costs due to the completion of the pexelizumab Phase III 58 PRIMO CABG clinical trial and lower manufacturing development and manufacturing activities resulting from the amended manufacturing agreement with Lonza and the timing related to the manufacture of pexelizumab. We also incurred lower costs for discovery research due to lower external research and license fees and the suspension of the UniGraft program at CFC. These lower expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits costs and increased occupancy and depreciation costs. Our collaboration with P&G resulted in pexelizumab related product development costs, excluding payroll related costs, of $15,902 for 2004 compared to $25,016 for the 2003 representing 46% and 59%, respectively, of our product development costs. The remaining balance of our product development costs was primarily for Soliris (eculizumab) and other pre clinical product candidates. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $3,590 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to 2003 was due principally to increased pre commercial and business development activities in support of our PNH clinical trials as well as continued growth of our operations. Total operating expenses were $75,059 and $84,471 for the years ended July 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Investment income was $3,373 for the year ended July 31, 2004 compared to $5,809 for the year ended July 31, 2003. The decrease in investment income of $2,436 in 2004 resulted primarily from lower interest rates and lower principal amounts. Interest expense was $7,709 for the year ended July 31, 2004 compared to $7,694 for the year ended July 31, 2003. A state tax benefit of $691 and $1,012 was recognized for the year ended July 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our July 31, 2004 and actual exchange of our July 31, 2003 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $74,095 and $84,467 or $3.43 and $4.64 basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts) Since our inception in 1992, our primary source of cash is through public offerings of our common stock and the sale of convertible notes. Other sources include debt financing, payments received under corporate collaborations and grants, and equipment and leasehold improvements financing. Our primary use of cash includes business development activities and research and development. As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $212,456 compared with $195,404 at July 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of 2,500,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at $26.75 per share, resulting in gross proceeds from the sale of $66,875. We incurred underwriting discounts and commissions of $2,145, or $0.86 per share as well as other expenses, resulting in net proceeds of $64,517, which were partially offset by cash used to fund operating activities. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the five month period ended December 31, 2005 was $50,365. The increase compared to the prior five month period ended December 31, 2004 is primarily due to increased Research and Development spending in the current period. 59 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the five month period ended December 31, 2005 was $20,559. This included $20,115 of purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from the maturity or sale of marketable securities, and $444 of property, plant and equipment additions. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the five month period ended December 31, 2005 was $67,610, consisting of proceeds from the sale of common stock of $64,517, the exercise of stock options of $3,474, offset by the exchange of 13,713 treasury shares at a cost of $381. Sufficiency of Cash Resources We anticipate that our existing capital resources as of December 31, 2005, as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us with adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently expected for the next eighteen months. We may pursue additional stock offerings, debt or other sources of funding to finance our operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include our $150,000 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012, or 1.375% Notes, our annual payments of approximately $2,300 for operating and capital leases, principally for facilities and equipment, and an open letter of credit of $200 which serves as a security deposit on our facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: (in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable $ 150.0 $ $ $ $ 150.0 Interest expense 13.6 2.1 4.2 6.3 1.0 Capital and operating leases 12.3 2.5 4.4 4.9 0.5 Total contractual obligations $ 175.9 $ 4.6 $ 8.6 $ 11.2 $ 151.5 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development $ 55.2 $ 18.8 $ 36.4 $ $ Clinical and manufacturing development related to collaboration with P&G 20.0 20.0 Total clinical and manufacturing development 75.2 38.8 36.4 Licenses 3.6 0.4 1.3 1.4 0.5 Research and development 0.4 0.2 0.2 Total commercial commitments $ 79.2 $ 39.4 $ 37.9 $ 1.4 $ 0.5 60 Convertible Senior Notes In January 2005 we sold $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The interest rate on the notes is 1.375% per annum on the principal amount from January 25, 2005, payable semi annually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2005. The 1.375% Notes is convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 31.7914 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.46 per share). We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. We do not have financial covenants related to our 1.375% Notes. However, there are certain designated events which could occur such as a liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, or otherwise, in connection with which 50% or more of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least 90% common stock that is listed on a U.S. national exchange or market. If the holder elects to convert its 1.375% Notes upon the occurrence of a designated event, the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date. These additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option, are set according to a table within the offering document, and are capped (in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed 42.9100 shares per $1,000 principal amount). We incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of the 1.375% Notes of approximately $4,800, which are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the seven year term of the notes. Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2007. The assets and liabilities under capital lease are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The interest rate on the above capital lease is 5.625% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Amortization and interest expense for the five month period ended December 31, 2005 and the years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004 was $57, $55, and $0, respectively. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We lease our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The lease has an initial term expiring in December 2010. At this site, we lease a total of 89,000 square feet of space. We pay a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses. Our pilot manufacturing plant, which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials, is expected to remain in New Haven, Connecticut and encompasses approximately 33,000 square feet of labs and offices. The lease in New Haven has an initial term ending in October 2007 with three options to extend for one year each. Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, leases approximately 25,000 square feet of labs, office space and unimproved storage in San Diego, California. The lease expires in August 2012. We believe our research and development facilities and pilot manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our current ongoing activities. 61 Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of cancelable research and development, licenses, operations, clinical development including clinical trials, and manufacturing cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs (assuming we utilize our long term commercial scale product manufacturing capacity), which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our agreement with Lonza Biologics, PLC and our collaboration with P&G Pharmaceuticals. Lonza Agreement The Large Scale Product Supply Agreement dated December 18, 2002, or the Lonza Agreement, between Lonza Biologics PLC, or Lonza, and us, relating to the manufacture of our product candidate Soliris, was amended, or the Lonza Amendment, in April 2004. Under the Lonza Amendment, the facility in which Lonza will manufacture Soliris is changed; the manufacturing capacity we are required to purchase is reduced; and future potential payments of $10,000 by us to Lonza relating to achievement of Soliris sales milestones and of up to $15,000 payable by us relating to manufacturing yields achieved by Lonza are eliminated. In August 2004 we paid Lonza an additional $3,500 as a non refundable advance under the Lonza Amendment. In addition, the amounts we would be required to pay in connection with a voluntary termination of the Lonza Agreement by us have been changed. Under the Lonza Agreement, as amended by the Lonza Amendment, if we terminate the Lonza Agreement on or prior to September 30, 2006, we may be required to pay different amounts, depending on when the Lonza Agreement is terminated, which are between zero and approximately $10,000 and, if we terminate the Lonza Agreement after September 30, 2006, we may be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture up to 12 months following termination. P&G Pharmaceuticals Collaboration In December 2001, we and P&G entered into a binding memorandum of understanding, or MOU, pursuant to which the January 1999 collaboration was revised. Under the revised structure per the MOU, we and P&G share decision making and responsibility for all future U.S. development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab, including clinical, manufacturing, marketing, and sales efforts. The revised collaboration per the MOU provides that we and P&G each incur approximately 50% of all Phase III clinical trial, product development and manufacturing, and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the U.S. and that we will receive approximately 50% of the gross margin on U.S. sales, if any. P&G agreed to retain responsibility for future development and commercialization costs outside the U.S., with us receiving a royalty on sales outside the U.S., if any. We are responsible for royalties on certain third party intellectual property worldwide, if such intellectual property is necessary. Additionally, as part of the MOU, we will receive milestone payments for achieving specified development steps, regulatory filings and approvals. We and P&G have agreed, as per the MOU, that we share concurrently 50% of the ongoing U.S. pre production and development manufacturing costs for pexelizumab as well as any AMI or CABG Phase III clinical trial costs. Our net share of total commercial commitments related to the collaboration, in 2006, is expected to be approximately $20,000 and will primarily be related to completion of clinical trials. P&G has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its rights at any time. If P&G terminates the collaboration, as per the MOU, P&G is required to contribute its share of agreed to obligations and costs incurred 62 prior to the termination, but may not be required to contribute towards obligations incurred after termination. In such circumstance all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab would revert back to us and we would be entitled to all future pexelizumab revenues, if any, without any sharing of revenues, if any, with P&G. If P&G were to sublicense its rights, the sub licensee would be required to assume all of P&Gs obligations under the collaboration. We rely on P&G for the development, manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab. Termination of our agreement by P&G or sublicense of its collaboration rights could cause significant delays in the development, manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab and result in significant additional costs to us. Under terms of our MOU we may be obligated to reimburse P&G for 50% of cancellation costs under P&Gs third party pexelizumab manufacturing contract. Our portion of those cancellation costs could amount to as much as $8,000. Additional Payments Additional payments, aggregating up to approximately $23,000, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current pre clinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). Approximately $150 of these costs may be incurred in the next three years. Taxes For tax reporting purposes, as of December 31, 2005, we have available for federal tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $493,312 which expire through 2026 (of which approximately $29,895 resulted from the exercise of nonqualified stock options). We also have federal and state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately $17,806 which begin to expire commencing in 2008. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limitation provisions were triggered in 1995 however, the limitation to us has been eliminated as of December 31, 2005. For the years ended July 31 2005 and 2004, the limitation is approximately $1,402 annually. There is no future limitation as a result of this change in ownership. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements and changes the requirements of the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. This statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03 1 provides guidance on other than temporary 63 impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS 115 and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired. In November 2005, the FASB approved the issuance of FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The FSP addresses when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. The FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary. The FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 with earlier application permitted. For Alexion, the effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of this accounting principle is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Currently, we maintain approximately 17% of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less, 37% in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year, and the remaining 46% in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than two years. These financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. We estimate that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a $698 decrease or increase in the fair value of our cash and investments, which had a weighted average duration of approximately 4 months at December 31, 2005. Our outstanding long term liabilities as of December 31, 2005 consisted of $150,000 of our 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012. As the notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes. Although future borrowings may bear interest at a floating rate, and would therefore be affected by interest rate changes, we cannot reasonably estimate the effect and therefore do not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition. Accordingly, we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item. As of December 31, 2005, the market value of our $150,000 1.375% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2012, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $129,750.
