Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) This report contains forward looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements are subject to certain factors, which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors. Overview We are a biotechnology company working to develop and deliver life changing drug therapies for patients with serious and life threatening medical conditions. We are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states, including hematologic diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Since our incorporation in January 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery, research, and product and clinical development. Since September 2005, we have formed a number of wholly owned foreign and domestic entities to support commercial and regulatory operations. In July 2006, we acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island, for the future commercial production of our products. In September 2006, we filed a Biologics License Application, or BLA, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe, for Soliris (eculizumab) for the treatment of a rare, life threatening blood disorder known as Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PNH. The Phase III clinical development program for Soliris (eculizumab) in PNH is comprised of two Phase III clinical trials, known as TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD. The FDA agreed to the design of the protocols for these two trials under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process. TRIUMPH is a placebo controlled efficacy trial and SHEPHERD is an open label, non placebo controlled safety trial with efficacy secondary endpoints. In January 2006, we reported positive results from TRIUMPH, which results were later published in the September 2006 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. All pre specified, primary and secondary endpoints in the TRIUMPH trial were achieved with statistical significance. In December 2006, we reported positive results from SHEPHERD. Soliris (eculizumab) appeared to be safe and well tolerated during the twelve month SHEPHERD trial, and all pre specified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in the SHEPHERD trial were achieved with statistical significance. Data from TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD served as the primary basis for the BLA and MAA submitted in the United States and Europe, respectively. In November 2006, we received priority review designation for the Soliris (eculizumab) BLA from the FDA. Priority review status is granted by the FDA to products that, if approved, would be a significant improvement over existing therapies. Similarly, in August 2006, we announced that our Soliris (eculizumab) MAA was granted accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, in Europe. Review under the Accelerated Assessment Procedure is provided by the EMEA for medicinal products of major therapeutic interest and shortens the timeframe for review by that agency. In November 2006, we also announced that the EMEA had validated the Soliris MAA allowing for commencement of the review process. In addition to our Phase III PNH clinical program, we are conducting the following efforts: (1) the EMBRACE Expanded Access Trial, (2) the EXPLORE diagnostics trial and (3) a global Patient Registry for PNH patients. The EMBRACE trial (The Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Early Access Treatment Protocol) was initiated in December 2006 to provide the investigational agent eculizumab in the United States to 48 Table of Contents PNH patients in accordance with a Treatment Protocol authorized by the FDA. Treatment Protocols are designed to make promising investigational agents available for patients with serious or life threatening diseases for which there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapies, before general marketing is authorized. We initiated the EXPLORE trial in August 2006 to investigate the frequency and clinical characteristics of undiagnosed PNH patients who have been diagnosed with other bone marrow failure diseases such as aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia. The global PNH Patient Registry involves the study of the natural history of PNH. In addition to PNH, we are considering the evaluation of other potential indications for Soliris (eculizumab) as well as other formulations of eculizumab for additional clinical indications, and we are actively pursuing development of other antibody product candidates in early stages of development. During 2006, we completed a final Phase III trial of another product candidate known as pexelizumab with our partner for this product, Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals. After reviewing results from that trial, we along with Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, have determined not to pursue further development of pexelizumab. To date, we have not received any revenues from the sale of our products. We have incurred operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $637,723. We expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development, pre clinical studies and clinical testing, regulatory activities, manufacturing development, scale up and commercial scale manufacturing, pre commercialization activities, developing a sales and marketing force, and other infrastructure support costs. We may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs. In November 2006, we sold 3,450,000 shares of our common stock in a registered offering at a price to the public of $43.00 per share resulting in proceeds of approximately $140,229, net of underwriting discount, fees and other expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. We do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing, development, or sale of our drug candidates. In January 2005, we sold $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If the holder elects to convert its 1.375% Notes upon the occurrence of a designated event, the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date. These additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option, are set according to a table within the offering document, and are capped (in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed 42.9100 per $1 principal amount). Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates In our preparation of consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Our estimates are often based on judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our result of operations. 49 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Marketable Securities We invest in marketable debt securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity. We believe that our conservative investment policy ensures reasonable assurance against impairment of marketable securities held, and also enables us to avoid incurring realized losses that could occur if securities were not held to maturity. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined under the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products, subsequent to the filing of our Biologics License Application, or BLA, but prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process. Our assessment includes any known constraints and impediments to approval, including safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication for which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. There is a risk inherent in these judgments, and we would be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. These reserves are determined based on significant estimates. A substantial amount of our current Soliris (eculizumab) inventory was manufactured early enough in the regulatory process that we determined to expense the full manufacturing cost. Approximately 100 patient years of Soliris (eculizumab) inventory is sellable and fully expensed. Long Lived Assets We assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important, and which could trigger an impairment review, include, among others, the following: a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset; and a significant decrease in market value of assets. 50 Table of Contents If we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable, based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, such amount is recognized as an impairment charge. Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets, and is not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable. No impairment charge resulted upon the adoption of this standard or as a result of our annual impairment assessment. The first step of the review is to compare the fair market capitalization of Alexion, annually in November, to our net stockholders equity. If fair market capitalization is greater than net stockholders equity, then no impairment charges are necessary. The analysis is impacted by the price of the stock on the date of the test. Impairment charges, if any, will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined. Prepaid Manufacturing Costs Cash advances paid by us to secure future long term manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs. These costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method. The cash advances are subject to refund if the manufacturing facility is unavailable as scheduled or forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production. We evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value, or NRV. If estimated NRV were to be negative, all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense. Our calculation of NRV involves estimates of expected sales volume, sales price, and market penetration of the product in question. Revenue Recognition We record contract research revenues from research and development support payments, license fees and milestone payments under collaborations with third parties, and amounts received from various government grants. We evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting. Deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. Up front, non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved, provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period. Research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities. Deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, pre clinical, 51 Table of Contents clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, manufacturing development and scale up costs, contract services and other outside contractor costs, research license fees, depreciation and amortization of lab facilities, and lab supplies. Theses costs are expensed when incurred. We have entered into a collaboration research agreement with P&G in which we share costs. We record these costs as research and development expenses as incurred. A portion of these costs are reimbursed by our collaborator and are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense. Accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work performed on our behalf. At the end of each period, we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Stock Based Compensation We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), effective August 1, 2005. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net earnings. We have elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, shall be recognized in the periods after the date of adoption. Due to our net loss position, a windfall tax benefit was not realized during the period. As of December 31, 2006, there was $30,713 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years. Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. Also, of significance, is our expected term until exercise. We currently use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. Once employee stock option values are determined, they may not be changed. We continually seek to refine and improve our assumptions used to measure the value of employee stock options. Foreign Currency Translation For our foreign subsidiary with a functional currency different from U.S. dollars, we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities the average exchange rate prevailing during each period for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rate for our investments in our foreign subsidiary. Adjustments from translating these financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 52 Table of Contents Results of Operations On December 9, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31. The five months results reported relate to the transition period ended December 31, 2005. The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, Five Month PeriodEnded December 31, Year Ended July 31, 2006 2005 2005 2004 2005 2004 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Contract research revenues: P&G $ 588 $ 588 $ 245 $ 245 $ 588 $ 4,588 U.S. government grants 870 894 419 476 21 Other revenue 100 Total revenues 1,558 1,482 664 245 1,064 4,609 Research and development expenses: Clinical development 32,262 52,473 21,966 12,810 43,314 20,398 Manufacturing and manufacturing development 4,794 23,430 10,714 8,119 20,835 14,027 Product development 37,056 75,903 32,680 20,929 64,149 34,425 Payroll and benefits 30,061 21,202 10,481 6,662 17,397 14,749 Discovery research 8,214 2,572 1,620 1,479 2,431 3,592 Operating, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization 7,894 8,078 3,457 2,844 7,411 7,074 Total research and development expenses 83,225 107,755 48,238 31,914 91,388 59,840 General and administrative 54,879 25,509 12,763 6,160 18,951 14,459 Impairment of fixed assets 539 760 Total operating expenses 138,643 133,264 61,001 38,074 110,339 75,059 Operating loss (137,085 ) (131,782 ) (60,337 ) (37,829 ) (109,275 ) (70,450 ) Other income (expense): Investment income 8,076 6,633 3,123 1,756 5,266 3,373 Interest expense (2,837 ) (4,164 ) (1,192 ) (3,153 ) (6,125 ) (7,709 ) Gain from extinguishment of note payable 3,804 3,804 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (3,185 ) (3,185 ) Other (41 ) 0 Total other income (expense) 5,198 (716 ) 1,931 2,407 (240 ) (4,336 ) State tax benefit 373 1,154 450 61 765 691 Net loss $ (131,514 ) $ (131,344 ) $ (57,956 ) $ (35,361 ) $ (108,750 ) $ (74,095 ) Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (4.15 ) $ (4.30 ) $ (1.90 ) $ (1.28 ) $ (3.90 ) $ (3.43 ) 53 Table of Contents Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned revenues of approximately $1,558 and $1,482 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue reflects the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from P&G under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab, U.S. government funded research grant revenue related to our research programs, and a nonrefundable fee for exclusive access to our xenotransplantation technologies, a program that was terminated in October 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred research and development expenses of $83,225 compared to the same period in 2005 where we incurred research and development expenses of $107,755. We report research and development costs by the category in which they are incurred, rather than by project. Our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, product development costs, discovery research costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and occupancy related facility operating costs. Product development costs consist of pre clinical costs, clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs, manufacturing development and manufacturing costs. The $24,530 decrease in research and development expenses resulted primarily from a significant decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses costs, $20,211 and $18,636, respectively, related to the termination of the pexelizumab programs. These decreases in total research and development were partially offset by substantial increases in payroll and benefits costs of $8,859, which were primarily impacted by the adoption of SFAS 123R and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants as well as increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities. In addition, research and discovery expenses increased by approximately $5,642, primarily related to development activities related to our PNH programs. We anticipate that expenses for research and development will remain at a significant level in 2007 as critical and substantive clinical trials near their completion and as we may initiate development of other promising candidates. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $55,418, which include impairment costs of $539, compared to the same period in 2005 where we incurred general and administrative expenses of $25,509 The increase in general and administrative expenses of $29,909 from 2005 to 2006 was due principally to increased pre commercial activities associated with Soliris in the U.S. as well as in Europe, increased headcount in support of our operations, and $7,087 of expenses related to the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc. Excluding the effect of the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies, we expect that general and administrative costs will increase in fiscal 2007 as we continue to put in place the commercial organization and infrastructure required to bring Soliris to market. Total operating expenses were $138,643 and $133,264 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Investment income was $8,076 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $6,633 for the same period in 2005, reflecting higher market interest rates and higher principal amounts. Interest expense decreased to $2,799 from $4,164, impacted by the lower coupon rate of the convertible debt of $150,000 principal amount of 54 Table of Contents 1.375% convertible senior notes, or 1.375% Notes, following redemption of our $120,000 principal amount of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes, or 5.75% Notes, in March 2005. A state tax benefit of $373 and $450 was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our December 31, 2006 and 2005 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $131,514 and $131,344 or $4.15 and $4.30 basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Comparison of the Five Months Ended December 31, 2005 to the Five Months Ended December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned contract research revenues of $664 and $245 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the revenue earned for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, $245 is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from a $10,000 upfront fee paid to us by P&G in February 1999. Revenue from U.S. government grants totaled $419 and $0 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in revenues associated with U.S. government grants obtained in the transition period ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from research under the anti anthrax bio defense program. During the five months ended December 31, 2005, we incurred research and development expenses of $48,238 compared to the five months ended December 31, 2004 where we incurred research and development expenses of $31,914. We report our research and development costs by the category in which they are incurred rather than by project. Our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, product development costs, discovery research costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and occupancy related facility operating costs. Product development costs consist of pre clinical costs, clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs, manufacturing development and manufacturing costs. The $16,324 increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from greater product development costs of $11,751 from higher clinical development and higher manufacturing expenses costs related to the current Phase III clinical trials of our lead drug candidates, Soliris (eculizumab) and pexelizumab, for TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD, and the PNH extension trials and PRIMO CABG2 and APEX AMI trials, respectively. Payroll and benefits costs were impacted by the adoption of SFAS 123R and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants as well as increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities. Our collaboration with P&G resulted in pexelizumab related product development costs, excluding payroll related costs, of $17,805 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $11,121 for the five months ended December 31, 2004. This represented 54% and 53%, respectively, of our product development costs. The remaining balance of our product development costs was primarily for Soliris and other pre clinical product candidates. Our general and administrative expenses were $12,763 for the period, compared with $6,160 for the same period last year. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $6,603 from 2004 to 2005 was principally from expensing of employee stock options, increased headcount dedicated to commercial 55 Table of Contents development activities and higher professional fees principally for patent and compliance activities. The impact on payroll and benefits expenses from the adoption of SFAS 123R was material, but the overall increase in expenses was predominantly driven by our ongoing development of a commercial organization that will ultimately support sales and marketing of product candidates, if approved by regulatory agencies. Total operating expenses were $61,001 and $38,074 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment income was $3,123 for the five months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,756 for the same period in 2004, reflecting higher market interest rates and a higher principal balance. The higher principal balance is a result of the August 2005 issuance of 2,500,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at $26.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds from the sale of $64,530, as well as an increase in convertible debt due to the sale of $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes, or 1.375% Notes, in January 2005, which was partially offset by the redemption of our $120,000 principal amount of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes, or 5.75% Notes, in March 2005. Interest expense decreased to $1,192 from $3,153, impacted by the lower coupon rate of the 1.375% Notes. A state tax benefit of $450 and $61 was recognized for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our December 31, 2005 and 2004 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $57,956 and $35,361 or $1.90 and $1.28 basic and diluted net loss per share for the five months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) We earned contract research revenues of $1,064 and $4,609 for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $4,000 milestone payment from P&G concurrent with the dosing of our first patient in the APEX AMI trial. Substantially all of the other revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 is a non cash item representing the amortization of deferred revenue from the $10,000 upfront fee paid to us by P&G in February 1999. Revenue from U.S. government grants totaled $476 in fiscal 2005 and $21 in fiscal 2004. The $455 increase in revenues associated with U.S. government grants obtained in fiscal 2005 resulted from research under the anti anthrax bio defense program. During fiscal year 2005, we incurred research and development expenses of $91,388 compared to fiscal year 2004 when we incurred research and development expenses of $59,840. We report research and development costs by category incurred rather than by project. Our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs, pre clinical costs, clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs, manufacturing development and manufacturing costs, discovery research costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and occupancy related facility operating costs. The $31,548 increase in research and development expenses from 2004 to 2005 resulted primarily from greater product development costs of $29,724 from higher clinical development and higher manufacturing expenses for the cost of conducting our two Phase III clinical trials PRIMO CABG2 and APEX AMI in pexelizumab and the increased production of material used in our clinical trials involving Soliris and 56 Table of Contents pexelizumab. The increase in payroll and benefits from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the increase in staff involved in clinical and manufacturing development as well as regulatory and quality assurance activities. The decrease in discovery research is due principally to recognition of the approximately $1,300 balance of the non refundable payment received from XOMA. In 2003, XOMA paid an upfront non refundable fee of approximately $1,500 pursuant to a collaborative agreement. We recorded the payment as a deferred research and development payment and amortized the payment as a reduction of research and development expense. Upon cancellation of the XOMA collaborative agreement in 2005, the remaining balance of $1,300 was recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses. Our collaboration with P&G resulted in pexelizumab related product development costs, excluding payroll related costs, of $36,358 for the 2005 compared to $15,902 for 2004 representing 57% and 46%, respectively, of our product development costs. The remaining balance of our product development costs was primarily for Soliris and other pre clinical product candidates. Our general and administrative expenses were $18,951 and $14,459 for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,492 from 2004 to 2005 was due principally to increased pre commercial activities associated with our two lead product candidates, as well as increased headcount in support of our operations. Total operating expenses were $110,339 and $75,059 for the years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment income was $5,266 for the year ended July 31, 2005 compared to $3,373 for the year ended July 31, 2004. The increase in investment income of $1,893 in 2005 resulted primarily from higher interest rates and higher principal amounts. Interest expense was $6,125 for the year ended July 31, 2005 compared to $7,709 for the year ended July 31, 2004. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the lower interest rate for the 1.375% Notes issued in January 2005, which replaced the previous outstanding notes with a rate of 5.75%. We recorded a $3,185 loss from early extinguishment of the 5.75% Notes, which consisted of the write off of the remaining balance of non refundable deferred financing costs of approximately $1,200 and the redemption premium of approximately $2,000. During the first fiscal quarter of 2005, we recorded a net gain to other income of $3,804 to complete the termination of the Unigraft xenotransplantation program at Columbus Farming Corporation, or CFC. This consisted of the extinguishment of the $3,900 note payable used to purchase the xenotransplantation assets and the extinguishment of the accrued interest of $300 on the note, partially offset by the transfer to Tyco International, Ltd., or Tyco, of the remaining assets of $450 used to secure the note. A state tax benefit of $765 and $691 was recognized for the year ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our July 31, 2005 and actual exchange of our July 31, 2004 incremental research and development tax credits. As a result of the above factors, we incurred net losses of $108,750 and $74,095 or $3.90 and $3.43 basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 57 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts) Since our inception in 1992, our primary source of cash is through public offerings of our common stock and the sale of convertible notes. Other sources include debt financing, payments received under corporate collaborations and grants, and equipment and leasehold improvements financing. Our primary use of cash includes business development activities and research and development. As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $250,148 compared with $212,456 at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of 3,450,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at $43.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds from the sale of $148,350. We incurred underwriting discounts and commissions of $7,788, or $2.26 per share as well as other expenses, resulting in net proceeds of $140,229, which was substantially offset by cash used to fund operating activities. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $109,914. The decrease compared to the balance as of December 31, 2005 is primarily due to working capital fluctuations driven by increased prepaid expenses and inventory balances and decreased accrued expense balance, offset partly by increased accounts payable balance. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $53,907. This included $119,357 of proceeds from the maturity or sale of marketable securities, net of purchases of marketable securities, offset by property, plant and equipment additions of $31,856 and increases in restricted cash of $33,594. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $179,324, consisting of proceeds from the sale of common stock of $140,229, proceeds from the mortgage loan of $26,000 and the exercise of stock options of $13,598, offset by the acquisition of 6,919 treasury shares at a cost of $279 and payment on capital leases of $224. Sufficiency of Cash Resources We anticipate that our existing capital resources as of December 31, 2006, as well as cash from investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us with adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently expected for the next eighteen months. We may pursue additional stock offerings, debt or other sources of funding to finance our operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include our $150,000 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012, or 1.375% Notes, our $26,000 mortgage loan due August 2016 with a fixed annual interest rate of 9.17%, our annual payments of approximately $4,000 for operating and capital leases, principally for facilities and 58 Table of Contents equipment, and an open letter of credit of $200 which serves as a security deposit on our facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: (in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable $ 150.0 $ $ $ $ 150.0 Mortgage loan 26.0 2.9 6.9 16.2 Interest expense 25.7 4.5 8.9 7.7 4.6 Capital and operating leases 26.4 3.8 6.3 5.1 11.2 Total contractual obligations $ 228.1 $ 8.3 $ 18.1 $ 19.7 $ 182.0 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development $ 55.1 $ 27.8 $ 27.3 $ $ Licenses 3.5 1.2 1.1 0.8 0.4 Research and development 0.1 0.1 Total commercial commitments $ 58.7 $ 29.1 $ 28.4 $ 0.8 $ 0.4 Convertible Senior Notes In January 2005, we sold $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The interest rate on the notes is 1.375% per annum on the principal amount from January 25, 2005, payable semi annually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2005. The 1.375% Notes is convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 31.7914 shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.46 per share). We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. We do not have financial covenants related to our 1.375% Notes. However, there are certain designated events which could occur such as a liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, or otherwise, in connection with which 50% or more of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive, consideration which is not at least 90% common stock that is listed on a U.S. national exchange or market. If the holder elects to convert its 1.375% Notes upon the occurrence of a designated event, the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date. These additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option, are set according to a table within the offering document, and are capped (in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed 42.9100 shares per $1 principal amount). 59 Table of Contents We incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of the 1.375% Notes of approximately $4,800, which are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the seven year term of the notes. Purchase of Manufacturing Facility On July 13, 2006, our wholly owned affiliate, Alexion Manufacturing LLC purchased a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island from Dow Chemical Company for $13,000,000. The biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility will be used primarily to produce Soliris (eculizumab). Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated April 13, 2006, or the purchase agreement, we acquired rights to approximately a 55,000 square foot facility, certain equipment located at, or used in connection with, the facility and certain rights under service contracts related to the facility. We deposited into an escrow account $500,000 upon execution of the purchase agreement on April 13, 2006 and an additional $500,000 upon the completion of the due diligence period in July 2006. The deposits were held in escrow until the closing date at which time the escrowed amounts and the remaining balance, net of property taxes owed for the first part of the year, of $11,926,289 was paid to Dow. Mortgage Loan In July 2006, our wholly owned affiliate Alexion Manufacturing, LLC, entered into a mortgage loan agreement to borrow $26,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.17% and all obligations under the loan agreement are guaranteed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The loan principal is required to be repaid in equal monthly instalments of $289, starting March 2009 and until August 2016, at which time all outstanding balances are due. The loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to July 2009. After that date the loan can be prepaid in whole, but not in part, and must include a prepayment premium as described in the loan agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, among other things, Alexion Manufacturing, LLC is restricted with respect to additional borrowings, leasing arrangements and mergers. In the event that approval to market Soliris (eculizumab) has not been obtained before December 31, 2007, Alexion Manufacturing LLC must deliver an acceptable letter of credit to the lender for the amount of $13,000. Also, included in the loan agreement are certain provisions which, if satisfied, would allow for additional borrowings of up to $9,000. Under the terms of the agreement, among other things, Alexion Manufacturing is restricted with respect to additional borrowings, leasing arrangements and mergers. Alexion Manufacturing also may not modify, amend, or waive material obligations with respect to, or terminate, material agreements or proprietary rights, or engage in any business other than ownership and operation of facility. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. may not, among other things, liquidate wind up or dissolve as long as the guarantee remains in effect. As a condition of the loan, Alexion Manufacturing, LLC is required to maintain restricted cash accounts. These accounts must be used specifically for the purchase and construction of the manufacturing facility. The lender has a first priority security interest and the right to approve all disbursements from the accounts holding restricted cash. Under the agreement, we are required to, at all times, maintain a balance in the restricted cash accounts sufficient to complete the project. Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2010. The assets and liabilities under capital lease are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the 60 Table of Contents fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The interest rate on the above capital lease is 22.1% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We lease our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The lease, which had an initial term of ten years and six months, expiring in December 2010, was extended in August 2006 to expire in July 2017. At this site, we lease a total of 129,000 square feet of space. We pay a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses. Our pilot manufacturing plant, which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials, is located in New Haven, Connecticut and encompasses approximately 33,000 square feet of labs and offices. The lease in New Haven has an initial term ending in October 2007 with three options to extend for one year each. Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, leases approximately 17,000 square feet of labs, office space, and unimproved storage in San Diego, California. The lease in San Diego expires in August 2012. We believe our research and development facilities and pilot manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our current ongoing activities. Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of cancelable research and development, licenses, operations, clinical development including clinical trials, and manufacturing cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs (assuming we utilize our long term commercial scale product manufacturing capacity), which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our agreement with Lonza Biologics, PLC and our collaboration with Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals. Lonza Agreement The Large Scale Product Supply Agreement dated December 18, 2002, or the Lonza Agreement, between Lonza Biologics PLC, or Lonza, and us, relating to the manufacture of our product candidate Soliris (eculizumab), was amended, or the Lonza Amendment, in April 2004. Under the Lonza Amendment, the facility in which Lonza will manufacture Soliris is changed; the manufacturing capacity we are required to purchase is reduced; and future potential payments of $10,000 by us to Lonza relating to achievement of Soliris sales milestones and of up to $15,000 payable by us relating to manufacturing yields achieved by Lonza are eliminated. In August 2004, we paid Lonza an additional $3,500 as a non refundable advance under the Lonza Amendment. In addition, the amounts we would be required to pay in connection with a voluntary termination of the Lonza Agreement by us have been changed. Under the current Agreement, if we terminate the Agreement after September 30, 2006, we may be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture up to 12 months following termination. P&G Pharmaceuticals Collaboration In January 1999, we and Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, or P&G, entered into an exclusive collaboration to develop and commercialize pexelizumab. We granted P&G an exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab, with the right to sublicense. 61 Table of Contents In December 2001, we and P&G entered into a binding memorandum of understanding, or MOU, pursuant to which the January 1999 collaboration was revised. We and P&G have agreed, as per the MOU, that we will share concurrently 50% of the ongoing U.S. pre production and development manufacturing costs for pexelizumab as well as any AMI or CABG Phase III clinical trial costs. P&G has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its rights at any time. If P&G terminates the collaboration, as per the MOU, P&G is required to contribute its share of agreed to obligations and costs incurred prior to the termination, but may not be required to contribute towards obligations incurred after termination. In such circumstance all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab would revert back to us and we would be entitled to all future pexelizumab revenues, if any, without any sharing of revenues, if any, with P&G. If P&G were to sublicense its rights, the sub licensee would be required to assume all of P&Gs obligations under the collaboration. During 2006, we completed a final Phase III trial of pexelizumab. After reviewing results from that trial, we along with P&G, have determined not to pursue further development of pexelizumab. Under terms of our MOU we may be obligated to reimburse P&G for 50% of cancellation costs under P&Gs third party pexelizumab manufacturing contract. Our portion of those cancellation costs amounts to approximately $2,000. Additional Payments Additional payments, aggregating up to approximately $8,243, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current pre clinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). Approximately $2,380 of these costs may be incurred in the next three years. Taxes At December 31, 2006, we have available for federal tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $618,061 which expire from 2007 through 2026. We also have federal and state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately $21,891 which expire from 2008 through 2026. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered. However, such limitation is not expected to result in the loss of the federal net operating loss and research and development credit carry forward. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB approved the issuance of FASB Interpretation FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended). This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Additionally, this Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, 62 Table of Contents interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Interpretation is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006 with earlier application permitted. For Alexion, the effective date will be the first quarter of 2007. Management is evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting standard on our financial position and results of operations. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) As of December 31, 2006, we held approximately 77% of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less which includes restricted cash, 6% in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year, and the remaining 17% in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than two years. These financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. We estimate that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $257 in the fair value of our cash and investments, which had a weighted average duration of approximately 1 month at December 31, 2006. Our outstanding long term liabilities as of December 31, 2006 included our $150,000, 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012. As the notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2006, the market value of our $150,000 1.375% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2012, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $217,125. In July 2006, Alexion Manufacturing borrowed $26,000 to purchase and finance construction of the Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate. Accordingly, any changes in the interest rate will not affect our future payments on the loan. Accordingly, we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item.
