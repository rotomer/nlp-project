Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, included at the beginning of this Form 10 K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and delivery of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states, including hematologic and neurologic diseases, cancer and autoimmune disorders. From our inception in January 1992 through early 2007, we devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery, research, and product and clinical development. In March 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted approval for our lead product Soliris&reg; (eculizumab) for the treatment of a rare, life threatening blood disorder known as Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PNH. In June 2007, the European Commission, or E.C., also approved Soliris for the treatment of PNH. Through December 31, 2007, our product sales have been solely attributable to sales of Soliris and have been generated from three sources: commercial sales in the United States (beginning in the second quarter of 2007), named patient sales in certain European countries (beginning in the first quarter of 2007) and commercial sales in certain European countries (beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007). We have incurred operating losses since our inception. We expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flow for additional periods due to costs associated with the commercialization of Soliris in the United States and Europe, pre commercialization activities and anticipated commercialization activities in other territories, development of our manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, including engineering and validation runs, product research and development, preclinical studies and clinical testing, regulatory activities, commercial scale manufacturing at our third party contractor and at our own manufacturing plant when that site is approved to manufacture Soliris, and other infrastructure support costs. Until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations, we expect to continue to finance future cash needs primarily through the use of available cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, availability under our credit agreement and to the extent necessary, through proceeds from equity or debt financings, loans and collaborative agreements. 51 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition Royalties Inventories Prepaid manufacturing Research and development expenses Stock based compensation Long lived assets Income Taxes Revenue Recognition Net Product Sales To date, our product sales have consisted solely of Soliris for the treatment of PNH. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, which are primarily comprised of value added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in the Companys statements of operations, and do not impact net product sales. In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. In some cases, we also sell Soliris to government agencies. Soliris is generally shipped directly from our third party warehouse to the patients health care provider, who is not typically our direct customer. Revenue is recorded on this transaction upon receipt of the product by the patients health care provider, which is typically a hospital or physicians office. Through December 31, 2007, we have recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs in certain European countries. The relevant authorities in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where Soliris has not received formal approval for commercial sales. In Europe, we have entered into transitional agreements with a distributor to distribute Soliris on a named patient basis in specified European countries. We continue to engage with appropriate authorities on the operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes that are separately required by each European country. We are more complete in those 52 Table of Contents processes in certain countries such as Germany, and in earlier stages in other countries such as the United Kingdom. In European countries in which Soliris is currently commercially available and will be commercially available in the future, our customers are expected to be primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies and other health care providers, with the exception of the United Kingdom, in which our primary product sales will be through a distributor. Sales within Europe are recorded upon receipt of product by the health care provider. To date, actual refunds and returns have been negligible. Because of the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and lack of return rights, Soliris customers generally carry limited inventory. Accordingly, we expect that sales related to Soliris will be closely tied to patient demand. We monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether reserves are required related to inventory in our sales channels. To the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates, we will revise these estimates resulting in an impact in the period in which the adjustment was made. We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid and programs in Europe, as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates, including estimates of customer mix, to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to nine months. Upon reconciliation of government reporting to our sales records, we will revise our estimates of rebates payable, which will have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment was made. We also record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue. These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale. Contract Research Revenue We record contract research revenues from research and development support payments, license fees and milestone payments under collaboration with third parties, and amounts received from various government grants. We evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. Deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered item. Up front, non refundable license fees received in connection with collaboration are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the agreement or period of performance obligations. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved, provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred. Revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period. Research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities. Deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts. 53 Table of Contents Royalties We record actual and estimated royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of Soliris. We estimate royalties potentially owed to third parties based on contractual arrangements with certain parties, as well as our assessment of possible royalty amounts owed to other third parties. These estimates may be influenced by the outcome of current litigation, the results of which are uncertain (see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K). On a periodic basis and based on events such as changes in the status of litigation, we may reassess these estimates, resulting in adjustments to cost of sales. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method. We capitalized inventory costs associated with Soliris prior to regulatory approval, but subsequent to the filing of the Biologics License Application, or BLA, when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. Inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a Phase III clinical trial. A significant portion of product sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 was previously expensed prior to submission of our BLA, and therefore is not included in the cost of product revenues during this period. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we fully exhausted this supply of previously expensed inventory. Beginning in 2008, our cost of sales will reflect the full manufacturing cost of the inventory. We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may, after a period of time, no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, at which point we would adjust our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of 42 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to fully realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory. The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements, based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write offs may be required. To date, we have not recorded any material adjustments to our inventory related to excess, expired or obsolete inventory. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply may result in write downs, which would be recorded as adjustments to cost of sales. Prepaid Manufacturing Costs Cash advances paid by us to secure future manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs. These costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method. The cash advances are subject to forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production. 54 Table of Contents We evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value, or NRV. If estimated NRV were to be negative, all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense. Our calculation of NRV involves estimates of expected sales volumes and sales price of Soliris. If actual volumes and prices are substantially less than our estimates, write downs of the prepaid manufacturing balance to cost of sales may be required. Based on our sales forecasts, we expect the carrying value of the prepaid manufacturing costs to be fully realized. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits, preclinical, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, manufacturing development and scale up costs, contract services and other outside contractor costs, research license fees, depreciation and amortization of lab facilities, and lab supplies. These costs are expensed when incurred. Through March 31, 2007, we were involved in a collaboration research agreement with P&G in which we shared costs. We recorded those costs as research and development expenses as incurred. A portion of those costs were reimbursed by our collaborator and were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed. Stock Based Compensation We have one stock based compensation plan known as the 2004 Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual 55 Table of Contents volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of FAS 123(R), the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts. Long Lived Assets We assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important, and which could trigger an impairment review, include, among others, the following: a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset; and a significant decrease in market value of assets. If we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable, based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, such amount is recognized as an impairment charge. Other than the integration plan initiated with our subsidiary, Alexion Antibody Technology, Inc ,we have not experienced a significant triggering event and, therefore, have not recorded any impairment charges related to our long lived assets. To the extent we were to experience a triggering event, particularly as it relates to our largest long lived asset, the Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility, the resulting analysis may require an impairment charge to our statement of operations. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, the principal amount of which is the tax effect of federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $732,653 at December 31, 2007. Future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. In order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. This critical accounting assumption has been historically accurate, as we have not been able to utilize our net deferred tax assets, and we do not expect changes to this assumption until the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets becomes certain. 56 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. The information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere is this Form 10 K. The information for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues: Net product sales $ 66,381 $ $ Contract research revenue 5,660 1,458 1,482 Other revenue 100 Total revenues 72,041 1,558 1,482 Cost of sales 6,696 Research and development expenses: Clinical development 17,294 32,262 52,473 Product development 11,944 4,794 23,430 Discovery research 2,801 8,214 2,572 Payroll and benefits 29,634 30,061 21,202 Operating and occupancy 4,615 5,520 5,408 Depreciation and amortization 2,673 2,374 2,670 Total research and development expenses 68,961 83,225 107,755 Selling, general and administrative 96,142 55,418 25,509 Total operating expenses 165,103 138,643 133,264 Operating loss (99,758 ) (137,085 ) (131,782 ) Other income (expense): Investment income 8,080 8,076 6,633 Interest expense (2,489 ) (2,837 ) (4,164 ) Foreign currency gain (loss) 1,132 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (3,185 ) Other (41 ) Total other income (expense) 6,723 5,198 (716 ) Income tax benefit 745 373 1,154 Net loss $ (92,290 ) $ (131,514 ) $ (131,344 ) Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (2.54 ) $ (4.15 ) $ (4.30 ) 57 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $46,196 and commercial and named patient sales in the European Union of $20,185. Because our commercial and pre approval sales programs did not begin until 2007, there were no sales of Soliris for the year ended December 31, 2006. As additional PNH patients request Soliris and obtain reimbursement, we expect that the number of patients taking Soliris will increase, resulting in an increase in product sales in the U.S. and Europe. We also expect product sales in Europe to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding process in each European country. We recorded contract research revenues of $5,660 and $1,458 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contract research revenues reflect the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from P&G under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab and U.S. government funded research grant revenue for our asthma program. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in contract research revenue, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, was due to the termination of our collaborative agreement with P&G. Effective March 30, 2007, we and P&G agreed to terminate our 1999 collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab. As the agreement has been terminated, the remaining portion of the $10,000 non refundable upfront license fee, or $5,343, was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2007. Due to the termination of the P&G agreement, we expect that future contract research revenue will be dependent upon future awards or grants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the decrease in U.S. government grants, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the conclusion of the anthrax program in 2006. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $6,696 for the year ended December 31, 2007. There were no cost of sales incurred for periods prior to December 31, 2006. Cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris, as well as other manufacturing costs. Changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. We expect that the purchase of patents from OMRF in February 2008 will have a favorable impact on our cost of sales. Product sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our BLA, and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory. Beginning in 2008, our cost of sales will increase, reflecting the full manufacturing cost of the inventory. 58 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred research and development expenses of $68,961, a decrease of $14,264, or 17.1% versus the $83,225 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to, and offset, by the following: Decrease of $14,968 in clinical development expense due largely to decreases in spending for pexelizumab program of $10,022, the reduction or completion of eculizumab programs, including TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD and EXTENSION clinical trials and incurrence of 2006 costs in association with filing the BLA of $7,516. These decreases were offset by increases of $7,850 related to new programs in 2007, including EXPLORE and EMBRACE clinical trials and the PNH registry. Increase of $3,896 in product development expenses due to an increase of $5,518 related to expenditures for drug development, quality assurance, scientific communications and regulatory affairs due to the regulatory approvals in both the United States (March 2007) and the European Union (June 2007). The increase was offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of $1,622 related to the capitalization of inventory costs beginning with filing of the BLA in September 2006. Prior to September 2006, we expensed all manufacturing costs, resulting in lower 2007 expenses compared to 2006. Decrease of $2,160 in discovery research was primarily due to the closure of AAT operations. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2008 as a result of further clinical trials and research related to eculizumab development programs in asthma, myasthenia gravis and multifocal motor neuropathy, as well as the expected initiation of a clinical study of Anti CD200 antibody in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For additional information on these programs, please refer to Product and Development Programs in Item I of this Form 10 K. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $96,142, an increase of $41,263 or 75.2% versus the $54,879 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2007, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $49,521, an increase of $21,863, or 79.0%, versus $27,658 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $18,250 related to our global commercial operations teams. Other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive, finance, information technology, human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity. Increase in non labor commercial operations of $14,087 for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, this increase was comprised primarily of increases in advertising and promotion of Soliris related to the April 2007 commercial launch in the United States and market research related to approval of Soliris in the European Union, as well as promotion of Soliris for commercial launches in certain European countries. Increase in non labor general and administration and information technology of $3,862 for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity. 59 Table of Contents We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase at a reduced rate in 2008, reflecting the completion of our product launch of Soliris in the United States and increased promotion, marketing and other infrastructure costs outside the United States. Other Income (Expense) During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $1,132 of foreign currency gain. There was no foreign currency gain (loss) recorded in 2006. As a result of our European operations, we have exposure, primarily from accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the Euro. During the year ended December 31, 2007, investment income and interest expense were consistent with the results recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an income tax benefit of $745, compared to $373 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the tax benefit was attributable to an increase in the estimated cash exchange of a state incremental research and development tax credit. We expect a reduced tax benefit in 2008 due to a reduction in state research and development credits and the incurrence of state tax liabilities. We will continue to monitor our deferred tax assets through 2008 to determine whether necessary adjustments may be required related to our valuation allowance. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2006 to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Revenues We earned contract research revenues of approximately $1,458 and $1,482 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue reflects the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from P&G under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab, U.S. government funded research grant revenue related to our research programs, and a nonrefundable fee for exclusive access to our xenotransplantation technologies, a program that was terminated in October 2003. Research and Development Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred research and development expenses of $83,225, a decrease of $24,530, or 22.8%, versus the $107,755 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to and offset by the following: a significant decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses costs, $20,211 and $18,636, respectively, related to the termination of the pexelizumab programs. substantial increases in payroll and benefits costs of $8,859, which were primarily impacted by the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants 60 Table of Contents increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities, and research and discovery expenses increased by approximately $5,642, primarily related to development activities related to our PNH programs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $54,879, an increase of $29,370, or 115.1% versus the $25,509 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the following: increased pre commercial activities associated with Soliris in the U.S. as well as in Europe, increased headcount in support of our operations, and increased expenses related to the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc. Other Income (Expenses) During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $8,076 of investment income, representing an increase $1,443, or 21.8%, versus the $6,633 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was a reflection of higher market interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest expense decreased to $2,799 from $4,164, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease resulted from the lower coupon rate on the $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes, following the redemption of our $120,000 principal amount of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes, in March 2005. A state tax benefit of $373 and $1,154 was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, resulting from our estimated exchange of our December 31, 2006 and 2005 incremental research and development tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data) As of December 31, 2007, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash totaled $106,712, a decrease of $143,436, from $250,148 at December 31, 2006. The reduction in cash held was primarily due to our ongoing expenditures for commercialization efforts related to Soliris in the United States and the European Union, expenditures on our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, inventory purchases, and our continuing product research and development efforts. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial, corporate and U.S. Government notes in accordance with our investment policy. As of December 31, 2007, $958 of cash was restricted to be used for the construction and other costs related to our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. At December 31, 2007, our working capital was $167,645, compared to $208,954 at December 31, 2006. 61 Table of Contents We have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. We do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing, development, or sale of Soliris or any of our other drug candidates. We have incurred operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $729,279. We expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flows for additional future periods due to costs associated with the launch and commercialization of Soliris in the United States, pre commercialization activities and anticipated commercialization activities outside of the United States, development of our manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, including engineering and validation runs, product research and development, preclinical studies and clinical testing, regulatory activities, commercial scale manufacturing at our third party contractor and at our own manufacturing plant when that site is qualified to manufacture Soliris, and other infrastructure support costs. Until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations, we expect to continue to finance future cash needs primarily through cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, availability under our credit agreement, and to the extent necessary, through proceeds from equity or debt financings, loans and collaborative agreements. The requirement to obtain additional cash from debt or equity financing will be highly dependent on our sales, and related cash collections, of Soliris in the United States and European Union. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $140,373 for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $109,914 for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $30,459, or 27.7%. The increase in cash used compared to the same period in the previous year is primarily due to increased commercialization activities as compared to the same period in 2006. The components of cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows: Net loss of $70,514, net of non cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $4,927, stock based compensation of $22,025 and the recognition of the remaining $5,343 of deferred revenue related to the termination of P&G agreement Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets of $80,578, primarily attributable to increases in inventories and accounts receivable. Due to the payment terms granted to our U.S. and European Union customers, a significant portion of our product sales to date have not yet been collected. These increases were offset by an increase in our accrued expenses for compensation and actual and estimated royalties. In 2008, changes in cash from operations will be highly dependent on sales levels, and related cash collections, from sales of Soliris. In addition, we expect that cash outflows related to the changes in operating assets will continue to increase related to sales and resulting accounts receivable increases and for purchases of additional inventory from our supply agreement with Lonza. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $3,458 for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $53,907 provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following: $39,306 cash inflow from the net sale of marketable securities, which was used to fund our operations 62 Table of Contents $68,484 of additions to property, plant and equipment, of which $62,575 was attributable to the construction of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs $32,636 of restricted cash used for costs incurred in connection with the construction and certain operating escrow balances of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility pursuant to the terms of our mortgage loan. In July 2006, we acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island for the future commercial production of Soliris, for manufacturing development and for manufacturing of future products. Since this date, we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full scale commercial manufacturing. We have also capitalized costs related to validation activities, including engineering runs, necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug. To date, these costs primarily include direct labor, materials and overhead related to the facility. We will begin depreciating the fixed assets related to the facility when the assets are substantially complete and ready for their intended use. Through December 31, 2007, we have capitalized $91,231 related to the facility, which includes all costs associated with construction, renovation and upgrades, engineering runs and capitalized interest. Through December 31, 2007, costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval, including engineering runs, was $21,999, and capitalized interest was $4,328. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $65,562 and $179,324 for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of $47,005 and $153,827, respectively and proceeds from the mortgage loan agreement with iStar of $18,000 and $26,000, respectively. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include our $150,000 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012, or 1.375% Notes, our $44,000 mortgage loan due August 2017 with a fixed annual interest rate of 9.12%, our annual payments of approximately $4,500 for operating and capital leases, principally for facilities and equipment, and an open letter of credit of $200 which serves as a security deposit on our facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. We also have contractual obligations related to our third party manufacturer and to other third parties. 63 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expecting to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable 150,000 150,000 Mortgage loan 44,020 4,890 11,740 27,390 Interest expense 33,800 6,200 12,200 9,300 6,100 Capital and operating leases 28,100 5,300 6,900 6,000 9,900 Total contractual obligations 255,920 11,500 23,990 177,040 43,390 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development 32,860 2,860 11,250 15,000 3,750 Licenses 2,500 700 900 600 300 Total commercial commitments 35,360 3,560 12,150 15,600 4,050 291,280 15,060 36,140 192,640 47,440 In addition to the above, we acquired from OMRF in February 2008 certain patents related to complement inhibition technology from Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, or OMRF. We will pay $10,000, plus interest, to OMRF for the rights to the patents, of which $7,500 will be remitted in 2008 and the remaining $2,500 in the first half of 2009. No further amounts, including royalties, will be owed to OMRF in respect of sales of Soliris or other use of the OMRF patents. Convertible Notes Payable We hold $150,000 principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012, or the 1.375% Notes. We pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2005. However, no principal payments are due until February 2012, except under certain circumstances such as liquidation, merger or business combination. The convertible notes payable do not have covenants related to our financial performance. The 1.375% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 31.7914 shares of common stock (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.46 per share) per $1 principal amount of the 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes. We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2007, the market value of our $150,000, 1.375% Convertible Notes due February 1, 2012, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $375,000. The $157,875 increase from December 31, 2006 is largely attributable to the increase in the price of our common stock during the period. 64 Table of Contents Mortgage Loan In July 2006, we entered into a mortgage loan agreement to borrow $26,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. In July 2007, we amended our existing mortgage loan agreement with iStar Financial Inc. to increase the loan amount by $18,000, resulting in an aggregate principal balance of $44,000. From the effective date of the amendment, the mortgage loan bears interest at a new fixed annual rate of 9.12%. The loan principal is required to be repaid in equal monthly instalments of $489, starting March 2010 and until August 2017, at which time all outstanding balances are due. The loan is collateralized by the assets of our Smithfield, RI manufacturing facility. The loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to July 2009. After that date the loan can be prepaid in whole, but not in part, and must include a prepayment premium as described in the loan agreement. As a condition of the loan, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts. These accounts must be used specifically for the purchase and construction of the manufacturing facility and maintain certain operating escrow balances. The lender has a first priority security interest and the right to approve all disbursements from the accounts holding restricted cash. Under the agreement, we are required to maintain a balance in the restricted cash accounts sufficient to complete the project. During 2007, a substantial portion of these disbursements were made, resulting in a restricted cash balance of $958. The mortgage loan does not require covenants related to our financial performance. Working Capital Loan In February 2008, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to provide for an available $25,000 revolving credit facility, that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The loan is collateralized by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries, but excluding intellectual property, assets of foreign subsidiaries and assets related to our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI. The borrowing base is limited to 80% of eligible domestic receivables, as defined. As of February 25, 2008, we have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect and (B) the Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, plus 0% to 0.25% depending on Alexions liquidity, as defined. Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on February 28, 2011, the maturity date. The revolving credit facility requires that Alexion comply with quarterly financial covenants related to liquidity and profitability ratios, as well as revenue. Further, the agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting Alexions ability and the ability of Alexions subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan. 65 Table of Contents Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2010. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The average interest rates on the above capital leases is 9.5% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We lease our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The lease, which had an initial term of ten years and six months, expiring in December 2010, was extended in August 2006 and revised again in June 2007. The lease is set to expire in May 2017. At this site, we lease a total of 125,424 square feet of space. In January 2003, we entered into a lease agreement for our pilot manufacturing plant and associated labs and offices in New Haven, Connecticut. The lease expired in October 2007. Pilot manufacturing operations have been transferred to our manufacturing facility located in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We lease additional research space in San Diego, California. In connection with the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies in 2006, we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease (see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K). In September 2007, the Company signed a sub lease for the AAT facility, which provides for sub lease payments through the term of the lease, or 2012. We believe our research and development facilities and pilot manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our current ongoing activities. Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG. Lonza Agreement We have a supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG relating to the manufacture of Soliris, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured. We are required to prepay certain amounts related to the production of Soliris, which are reflected as prepaid manufacturing costs. Once we take title to the inventory produced by Lonza, the amounts are reclassified into inventory. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans to proceed with production of Soliris by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements as well as the progress of our clinical development programs. In June 2007, we amended our supply agreement to provide for additional purchase commitments of Soliris of $30,000 to $35,000 through 2013. Such commitments may only be cancelled in limited circumstances. 66 Table of Contents We have agreed to purchase certain minimum quantities of product from Lonza under our existing arrangements. If we terminate the Lonza Agreement without cause, we will be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. Additional Commercial Commitments Additional payments, related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating up to approximately $1,745, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table. Income Taxes At December 31, 2007, we have available for Federal tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $732,653, which expire from 2008 through 2027. We also have federal and state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately $25,088, which expire from 2008 through 2027. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered. However, such limitation is not expected to result in the loss of the Federal net operating loss and research and development credit carry forwards. As a result, the net operating losses and tax credits are expected to significantly reduce cash payable for Federal income taxes in the United States for the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations, or SFAS 141(R), was issued. This standard will require an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration and all contractual contingencies, at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, the acquiring company is required to capitalize IPR&D and either amortize it over the life of the product, or write off if the project is abandoned or impaired. The Standard is effective for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2009. In February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including and Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, or SFAS 159, was issued. This standard permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. It also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements. This standard is effective January 1, 2008 for the Company. In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, or SFAS 157, was issued. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. This standard is effective January 1, 2008 for the Company. 67 Table of Contents We do not expect these Standards to have a material impact on our financial statements Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2007, we held approximately 90% of our cash and investments, including restricted cash, in financial instruments, primarily money market funds, with original maturity dates of three months or less. The remaining 10% is held in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than two years. These financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. However, we expect to hold time based investments, such as corporate bonds, through maturity. We estimate that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $11 in the fair value of our cash and investments, which had a weighted average duration of approximately 1 month at December 31, 2007. Our outstanding long term liabilities as of December 31, 2006 included our $150,000, 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012. As the notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be impacted by interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2006, the market value of our $150,000 1.375% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2012, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $217,125. In July 2006, we borrowed $26,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. In July 2007, we amended our existing mortgage loan agreement with iStar Financial Inc. to increase the loan amount by $18,000, resulting in an aggregate principal balance of $44,000. From the effective date of the amendment, the mortgage loan bears interest at a new fixed annual rate of 9.12%. Accordingly, any changes in the interest rate will not impact our Statement of Operations. During the first quarter of 2008, we entered into Credit Agreement with Bank of America and may borrow up to $25,000. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect and (B) the Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, plus 0% to 0.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). As of February 25, 2008, we have not borrowed any amounts related to this facility. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility. An effective increase or decrease of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. We do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item. Foreign Exchange Market Risk As a result of our European operations, we may face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily to the Euro. The current exposures arise primarily from monetary instruments, primarily accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. In 68 Table of Contents the future, we may elect to limit this exposure through hedging programs. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that the potential loss in fair value of our foreign currency exposure that would result from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates to be $1,265. In addition to our balance sheet risk, we have revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, future results may be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.
