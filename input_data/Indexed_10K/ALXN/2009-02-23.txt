Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, included at the beginning of this Form 10 K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and delivery of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states, including hematologic and neurologic diseases, transplant rejection, cancer and autoimmune disorders. Our marketed product Soliris&reg; (eculizumab) is the first therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic hematologic and neurological disorders, transplant rejection, and autoimmune disorders. Soliris is a humanized antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is a rare, debilitating and life threatening, acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine (hemoglobinuria). Since our incorporation in January 1992 until April 2007, we devoted most of our resources to drug discovery, research, and product and clinical development. In March 2007, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted marketing approval for Soliris. In the United States, Soliris is indicated for the treatment of all patients with PNH to reduce hemolysis. We began commercial sale of Soliris in the United States during April 2007. In June 2007, the European Commission, or E.C., approved the use of Soliris for patients with PNH in the European Union, which also serves as the basis for approval in Iceland and Norway. Subsequently, we engaged with appropriate authorities on the operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes that are separately required in each country and have initiated commercialization in those countries where this process was completed. In June 2007, the European Commission, or E.C., approved the use of Soliris for patients with PNH in the European Union, which also serves as the basis for approval in Iceland and Norway. Subsequently, we engaged with appropriate authorities on the operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes that are 54 Table of Contents separately required in each country and have initiated commercialization in those countries where this process is completed. In several countries outside the United States, we continued meaningful sales to individual patients through approved named patient programs during 2008. We have submitted an application for marketing authorization in Australia for Soliris for the treatment of patients with PNH. The application was accepted for priority review. Soliris has received Orphan Drug Designation in Australia, which provides certain regulatory and filing fee advantages, including market exclusivity for several years after approval subject to certain exceptions. We have also submitted applications for marketing authorization for Soliris in Canada and Switzerland for the treatment of patients with PNH. We were granted limited marketing authorization in Switzerland in September 2008 and approval in Canada in January 2009. We completed the 12 week AEGIS study of Japanese patients in October 2008. This study was a single registration study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacology of Soliris as a treatment for Japanese patients with PNH. The open label study was authorized by Japans Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency. Summary results were reported in December 2008. The pre specified primary efficacy endpoint of change in hemolysis was achieved with statistical significance and the drug appeared to be safe and well tolerated in study patients. We are also focusing our research efforts on the use of eculizumab as a treatment for patients with other rare and severe complement mediated conditions, including chronic hemolytic and thrombotic disorders, transplant rejection and chronic and debilitating neurological disorders. The FDA authorized our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for studying the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in treating myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune syndrome characterized by the failure of neuromuscular transmission, and we commenced clinical development in 2008. We are currently developing clinical programs to investigate the use of eculizumab as a treatment for patients with other complement mediated disorders, including three severe, life threatening, and rare hematologic disorders: atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a disease in which the lack of naturally occurring complement inhibitors can cause life threatening kidney damage; catastrophic anti phospholipid syndrome, a disorder in which uncontrollable blood clotting often leads to multiple organ failure; and cold agglutinin disease, an auto immune hemolytic anemia. The program for aHUS was initiated in January, 2009. Also, we completed a phase I/II proof of concept study of IV eculizumab in allergic asthmatic patients in the fourth quarter of 2008. We are aware that investigator initiated trials of eculizumab have begun in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a severe autoimmune neurologic disorder, and dense deposit disease, a severe kidney disease. We are also aware that independent investigators have commenced a study to evaluate eculizumab in organ transplantation. The FDA has also authorized our IND to evaluate the activity of an antibody to the immune regulator CD200 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, an incurable chronic cancer that results from expansion of B lymphocytes, and other blood tumors such as multiple myeloma. We commenced dosing of initial CLL patients with anti CD200 in the second quarter of 2008. In July 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The additional shares were distributed on August 22, 2008 to stockholders of record as of the close of trading on August 12, 2008. All share and per share data presented in this Form 10 K have been retroactively restated to reflect this stock split. 55 Table of Contents In October 2008, certain holders of our 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012, or 1.375% Notes, exercised conversion rights with respect to an aggregate principal amount of $52,778 of the 1.375% Notes resulting in the issuance of 3,356 shares of common stock. The shares were issued in November 2008. On December 31, 2008, the outstanding principal balance of the 1.375% Notes was $97,222. Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies: Revenue recognition Royalties Inventories Research and development expenses Stock based compensation Long lived assets Income taxes Revenue Recognition Net Product Sales Our principal source of revenue is product sales. We have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue: To date, our product sales have consisted solely of Soliris. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, which are primarily comprised of value added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in the Companys statements of operations, and do not impact net product sales. In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. In some cases, we also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors. 56 Table of Contents In addition to commercial sales, we have recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs outside the United States. The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales. We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid and programs in Europe, as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates, including estimates of customer mix, to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to nine months. Upon reconciliation of government reporting to our sales records, we revise our estimates of rebates payable, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment was made. Due to the limited number of rebate programs, the small number of patients treated with Soliris, the short period of time from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual rights of return, we are able to estimate rebates payable to third parties such that future adjustments are expected to be insignificant. We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the year ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 as follows: RebatesPayable Balance at December 31, 2006 $ Allowances for sales (1,024 ) Payments/credits made for sales 18 Balance at December 31, 2007 (1,006 ) Allowances for sales (4,308 ) Payments/credits made for sales 1,967 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ (3,347 ) Because of the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers generally carry limited inventory. We monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales are required related to inventory in our sales channels. To date, actual refunds and returns have been negligible. We also record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue. These costs are known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale. Deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts. Royalties Our cost of sales includes royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of Soliris. We estimate our royalty obligations based on existing contractual obligations and our assessment of estimated 57 Table of Contents royalties owed to other third parties. These estimates may be influenced by the outcome of unasserted claims and litigation, the results of which are uncertain (see Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements). On a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation, we may reassess these estimates, resulting in adjustments to cost of sales. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method. For products that are in initial clinical development, we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval, but subsequent to the filing of the Biologics License Application, or BLA, when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. Inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a Phase III clinical trial. We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property, plant and equipment prior to validation of the facility by the FDA. Once we receive approval by the FDA, the cost of the inventory will be reclassified from property, plant and equipment to inventory. We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may, after a period of time, no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, at which point we would adjust our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to fully realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory. The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements, based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write offs may be required. To date, we have not recorded any material adjustments to our inventory related to excess, expired or obsolete inventory. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply may result in write downs, which would be recorded as adjustments to cost of sales. Research and Development Expenses We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as 58 Table of Contents necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrolment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed. Stock Based Compensation We have one stock based compensation plan known as the 2004 Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of FAS 123(R), the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts. Long Lived Assets We assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important, and which could trigger an impairment review, include, among others, the following: a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset; and a significant decrease in market value of assets. If we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable, based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, such amount is recognized as an impairment charge. Other than the integration plan initiated with our subsidiary, Alexion Antibody Technologies, Inc., we have not experienced a significant triggering event and, therefore, have not recorded any impairment charges related to our long lived assets. To the extent we were to experience a triggering event, particularly as it relates to our largest long lived asset, the Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility, the resulting analysis may require an impairment charge to our statement of operations. 59 Table of Contents Income Taxes Despite achieving profitability in 2008, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our net operating losses (NOLs) and other deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions because we have an extended history of annual losses in these jurisdictions. Federal NOL carryforwards total approximately $745,000. During 2008, we reversed valuation allowances related to several foreign entities, based on an assessment of current and future profitability. On a quarterly basis, we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. We would consider reversing a significant portion of the valuation reserve upon assessment of certain factors, including: (i) a demonstration of sustained profitability; and (ii) the support of internal financial forecasts demonstrating the utilization of the NOLs prior to their expiration. If we determine that the reversal of the valuation reserves in these jurisdictions is appropriate, a significant one time benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of the reversal. In addition, the portion of our NOLs and income tax credits related to deductions for employee stock options will be credited to additional paid in capital if and when realized. At such time, we will also commence recognizing an income tax provision at our effective tax rate. However, our ability to utilize our NOLs and credits to offset taxable income will continue to provide us with cash savings until the NOLs and credits are fully utilized or expire. The NOLs and credits remain subject to examination by Federal and state authorities due to their carried forward position. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48 1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, or FSP FIN 48 1, effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. Adjustments may be made to these estimates as a result of events such as resolution of tax audits or lapsing of statutory audit periods. We will also refine these estimates over time as our operations mature and as we gain more experience operating as a taxpayer on a worldwide basis. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our tax provision, and related effective tax rate, recorded in our statement of operations could be materially impacted. 60 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: Net product sales $ 259,004 $ 66,381 $ Contract research revenue 95 5,660 1,458 Other revenue 100 Total revenues 259,099 72,041 1,558 Cost of sales 28,366 6,696 Research and development expenses: 62,581 68,961 83,225 Selling, general and administrative 133,543 96,142 55,418 Total operating expenses 196,124 165,103 138,643 Operating income (loss) 34,609 (99,758 ) (137,085 ) Other income (expense): Investment income 2,810 8,080 8,076 Interest expense (2,407 ) (2,489 ) (2,837 ) Foreign currency gain (loss) (282 ) 1,132 (41 ) Income tax provision (benefit) 1,581 (745 ) (373 ) Net income (loss) $ 33,149 $ (92,290 ) $ (131,514 ) Earnings (loss) per common share: Basic $ 0.43 $ (1.27 ) $ (2.07 ) Diluted $ 0.39 $ (1.27 ) $ (2.07 ) 61 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $113,204 and commercial and named patient sales outside the United States of $145,800. Included in revenue from outside the United States, we have recorded a gain of $4,141 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $46,196 and commercial and named patient sales in the European Union of $20,185. In March 2007, the FDA granted approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH. In June 2007, the E.C. also approved Soliris for the treatment of PNH. Our product sales have been solely attributable to sales of Soliris and have been generated from three sources: commercial sales in the United States (beginning in the second quarter of 2007), named patient sales prior to full scale commercialization in certain countries outside the United States (beginning in the first quarter of 2007) and commercial sales in countries outside the United States (beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007). The increases in revenue for fiscal year 2008 versus 2007 were due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris as a result of our product launch in the United States and in various countries in Europe. As additional physicians request Soliris for their patients with PNH and obtain governmental reimbursement, we expect that the number of patients receiving Soliris treatments will increase, resulting in an increase in product sales in existing countries. We also expect product sales in the rest of the world to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the regulatory, price approval and reimbursement process in additional territories. We recorded contract research revenues of $95 and $5,660 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the $5,660 in contract research revenues recorded in 2007, $5,343 relates to the termination of our collaborative agreement with Proctor & Gamble, effective March 30, 2007. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $28,366 and $6,696 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris, as well as other manufacturing costs. Changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. Product sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our BLA and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory. Beginning in 2008, our cost of sales reflected the full manufacturing cost of the inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a patent license agreement and settlement agreement with PDL BioPharma in which we are obligated to pay a total of $25,000 for a fully paid, perpetual license. As a result of the settlement and evaluation of other potential royalties, we recorded a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately $1,800 related to an adjustment of estimated accrued royalties for sales of Soliris prior to the fourth quarter. We further expect that this settlement will have a favorable impact of our future cost of goods sold. 62 Table of Contents On a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation, we may reassess the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expense includes personnel, facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, as well as product development costs. We group our research and development expenses into two major categories: external direct expenses and all other R&D expenses. External direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development, product development and discovery research. Clinical costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to Soliris and other product candidates. Product development costs, which historically relate primarily to Soliris, are those incurred in performing duties related to pre and post approval manufacturing development and regulatory functions. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of Soliris and other product candidates. Clinical costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated. All other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program. The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Year EndedDecember 31,2007 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 16,803 $ 17,294 $ (491 ) 2.8 % Product development 10,519 11,944 (1,425 ) 11.9 % Discovery research 1,201 2,801 (1,600 ) 57.1 % Total external direct expenses 28,523 32,039 (3,516 ) 11.0 % Payroll and benefits 26,380 29,634 (3,254 ) 11.0 % Operating and occupancy 4,192 4,615 (423 ) 9.2 % Depreciation and amortization 3,486 2,673 813 30.4 % Total other R&D expenses 34,058 36,922 (2,864 ) 7.8 % Research and development expense $ 62,581 $ 68,961 $ (6,380 ) 9.3 % 63 Table of Contents The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Year EndedDecember 31,2007 Year EndedDecember 31,2006 AccumulatedExpendituressinceJanuary 1, 2006 External direct expenses Soliris: PNH program $ 13,564 $ 14,084 $ 16,901 $ 44,549 Soliris: non PNH programs 1,167 521 1,688 CD200 program 458 458 Pexelizumab 1,847 11,866 13,713 Other 1,614 842 3,495 5,951 $ 16,803 $ 17,294 $ 32,262 $ 66,359 Previous to January 1, 2006, we have spent approximately $475,838 on all research & development programs. Substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended December 31, 2006 were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of PNH in 2007 in the United States and European Union, and ceased development of pexelizumab in 2006. The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. A large portion of our annual expenses relates to commercialization of Soliris and general and administrative costs. We may not have or be able to raise the necessary capital to support both the commercialization of Soliris as well as each of our development programs through and until commercialization. Further, we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to the Risk Factors in this Form 10 K, including the risk factors set forth on page 30 (If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue the commercialization of Soliris or continue to complete our product development), page 25 (None of our product candidates except for Soliris has received regulatory approvals), page 25 (Completion of pre clinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development) and page 26 (There are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated). During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred research and development expenses of $62,581, a decrease of $6,380, or 9.3% versus the $68,961 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Decrease of $3,254 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to a reduction in stock based compensation due to employee forfeitures and additional capitalization to inventory and property, plant and equipment. Increase of $813 in depreciation and amortization related primarily to the amortization of costs associated with our new pilot plant located at our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter 2007. 64 Table of Contents Decrease of $1,600 in discovery research was primarily due to a reduction in external research and consulting fees. Decrease of $1,425 in product development expenses due to increased manufacturing and plant readiness activities including a decrease of approximately $925 relating to additional capitalization of costs associated with the validation of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2009 due to clinical trials, manufacturing costs and research related to eculizumab and anti CD200 development programs. For additional information on these programs, please refer to Product and Development Programs in Item I of this Form 10 K. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $133,543, an increase of $37,401 or 38.9% versus the $96,142 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2008, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $66,856, an increase of $17,335, or 35%, versus $49,521 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $17,211 related to our global commercial operations teams. Other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive, finance, information technology, human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity. Increase in non labor commercial operations of $14,746 for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the expansion of our foreign operations, which we expanded significantly in the latter half of 2007. Increase in non labor general and administration of $5,977 primarily related to increases in legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity. Decrease in non labor information technology of $1,293 primarily related to the costs associated with the build out of our European operations in 2007. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2009, reflecting the additional growth of our organizational structure in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Other Income (Expense) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $282 of foreign currency loss, a decrease of $1,414, or 124.9%, versus a gain of $1,132 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The decreased impact of foreign currency fluctuations was due to our hedging programs implemented in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, investment income decreased $5,270, or 65.2% to $2,810 due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds. During the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense of $2,407 was consistent with the amounts recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007. 65 Table of Contents Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax provision of $1,581, compared to an income tax benefit of $745 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The tax expense during 2008 is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in these foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of research tax credits for cash. The income tax benefit for 2007 is attributable to the exchange of research tax credits for cash. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets as realizability of those assets is uncertain. During 2009, we will continue to monitor our deferred tax assets in order to assess whether adjustments related to our valuation allowance may be required. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $46,196 and commercial and named patient sales in the European Union of $20,185. Because our commercial and pre approval sales programs did not begin until 2007, there were no sales of Soliris for the year ended December 31, 2006. We recorded contract research revenues of $5,660 and $1,458 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contract research revenues reflect the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from P&G under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab and U.S. government funded research grant revenue for our asthma program. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in contract research revenue, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, was due to the termination of our collaborative agreement with P&G. Effective March 30, 2007, we and P&G agreed to terminate our 1999 collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab. As the agreement has been terminated, the remaining portion of the $10,000 non refundable upfront license fee, or $5,343, was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2007. Due to the termination of the P&G agreement, we expect that future contract research revenue will be dependent upon future awards or grants. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the decrease in U.S. government grants, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the conclusion of the anthrax program in 2006. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $6,696 for the year ended December 31, 2007. There was no cost of sales incurred for periods prior to December 31, 2006. Cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris, as well as other manufacturing costs. Changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. Product sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our BLA, and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory. 66 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2007 Year EndedDecember 31,2006 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 17,294 $ 32,262 $ (14,968 ) 46 % Product development 11,944 8,035 3,909 49 % Discovery research 2,801 4,973 (2,172 ) 44 % Total external direct expenses 32,039 45,270 (13,231 ) 29 % Payroll and benefits 29,634 30,061 (427 ) 1 % Operating and occupancy 4,615 5,520 (905 ) 16 % Depreciation and amortization 2,673 2,374 299 13 % Total other R&D expenses 36,922 37,955 (1,033 ) 3 % Research and development expense $ 68,961 $ 83,225 $ (14,264 ) 17 % During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred research and development expenses of $68,961, a decrease of $14,264, or 17.1% versus the $83,225 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to, and offset, by the following: Decrease of $14,968 in clinical development expense due largely to decreases in spending for pexelizumab program of $10,022, the reduction or completion of eculizumab programs, including TRIUMPH, SHEPHERD and EXTENSION clinical trials and incurrence of 2006 costs in association with filing the BLA of $7,516. These decreases were offset by increases of $7,850 related to new programs in 2007, including EXPLORE and EMBRACE clinical trials and the PNH registry. Increase of $3,909 in product development expenses due to an increase of $5,518 related to expenditures for drug development, quality assurance, scientific communications and regulatory affairs due to the regulatory approvals in both the United States (March 2007) and the European Union (June 2007). The increase was offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of $1,622 related to the capitalization of inventory costs beginning with filing of the BLA in September 2006. Prior to September 2006, we expensed all manufacturing costs, resulting in lower 2007 expenses compared to 2006. Decrease of $2,172 in discovery research was primarily due to the closure of AAT operations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $96,142, an increase of $41,263 or 75.2% versus the $55,418 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2007, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $49,521, an increase of $21,863, or 79.0%, versus $27,658 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $18,250 related to our global commercial operations teams. Other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive, finance, information technology, human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity. 67 Table of Contents Increase in non labor commercial operations of $14,087 for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, this increase was comprised primarily of increases in advertising and promotion of Soliris related to the April 2007 commercial launch in the United States and market research related to approval of Soliris in the European Union, as well as promotion of Soliris for commercial launches in certain European countries. Increase in non labor general and administration and information technology of $3,862 for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity. Other Income (Expense) During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $1,132 of foreign currency gain. There was no foreign currency gain (loss) recorded in 2006. As a result of our European operations, we have exposure, primarily from accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to the Euro. During the year ended December 31, 2007, investment income and interest expense were consistent with the results recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an income tax benefit of $745, compared to $373 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the tax benefit was attributable to an increase in the estimated cash exchange of a state incremental research and development tax credit. Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data) As of December 31, 2008, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $139,711. The $32,999 increase from December 31, 2007 is largely attributable to the significantly increased sales and the resulting collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from employee option exercises, offset by payments for our patent purchase from OMRF and investments in inventory and our Smithfield, Rhode Island facility. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial, corporate and U.S. Government notes in accordance with our investment policy. We do not have any investments in auction rate securities. As of December 31, 2008, $619 of cash was restricted to be used for the construction and other costs related to our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. An additional $1,100 is restricted as part of a leasehold deposit for office space. Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts. Substantially all cash equivalents are held in a single AAA rated institutional money market fund that participates in the U.S. Department of Treasurys Temporary Guarantee Program for money market funds. At December 31, 2008, two individual customers accounted for 20.3% and 20.0% of the accounts receivable balance. For the period ended December 31, 2008, one customer accounted for 21.0% of our product sales. 68 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, we have foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $128,876. These outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a fair value of $5,409, which is included in other current assets. The counterparty to these forward contracts is a large multinational commercial bank, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material. However, we can not be assured that the financial institution will not be further impacted by the negative economic environment. At December 31, 2008, our working capital was $192,683, compared to $167,645 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, our current ratio was 3.28, compared to 5.45 at December 31, 2007. The decrease in current ratio relates primarily to the $25,000 license payable owed to PDL BioPharma. We anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash, as well as interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities, should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twelve months. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $53,199 for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus $139,614 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. The change is primarily due to the net income achieved in 2008 versus the net loss as compared to the same period in 2007. The components of cash provided by operating activities for the period ended December 31, 2008 are as follows: Our reported net income, plus non cash items, including depreciation and amortization, unrealized currency gain, unrealized hedge gains, unrealized pension losses and stock compensation, of $64,959. Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets of $46,011, primarily attributable to increases in inventories and accounts receivable, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $32,912. The growth in our sales of Soliris has required substantial investments in working capital items such as inventories and accounts receivable. In 2009, we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections, from Soliris. In addition, we expect that cash outflows related to the changes in operating assets will continue to increase related to sales and resulting accounts receivable increases. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $38,650 for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus $3,077 provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following: Cash inflow from the net sale of marketable securities of $9,368, which was used to fund our operations Additions to property, plant and equipment of $39,733, of which $25,180 was attributable to the construction of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs Outflow of $7,500 for the purchase of patents from OMRF and $1,124 for the purchase of a license in association with the acquisition of Legend K.K. 69 Table of Contents In July 2006, we acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island for the future commercial production of Soliris, for manufacturing development and for manufacturing of future products. Since this date, we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full scale commercial manufacturing. We have also capitalized costs related to validation activities, including engineering runs, necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug. To date, these costs primarily include direct labor, materials, overhead and pre validation inventory related to the facility. We will begin depreciating the fixed assets related to the facility when the assets are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which will occur upon the regulatory approval of the plant for production of commercial quantities of eculizumab. Through December 31, 2008, we have capitalized $116,364 related to the facility, which includes all costs associated with construction, renovation and upgrades, engineering runs and capitalized interest. Through December 31, 2008, costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval, including engineering runs, was $42,416, and capitalized interest was $9,045. We expect to continue to incur costs related to the validation process through the end of the 2009. At such point that we receive regulatory approval, we will cease capitalizing costs into property, plant and equipment Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $28,308 and $64,844 for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of $28,893 and $47,005, respectively, and proceeds from the mortgage loan agreement with iStar of $18,000 in 2007. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include our $97,222, 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012, or 1.375% Notes, our $44,000 mortgage loan due August 2017 with a fixed annual interest rate of 9.12%, a $25,000 license payable owed to PDL BioPharma and our annual payments of approximately $4,500 for operating and capital leases, principally for facilities and equipment. We also have contractual obligations related to our third party manufacturer and to certain other third parties described below, as well as open letters of credit totaling $4,165. 70 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable $ 97,222 $ $ $ 97,222 $ Mortgage loan 44,000 10,756 11,734 21,510 Interest expense 24,971 5,428 9,980 5,812 3,751 Capital and operating leases 26,771 5,055 7,961 5,702 8,053 Total contractual obligations $ 192,964 $ 10,483 $ 28,697 $ 120,470 $ 33,314 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development $ 30,000 $ 3,750 $ 15,000 $ 11,250 $ Licenses 28,890 27,900 395 400 195 Total commercial commitments $ 58,890 $ 31,650 $ 15,395 $ 11,650 $ 195 The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described under the Risk Factors. The table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of $9,569 at December 31, 2008. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2008. We do not expect a settlement within the next twelve months. Convertible Notes We hold $97,222 principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012, or the 1.375% Notes. We pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2005. However, no principal payments are due until February 2012, except under certain circumstances such as liquidation, merger or business combination. The convertible notes payable do not contain covenants related to our financial performance. In October 2008, certain holders of our 1.375% Notes exercised conversion rights with respect to an aggregate principal amount of $52,778 of the 1.375% Notes resulting in the issuance of 3,356 shares of common stock. The shares were issued in November 2008. The 1.375% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 63.5828 shares of common stock (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $15.73 per share) per $1 principal amount of the 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes. We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. The conversion rate and conversion price have been adjusted for the stock split effected on August 22, 2008. 71 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the market value of our $97,222, 1.375% Convertible Notes due February 1, 2012, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $211,106 versus $375,000 at December 31, 2007. The decrease of $163,894 from December 31, 2007 is largely attributable to the conversion of $52,778 of principal value of the Notes in October 2008. Mortgage Loan We have a mortgage loan of $44,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.12%. The loan principal is required to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $489, starting March 2010 and until August 2017, at which time all outstanding balances are due. The loan is collateralized by the assets of our Smithfield, RI manufacturing facility. The loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to July 2009. After that date, the loan can be prepaid in whole, but not in part, and must include a prepayment premium as described in the loan agreement. As a condition of the loan, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts. These accounts must maintain certain operating escrow balances. At December 31, 2008, the balance of restricted cash was $619. The mortgage loan does not contain covenants related to our financial performance. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2008, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to provide for an available $25,000 revolving credit facility that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The loan is collateralized by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries, but excluding intellectual property, assets of foreign subsidiaries and assets related to our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI. The borrowing base is limited to the lesser of $25,000 or 80% of eligible domestic receivables. At December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect and (B) the Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, plus an additional 0% to 0.25% depending on Alexions liquidity. Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on February 28, 2011, the maturity date. The revolving credit facility requires that we comply with quarterly financial covenants related to liquidity and profitability ratios, as well as minimum revenue requirements. Further, the agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan. 72 Table of Contents Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2010. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The average interest rates on the above capital leases is 9.47% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We lease 125,424 square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut. The lease is set to expire in May 2017. We lease additional research space in San Diego, California. In connection with the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies in 2006, we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease (see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K). In September 2007, the Company signed a sub lease for the AAT facility, which provides for sub lease payments through the term of the lease, or 2012. We believe our research and development facilities and pilot manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, provides adequate space for our current requirements. Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG. Lonza Agreement We have a supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG relating to the manufacture of Soliris, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans to proceed with production of Soliris by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the status of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. We have agreed to purchase certain minimum quantities of product from Lonza under our existing arrangements. If we terminate the Lonza Agreement without cause, we will be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. License and Patent Rights In February 2008, we agreed to acquire certain patents related to complement inhibition technology from Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, or OMRF, for $10,000. In addition to the initial payment of $3,000 paid in February 2008 and the $4,500 paid in December 2008, a final payment of $2,500 is due during or prior to 73 Table of Contents July 2009. No further amounts, including royalties, will be owed to OMRF in respect of sales of Soliris or other use of the OMRF patents. In December 2008, we entered into a definitive license agreement with PDL BioPharma, Inc. with respect to certain patents relating to the humanization of antibodies for $25,000. The initial payment of $12,500 was paid in January 2009, with a final payment of $12,500 due by June 30, 2009. No additional payments will be owed by Alexion to PDL under such patents in respect of Soliris sales for any indication. Additional Commercial Commitments Additional payments, related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating up to approximately $1,795, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table. Income Taxes At December 31, 2008, we have pre tax federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $745,102, $713,040, and $20,310, respectively. These NOLs expire between 2009 and 2027. We also have federal and state research and development income tax credit carryforwards of approximately $18,826 and $8,834 respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2009 and 2027. Due to the amount of our NOLs and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes in the foreseeable future. We do expect to pay cash taxes in a number of foreign jurisdictions, as well as certain states, where our net operating losses were fully utilized during 2008. We were subject to the alternative minimum tax during 2008 and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. However, we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any of our federal NOLs. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). This statement is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) as well as related hedged items, bifurcated derivatives, and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments. Entities with instruments subject to SFAS 161 must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures. SFAS 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the disclosure implications of this statement, and we expect to include expanded disclosures of our derivative instruments as a result of the adoption of SFAS 161. 74 Table of Contents In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). The objective of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141(R), and other U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This FSP applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise and shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years and applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited. We have evaluated the new statement and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2008, we held all of our cash equivalents and investments in money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less. Our outstanding long term liabilities as of December 31, 2008 included our $97,222, 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012. As the notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be impacted by interest rate changes. In July 2006, we borrowed $26,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. In July 2007, we amended the mortgage loan agreement with iStar Financial Inc. to increase the loan amount by $18,000, resulting in an aggregate principal balance of $44,000. From the effective date of the amendment, the mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.12%. Accordingly, any changes in the interest rate will not impact our financial statements. During the first quarter of 2008, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America and may borrow up to $25,000. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 75 Table of Contents (i) LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect and (B) the Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, plus 0% to 0.25% depending on Alexions liquidity (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). We do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements. In conjunction with the purchase of patents from OMRF, we agreed to pay an aggregate principal amount of $7,000, representing the balance of the $10,000 purchase price for the OMRF patent rights. Interest shall accrue on any unpaid amount at the rate of 50% of the sum of the prime rate (as published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal (New York edition) plus 1%, per annum. We do not expect changes in interest rates related to this payable to have a material effect on our financial statements. Foreign Exchange Market Risk As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro and British Pound. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2008, we began a program to limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2008, we commenced a program to hedge a portion of our forecasted product sales to mitigate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Both programs utilize forward foreign exchange contracts intended to reduce, not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $128,876. As of December 31, 2008, our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a fair value of $5,409, which is included in other current assets/liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The counterparty to these forward contracts is a multinational commercial bank. The Company believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material. Since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities, we do not expect that a hypothetical 10% adverse change fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets, which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our forward contracts. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales. 76 Table of Contents
