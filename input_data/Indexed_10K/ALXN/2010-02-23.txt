Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, included at the beginning of this Form 10 K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states, including hematologic, kidney and neurologic diseases, transplant rejection, cancer and autoimmune disorders. Our marketed product Soliris&reg; (eculizumab) is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic hematologic, kidney and neurological disorders, transplant rejection, and autoimmune disorders. Soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is a rare, debilitating and life threatening, acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine (hemoglobinuria). Soliris was granted marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and by the European Commission, or E.C., in 2007 and now has received approval in several other countries throughout the world. Additionally, Soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories. In 2009, the FDA and E.C. granted Soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, or aHUS, a rare, inherited, and life threatening complement inhibitor deficiency disease that often progresses to end stage kidney disease or failure. Alexion is currently enrolling patients in four clinical studies of Soliris as an investigational treatment for adolescent and adult patients with aHUS. Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under accounting 49 principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition Royalties Inventories Research and development expenses Stock based compensation Income taxes Revenue Recognition Net Product Sales Our principal source of revenue is product sales. We have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue: To date, our product sales have consisted solely of Soliris. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, which are primarily comprised of value added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in the Companys statements of operations, and do not impact net product sales. In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. In some cases, we also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors. In addition to sales where Soliris is commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs outside the United States. The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales. Because of the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers generally carry limited inventory. We monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales is required. To date, actual refunds and returns have been negligible. We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid and programs in Europe, as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates, including estimates of customer mix, to determine which sales will be subject to 50 rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months. Upon review of historical rebate payments compared to our accruals, we revise our estimates of rebates payable, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 as follows: RebatesPayable Balance at December 31, 2006 $ Current provisions relating to sales in current year (1,024 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 18 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ (1,006 ) Current provisions relating to sales in current year (3,723 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 1,189 Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years 193 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ (3,347 ) Current provisions relating to sales in current year (6,024 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 2,165 Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years 3,138 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ (4,068 ) We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue. These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale. Royalties Our cost of sales includes royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of Soliris. We estimate our royalty obligations based on existing contractual obligations and our assessment of estimated royalties owed to other third parties. These estimates may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims, if any, the results of which are uncertain. On a periodic basis and based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess these estimates, resulting in adjustments to cost of sales. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method. For products that are in initial clinical development, we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval, but subsequent to the filing of the Biologics License Application, or BLA, when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. Inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a Phase III 51 clinical trial. We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property, plant and equipment prior to approval of the facility by regulatory authorities. We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may, after a period of time, no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, at which point we would adjust our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory. The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write offs may be required. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels, which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales. Research and Development Expenses We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed. Stock Based Compensation We have one stock based compensation plan known as the 2004 Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until 52 exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reversed the valuation allowance recorded against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the United States, resulting in a tax benefit of $215,516. The decision to reverse the valuation allowance was made after management determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized. We made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability, as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where realizability is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period. 53 Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: Net product sales $ 386,800 $ 259,004 $ 66,381 Contract research revenue 95 5,660 Total revenues 386,800 259,099 72,041 Cost of sales 45,059 28,366 6,696 Research and development expenses 81,915 62,581 68,961 Selling, general and administrative expenses 172,767 133,543 96,142 Total operating expenses 254,682 196,124 165,103 Operating income (loss) 87,059 34,609 (99,758 ) Other income (expense) (3,745 ) 121 6,723 Income (loss) before income taxes 83,314 34,730 (93,035 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (211,852 ) 1,581 (745 ) Net income (loss) $ 295,166 $ 33,149 $ (92,290 ) Earnings (loss) per common share: Basic $ 3.46 $ 0.43 $ (1.27 ) Diluted $ 3.26 $ 0.39 $ (1.27 ) 54 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009 to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded sales of Soliris in the United States of $159,829 and outside the United States of $226,971. We recorded a gain of $3,363 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, included in revenue from outside the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded sales of Soliris in the United States of $113,204 and outside the United States of $145,800. We recorded a gain of $4,141 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, included in revenue from outside the United States. The increases in revenue for fiscal year 2009 versus 2008 were due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris in the United States and outside the United States. As additional physicians request Soliris and as governmental reimbursement for Soliris is provided for in more territories, we expect that the number of patients receiving Soliris treatment will increase, resulting in an increase in product sales in existing countries. We also expect product sales in the rest of the world to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the regulatory, price approval and reimbursement process in additional territories. We recorded no contract research revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009 and $95 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $45,059 and $28,366, or 12% and 11% of product revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris. On a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation, we may reassess the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expense includes personnel, facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, as well as product development costs. We group our research and development expenses into two major categories: external direct expenses and all other R&D expenses. External direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development, product development and discovery research. Clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates. Product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to pre and post approval manufacturing development and regulatory functions. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for 55 other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates. Clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated. All other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program. The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Year EndedDecember 31,2008 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 20,858 $ 17,889 $ 2,969 17 % Product development 10,630 8,258 2,372 29 % Discovery research 1,776 1,201 575 48 % Total external direct expenses 33,264 27,348 5,916 22 % Labor expenses 39,899 27,555 12,344 45 % Operating and occupancy 4,935 4,192 743 18 % Depreciation and amortization 3,817 3,486 331 9 % Total other R&D expenses 48,651 35,233 13,418 38 % Research and development expense $ 81,915 $ 62,581 $ 19,334 31 % The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Year EndedDecember 31,2007 AccumulatedExpendituressince January 1,2006 External direct expenses Soliris: PNH program $ 7,850 $ 14,112 $ 14,741 $ 53,604 Soliris: non PNH programs 8,938 1,657 679 11,274 Samalizumab 1,222 699 1,921 Pexelizumab 1,847 13,713 Unallocated 2,848 1,421 2,667 10,431 $ 20,858 $ 17,889 $ 19,934 $ 90,943 Prior to January 1, 2006, we spent approximately $475,838 on all research & development programs. Substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended December 31, 2006 were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of PNH in 2007 in the United States and European Union, and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in 2006. Expenses for the pexelizumab program recorded in 2007 related to the termination of the program. 56 The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to the Risk Factors in this Form 10 K. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred research and development expenses of $81,915, an increase of $19,334, or 31% versus the $62,581 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increase of $12,344 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our expanding number of clinical programs and manufacturing and product development activities at our production facility in Smithfield RI. Increase of $2,969 external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, as well as growth of our samalizumab program, offset by decreases in spending on the PNH program (see table above). Increase of $2,372 in external product development expenses related primarily to increases in manufacturing development activities at our production facility in Smithfield RI. We expect our research and development expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2010 due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding eculizumab and samalizumab development programs. For additional information on these programs, please refer to Product and Development Programs in Item I of this Form 10 K. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel, corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products. These selling, general and administrative costs include: corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation; marketing and sales operations in support of Soliris; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and support personnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit and legal expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $172,767, an increase of $39,224, or 29%, versus the $133,543 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2009, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $88,622, an increase of $21,766, or 33%, versus $66,856 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $15,108 related to our global commercial operations teams. Other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive, finance, information technology, human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity. Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $17,458 was due primarily to increases in marketing and consulting services of $5,693, travel costs of $3,006, occupancy and 57 depreciation expenses of $4,901 relating to new and expanded office space in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Latin America and $1,348 in telecommunications and information technology expenses. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2010, reflecting our growth as a commercial organization throughout the world. Other Income (Expense) During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $530 of foreign currency loss, an increase of $248, versus a loss of $282 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, investment income decreased $2,024, or 72% to $786 due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds. During the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $1,801, or 75%, to $606 due primarily to lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversion in October 2008 and exchange in April and May 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $1,801, or 75%, to $606 due primarily to lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversion in October 2008 and exchange in April and May 2009. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $211,852, compared to a provision of $1,581 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The tax benefit reported in 2009 includes a benefit of $215,516 attributable to the release of valuation allowances against US deferred tax assets, offset principally by income tax provisions for profitable foreign subsidiaries. The valuation allowance was reversed after management determined that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets relating to the United States would be realized. We made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability, as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits. The income tax provision for 2008 is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in those foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of Federal research credits for cash. Due to reversal of the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2009, we will record income taxes at an effective tax rate, starting in 2010, which is significantly higher than historical tax rates. The Company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland effective January 1, 2010, with a final expiration date in 2019. The tax holiday will exempt the Company from most local corporate income taxes in Switzerland through the end of 2014 and is expected to be renewed for an additional 5 years. 58 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenues During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $113,204 and commercial and named patient sales outside the United States of $145,800. We recorded a gain of $4,141 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, included in revenue from outside the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded sales of Soliris related to commercial sales in the United States of $46,196 and commercial and named patient sales in the European Union of $20,185. The increases in revenue for fiscal year 2008 versus 2007 were due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris as a result of our product launch in the United States and in various countries in Europe. We recorded contract research revenues of $95 and $5,660 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the $5,660 in contract research revenues recorded in 2007, $5,343 relates to the termination of our collaborative agreement with Proctor & Gamble, effective March 30, 2007. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $28,366 and $6,696 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris, as well as other manufacturing costs. Changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods. Product sold during the year ended December 31, 2007 included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our BLA and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory. Beginning in 2008, our cost of sales reflected the full manufacturing cost of the inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a patent license agreement and settlement agreement with PDL BioPharma in which we were obligated to pay a total of $25,000 for a fully paid, perpetual license. As a result of the settlement and evaluation of other potential royalties, we recorded a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately $1,800 related to an adjustment of estimated accrued royalties for sales of Soliris prior to the fourth quarter. 59 Research and Development Expenses The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Year EndedDecember 31,2007 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 17,889 $ 19,934 $ (2,045 ) 10 % Product development 8,258 8,651 (393 ) 5 % Discovery research 1,201 2,801 (1,600 ) 57 % Total external direct expenses 27,348 31,386 (4,038 ) 13 % Payroll and benefits 27,555 30,287 (2,732 ) 9 % Operating and occupancy 4,192 4,615 (423 ) 9 % Depreciation and amortization 3,486 2,673 813 30 % Total other R&D expenses 35,233 37,575 (2,342 ) 6 % Research and development expense $ 62,581 $ 68,961 $ (6,380 ) 9 % The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Year EndedDecember 31,2007 External direct expenses Soliris: PNH program $ 14,112 $ 14,741 Soliris: non PNH programs 1,657 679 Samalizumab 699 Pexelizumab 1,847 Unallocated 1,421 2,667 $ 17,889 $ 19,934 During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred research and development expenses of $62,581, a decrease of $6,380, or 9.3% versus the $68,961 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Decrease of $2,732 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to a reduction in stock based compensation due to employee forfeitures and additional capitalization to inventory and property, plant and equipment. Decrease of $2,045 external clinical development expenses related primarily to termination of our pexelizumab program in 2007 and decreases in spending for Soliris for PNH. These are offset by the expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, as well as growth of our samalizumab program (see table above). Decrease of $1,600 in discovery research was primarily due to a reduction in external research and consulting fees. 60 Increase of $813 in depreciation and amortization related primarily to the amortization of costs associated with our new pilot plant located at our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter 2007. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $133,543, an increase of $37,401 or 38.9% versus the $96,142 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2008, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $66,856, an increase of $17,335, or 35%, versus $49,521 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $17,211 related to our global commercial operations teams. Other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive, finance, information technology, human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity. Increase in non labor commercial operations of $14,746 for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the expansion of our foreign operations, which we expanded significantly in the latter half of 2007. Increase in non labor general and administration of $5,977 primarily related to increases in legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity. Decrease in non labor information technology of $1,293 primarily related to the costs associated with the build out of our European operations in 2007. Other Income (Expense) During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $282 of foreign currency loss, versus a gain of $1,132 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. The decreased impact of foreign currency fluctuations was due to our hedging programs implemented in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, investment income decreased $5,270, or 65.2% to $2,810 due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds. During the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense of $2,407 was consistent with the amounts recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax provision of $1,581, compared to an income tax benefit of $745 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The tax expense during 2008 is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in these foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of federal research tax credits for cash. The income tax benefit for 2007 is attributable to the exchange of state research tax credits for cash. 61 Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data) As of December 31, 2009, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $176,220. The $38,208 increase from December 31, 2008 is largely attributable to the significantly increased sales and the resulting collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from employee option exercises, offset by payments against our mortgage loan of $44,000, payments related to the PDL settlement of $25,000 and OMRF patent purchase agreement of $2,500 and capital expenditures associated with validation and regulatory approval of our Smithfield, Rhode Island facility. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial, corporate and U.S. Government notes in accordance with our investment policy. Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, corporate bonds, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts. At December 31, 2009, one individual customer accounted for 20% of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2009, we have foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $284,895. These outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a net fair value of $2,528, of which an unrealized gain of $5,209 is included in other current assets, $2,061 is included in other assets and an unrealized loss of $4,742 is included in other current liabilities. The counterparty to these forward contracts is a large multinational commercial bank, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material. However, we can not be assured that the financial institution will not be further impacted by the negative economic environment. In January 2010, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to, among other things, increase our revolving credit facility by $25,000. The amended agreement provides for a $50,000 revolving credit facility, with up to a $20,000 sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the facility to $75,000 in accordance with its terms. At December 31, 2009, our working capital was $288,194, compared to $192,683 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, our current ratio was 4.38, compared to 3.28 at December 31, 2008. The increase in current ratio relates primarily to increases in our accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents as well as reductions in amounts payable to PDL and OMRF. We anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twelve months. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $113,841 for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus $53,199 provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is primarily due to the increase in pre tax income achieved in 2009 versus the same period in 2008. The components of cash provided by operating activities, as reported in our Statement of Cash Flows, for the period ended December 31, 2009 are as follows: Our reported net income, adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non cash debt exchange expense, unrealized currency gain, unrealized hedge gains, deferred taxes and stock compensation, was $128,080 for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus $64,959 for the year ended December 31, 2008. 62 Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $14,239, primarily relates to increases in accounts receivable of $36,440, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $14,131 and a decrease in inventory of $14,596. In 2010, we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections, from Soliris. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $81,423 for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus $38,650 used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following: Additions to property, plant and equipment of $35,275, of which $20,900 was attributable to expenditures related to our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs. Final payments of $25,000 and $2,500 related to a settlement agreement with PDL Biopharma and purchase of patents from Oklahoma Medical research Foundation, or OMRF, respectively. In July 2006, we acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode Island for the future commercial production of Soliris and development and manufacturing of future products. Since this date, we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full scale commercial manufacturing. We have also capitalized costs related to validation activities, including engineering runs and inventory production necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug. In December 2009, we received final regulatory approval for production of commercial quantities of eculizumab by the E.C. Accordingly, our plant is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, and therefore we placed the plant into service. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the FDA commenced its inspection of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and requested additional information regarding our manufacturing processes which we expect to address in 2010. Through December 31, 2009, we have capitalized $143,822 related to the facility, which includes all costs associated with construction, renovation and upgrades, engineering runs, pre approval inventory production and capitalized interest. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(14,270) and $28,308 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This amount related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of $30,733 and $28,893, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, this amount was offset by the $44,000 prepayment in full of our mortgage loan. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations related to our third party manufacturer, certain other third parties described below, for open letters of credit totaling $5,263 and for our $9,918 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012. 63 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable $ 9,918 $ $ 9,918 $ $ Interest expense 340 136 204 Capital and operating leases 39,331 8,943 15,272 9,310 5,806 Total contractual obligations $ 49,589 $ 9,079 $ 25,394 $ 9,310 $ 5,806 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development $ 35,175 $ 11,250 $ 15,725 $ 8,200 $ Licenses 1,840 365 740 735 Total commercial commitments $ 37,015 $ 11,615 $ 16,465 $ 8,935 $ The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described under the Risk Factors. The table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of $7,305 at December 31, 2009. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2009. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Convertible Notes We have outstanding $9,918 principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012, or the 1.375% Notes. We pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on February 1 and August 1 of each year. However, no principal payments are due until February 2012, except under certain circumstances such as liquidation, merger or business combination. The convertible notes payable do not contain covenants related to our financial performance. In October 2008, certain holders of the 1.375% Notes exercised conversion rights with respect to an aggregate principal amount of $52,778 of the 1.375% Notes resulting in the issuance of 3,356 shares of common stock. The shares were issued in November 2008. In April and May 2009, we issued an aggregate of 5,644 shares of our common stock in exchange for $87,304 principal amount of our 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 owned by certain note holders. The 1.375% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 63.5828 shares of common stock (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $15.73 per share) per $1 principal amount of the 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes. We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. The conversion rate and conversion price have been adjusted for the stock split effected on August 22, 2008. 64 As of December 31, 2009, the market value of our $9,918 principal amount of 1.375% Notes, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $30,732 versus $211,106 at December 31, 2008. The decrease of $180,374 from December 31, 2008 is largely attributable to the issuance of 5,644 shares of our common stock in exchange for $87,304 principal amount of the Notes in the second quarter of 2009. Mortgage Loan We had a mortgage loan of $44,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. In June 2009, we amended the mortgage loan agreement to permit the prepayment of the loan without penalty. We prepaid a portion of the mortgage loan each month beginning in July 2009 and made a final payment of the remaining principal balance in October 2009. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2008, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a financial institution to provide for an available $25,000 revolving credit facility that could be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The loan was collateralized by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries, but excluding intellectual property, assets of foreign subsidiaries and assets related to our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. The borrowing base was limited to the lesser of $25,000 or 80% of eligible domestic receivables. At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. In January 2010, we amended and restated the credit agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement, to, among other things, increase the revolving credit facility by $25,000. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $50,000 facility, with up to a $20,000 sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the facility to $75,000 in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. The loan is secured by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries and the real estate owned by Alexion Manufacturing LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary, but excluding intellectual property and assets of foreign subsidiaries. We have not borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement but may borrow under the agreement from time to time based on its needs. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1%, plus 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). We may prepay the loans, in whole or in part, in minimum amounts without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR borrowings. Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on January 22, 2013, the maturity date. We may borrow, repay and reborrow under the facility until January 22, 2013. The Amended Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. Further, the agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain 65 investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan. Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2013. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The average interest rates on the above capital leases is 3.76% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease 141,454 square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut and approximately 5,249 square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in Lausanne, Switzerland. Additionally, we lease research space in San Diego, California. In connection with the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies in 2006, we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease (see Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K). In September 2007, we entered into a sub lease for the AAT facility, which provides for sub lease payments to us through the term of the lease, or 2012. We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on going activities. In addition to the locations above, we also lease offices in certain countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization. Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG. Lonza Agreement We have a supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG relating to the manufacture of Soliris, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans for future levels of production by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. 66 We have agreed to purchase certain minimum quantities of product from Lonza under our existing arrangements. If we terminate the Lonza Agreement without cause, we will be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. Additional Commercial Commitments Additional payments related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating to approximately $1,350, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table. Income Taxes At December 31, 2009, we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $665,740, and $117,778, respectively. These NOLs expire between 2010 and 2028. We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of approximately $34,208 and $7,689, respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2010 and 2029. Due to the amount of our NOLs and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes in the foreseeable future. We do expect to pay cash taxes in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses. We were again subject to the alternative minimum tax during 2009 and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term. The payment of an alternative minimum tax amount generates a credit that may be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset our regular income tax liability. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. However, we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any of our federal NOLs. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2009, we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds, which are not subject to significant interest rate risk. At December 31, 2009, we held $18,916 in marketable securities with maturity dates of less than one year. These financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. However, we expect to hold time based investments, such as corporate bonds, through maturity. We estimate that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $19 in the fair value of our cash and investments, which had a weighted average duration of approximately 6.2 months at December 31, 2009. 67 Our outstanding long term liabilities as of December 31, 2009 included our $9,918, 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012. As the notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be impacted by interest rate changes. During the first quarter of 2008, we entered into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution to borrow up to $25,000. In January 2010, we amended and restated the credit agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement, to, among other things, increase the revolving credit facility to $50,000. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1%, plus 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). We do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements. Foreign Exchange Market Risk As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and British Pound. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. We currently have a derivative program in place to achieve two goals: 1) limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and 2) hedge a portion of our forecasted product sales, using contracts with duration of up to 24 months, to mitigate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Both programs utilize forward foreign exchange contracts intended to reduce, not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates. As of December 31, 2009, we held foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $284,895. As of December 31, 2009, our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a net fair value of $2,528. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The counterparty to these forward contracts is a multinational commercial bank. We believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material. Since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities, we do not expect that a hypothetical 10% adverse change fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets, which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our forward contracts. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales.
