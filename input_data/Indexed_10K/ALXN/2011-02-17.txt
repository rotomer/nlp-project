Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, included at the beginning of this Form 10 K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states, including those in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology including transplant rejection, neurology, ophthalmology and cancer. Our marketed product Soliris&reg; (eculizumab) is the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an ultra rare and life threatening blood disorder. We were incorporated in 1992 and began commercial sale of Soliris in 2007. Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology including transplant rejection, neurology and ophthalmology. Soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is an ultra rare, debilitating and life threatening, acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine (hemoglobinuria). Soliris was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission (E.C.) in 2007, by Japans Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in 2010 and has been approved in several other territories. Additionally, Soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories. In 2009, the FDA and E.C. granted Soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), an ultra rare, inherited and life threatening complement inhibitor deficiency disease that often progresses to end stage kidney disease, kidney failure or death. Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition 43 Table of Contents Contingent liabilities Inventories Research and development expenses Share based compensation Income taxes Revenue Recognition Net Product Sales Our principal source of revenue is product sales. We have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue: To date, our product sales have consisted solely of Soliris. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer, which is typically a hospital, physicians office, private or government pharmacy or other health care facility. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, such as value added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in the Companys statements of operations and do not impact net product sales. In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. We also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors. In addition to sales in countries where Soliris is commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs. The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales. Because of factors such as the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers generally carry limited inventory. We monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales is required. To date, actual refunds and returns have been negligible. We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid in the United States and other programs outside the United States, as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require an analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months. In March 2010, United States government healthcare legislation, which contains several provisions that impact rebates payable, was enacted. The provisions in the legislation which relate to rebates payable include an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate percentages, which is also extended as a discount to 340B institutions, and an extension of the Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid recipients. We have recorded estimated rebates payable according to the new legislation. If the provisions of this legislation change, we may revise our estimates of rebates payable, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. 44 Table of Contents We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 as follows: RebatesPayable Balance at December 31, 2007 $ (1,006 ) Current provisions relating to sales in current year (3,723 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 1,189 Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years 193 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ (3,347 ) Current provisions relating to sales in current year (6,024 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 2,165 Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years 3,138 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ (4,068 ) Current provisions relating to sales in current year (11,314 ) Payments/credits relating to sales in current year 6,488 Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years 4,234 Balance at December 31, 2010 $ (4,660 ) We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue. These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception. We record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled. Contingent liabilities We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgement is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. As additional information becomes available, or upon specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. These revisions in these estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average cost method. For products that are in initial clinical development, we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval, but subsequent to the filing of the Biologics License Application (BLA) when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. Inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a Phase III clinical trial. We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property, plant and equipment prior to approval of the facility by regulatory authorities. 45 Table of Contents We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may, after a period of time, no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, at which point we would adjust our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of our Soliris inventory. The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write offs may be required. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels, which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales. Research and Development Expenses We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed. Share Based Compensation We have one share based compensation plan known as the 2004 Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, the share based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts 46 Table of Contents and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reversed the valuation allowance recorded against a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the United States, resulting in a tax benefit of $215,516. The decision to reverse the valuation allowance was made after management determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized. We made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability, as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits. We also reversed the valuation allowance recorded against certain non U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2010 where realization of those assets was now more likely than not. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where the realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues: Net product sales $ 540,957 $ 386,800 $ 259,004 Contract research revenue 95 Total revenues 540,957 386,800 259,099 Cost of sales 64,437 45,059 28,366 Operating expenses: Research and development 98,394 81,915 62,581 Selling, general and administrative 227,488 172,767 133,543 Total operating expenses 325,882 254,682 196,124 Operating income 150,638 87,059 34,609 Other income (expense) (1,627 ) (3,745 ) 121 Income before income taxes 149,011 83,314 34,730 Income tax provision (benefit) 51,981 (211,852 ) 1,581 Net income $ 97,030 $ 295,166 $ 33,149 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.09 $ 3.46 $ 0.43 Diluted $ 1.04 $ 3.26 $ 0.39 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010 to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenues Revenues by significant geographic region are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Variance Revenues: United States $ 205,792 $ 159,829 29 % Europe 274,919 215,763 27 % Other 60,246 11,208 438 % $ 540,957 $ 386,800 40 % The increase in revenue for fiscal year 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally. The increase in treated patients was due to additional patients and physicians requesting Soliris therapy, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories, including approvals in Japan, included in Other above, which impacted sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. The increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately $9,277 for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity), primarily the Euro and British Pound, compared to USD, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. We recorded a gain in revenue of $8,778 and $3,363 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $64,437 and $45,059, or 12% of product revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris. On January 26, 2011, Novartis filed a civil action against Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and other biopharmaceuticals companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Novartis claims willful infringement by Alexion of U.S. Patent No. 5,688,688. Novartis seeks, among other things, monetary damages. If it is finally determined that we infringe the Novartis patent, we may be required to pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Soliris regarding certain manufacturing technology. Although we do not believe that the manufacture of Soliris infringes a valid patent claim owned by Novartis, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending against such action. Given the early stages of this litigation, Management does not believe a loss related to this matter is probable and the potential magnitude of such loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Expense Our research and development expense includes personnel, facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, as well as product development costs. We group our research and development expenses into two major categories: external direct expenses and all other R&D expenses. External direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development, product development and discovery research. Clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates. Product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development and regulatory functions. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates. Clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated. All other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products, our product development and our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program. The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 26,983 $ 20,591 $ 6,392 31 % Product development 10,789 9,674 1,115 12 % Discovery research 2,846 1,776 1,070 60 % Total external direct expenses 40,618 32,041 8,577 27 % Payroll and benefits 47,683 41,122 6,561 16 % Operating and occupancy 4,540 4,935 (395 ) 8 % Depreciation and amortization 5,553 3,817 1,736 45 % Total other R&D expenses 57,776 49,874 7,902 16 % Research and development expense $ 98,394 $ 81,915 $ 16,479 20 % 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 AccumulatedExpendituressince January 1,2006 External direct expenses Eculizumab: PNH program $ 6,661 $ 7,672 $ 60,087 Eculizumab: non PNH programs 17,934 11,345 31,615 Samalizumab 1,183 1,222 3,104 Pexelizumab 13,713 Unallocated 1,205 352 9,140 $ 26,983 $ 20,591 $ 117,659 Prior to January 1, 2006, we spent approximately $475,838 on all research & development programs. Substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended December 31, 2006 were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of PNH in 2007 in the United States and European Union, and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in 2006. The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to the Risk Factors in this Form 10 K. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred research and development expenses of $98,394, an increase of $16,479, or 20% versus the $81,915 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily related to the following: Increase of $6,561 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and preclinical programs. Increase of $6,392 in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, offset by decreases in spending on PNH programs (see table above). Increase of $1,070 in discovery research was primarily due to external research and consulting fees. Increase of $1,736 in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to depreciation on our Rhode Island Manufacturing facility which placed into service in December 2009. We expect our research and development expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2011 due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding eculizumab and samalizumab development programs, as well as expenses related to Taligen and Orphatec programs. For additional information on these programs, please refer to Product and Development Programs in Item I of this Form 10 K. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Our selling, general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel, corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products. These selling, general and administrative costs include: corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation; marketing and sales operations in support of Soliris; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and support personnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit and legal expenses. 50 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $227,488, an increase of $54,721, or 32%, versus the $172,767 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily related to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2010, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $134,669, an increase of $34,631, or 35%, versus $100,038 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $21,487 related to our global commercial operations teams. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $13,144 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure as a global commercial entity. Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $20,090 was due primarily to increases in marketing and consulting services of $11,984, increases in occupancy and depreciation expenses of $2,978 relating to new and expanded office spaces in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Latin America, increases of $2,268 relating to our charitable and compassionate care programs and increases of $1,112 in telecommunications and information technology expenses. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2011, reflecting our growth as a commercial organization throughout the world. Other Income and Expense Foreign currency transaction gains and losses relate to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $2,434 of foreign currency loss, an increase of $1,904, versus a loss of $530 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs. We recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2010, investment income increased $725, or 92% to $1,511 due primarily to higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. We incur interest on our convertible notes, revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense increased $98, or 16%, to $704 due primarily to a reduction in capitalized interest associated with our manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2009, and fees relating to our amended and restated credit facility, partially offset by the lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversions and exchanges during 2009 and 2010. We recorded $3,395 of non cash debt exchange expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the exchange of 5,644 shares for $87,304 principal amount of our 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes. The expense was recorded based on the fair value of the additional shares provided to the note holders over the stated conversion rate. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an income tax provision of $51,981, compared to a benefit of $211,852 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The income tax provision for 2010 is principally attributable to the U.S. Federal, state, and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations. The tax benefit reported in 2009 includes a benefit of $215,516 attributable to the release of valuation allowances against U.S. deferred tax assets, offset principally by income tax provisions for profitable foreign subsidiaries. The Company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland effective January 1, 2010, with a final expiration date in 2019. The tax holiday will exempt the Company from most local corporate income taxes in Switzerland through the end of 2014 and is expected to be renewed for an additional 5 years. 51 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009 to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues Revenues by significant geographic region are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Revenues: 2009 2008 % Variance United States $ 159,829 $ 113,299 41 % Europe 215,763 143,645 50 % Other 11,208 2,155 420 % $ 386,800 $ 259,099 49 % The increases in revenue for fiscal year 2009 versus 2008 were due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris in the United States and outside the United States. As additional physicians request Soliris and as governmental reimbursement for Soliris is provided for in more territories, we expect that the number of patients receiving Soliris treatment will increase, resulting in an increase in product sales in existing countries. We also expect product sales in the rest of the world to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the regulatory, price approval and reimbursement process in additional territories. We recorded a gain in revenue of $3,363 and $4,141 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We recorded no contract research revenues in the year ended December 31, 2009 and $95 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $45,059 and $28,366, or 12% and 11% of product revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris. Research and Development Expenses The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Year EndedDecember 31,2008 $Variance %Variance Clinical development $ 20,591 $ 17,889 $ 2,702 15 % Product development 9,674 8,258 1,416 17 % Discovery research 1,776 1,201 575 48 % Total external direct expenses 32,041 27,348 4,693 17 % Payroll and benefits 41,122 27,555 13,567 49 % Operating and occupancy 4,935 4,192 743 18 % Depreciation and amortization 3,817 3,486 331 9 % Total other R&D expenses 49,874 35,233 14,641 42 % Research and development expense $ 81,915 $ 62,581 $ 19,334 31 % 52 Table of Contents The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Year EndedDecember 31,2008 External direct expenses Eculizumab: PNH program $ 7,672 $ 14,112 Eculizumab: non PNH programs 11,345 1,657 Samalizumab 1,222 699 Unallocated 352 1,421 $ 20,591 $ 17,889 During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred research and development expenses of $81,915, an increase of $19,334, or 31% versus the $62,581 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: Increase of $13,567 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our expanding number of clinical programs and manufacturing and product development activities at our production facility in Smithfield RI. Increase of $2,702 external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, as well as growth of our samalizumab program, offset by decreases in spending on the PNH program (see table above). Increase of $1,416 in external product development expenses related primarily to increases in manufacturing development activities at our production facility in Smithfield RI. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $172,767, an increase of $39,224, or 29%, versus the $133,543 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following: During the year ended December 31, 2009, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $100,038, an increase of $24,775, or 33%, versus $75,263 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $17,962 related to our global commercial operations teams. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $6,813 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure as a global commercial entity. Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $14,449 was due primarily to increases in marketing and consulting services of $5,693, occupancy and depreciation expenses of $4,901 relating to new and expanded office space in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Latin America and $1,348 in telecommunications and information technology expenses. Other Income and Expense During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $530 of foreign currency loss, an increase of $248, versus a loss of $282 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, investment income decreased $2,024, or 72% to $786 due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds. 53 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $1,801, or 75%, to $606 due primarily to lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversion in October 2008 and exchange in April and May 2009. Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $211,852, compared to a provision of $1,581 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The tax benefit reported in 2009 includes a benefit of $215,516 attributable to the release of valuation allowances against U.S. deferred tax assets, offset principally by income tax provisions for profitable foreign subsidiaries. The valuation allowance was reversed after management determined that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets relating to the United States would be realized. We made the determination after evaluation of our levels of recent profitability, as well as forecasts of future taxable income which impact utilization of tax attributes, primarily net operating losses and research income tax credits. The income tax provision for 2008 is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in those foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of Federal research credits for cash. Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working capital as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were as follows: Financial assets: December 31,2010 December 31,2009 $Variance Cash and cash equivalents $ 267,145 $ 157,172 $ 109,973 Marketable securities 94,460 19,048 75,412 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 361,605 $ 176,220 $ 185,385 Select measures of liquidity and capital resources: December 31,2010 December 31,2009 $Variance Current assets $ 646,556 $ 373,456 $ 273,100 Current liabilities 138,515 85,262 53,253 Working capital $ 508,041 $ 288,194 $ 219,847 Current ratio 4.67 4.38 Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial, corporate and U.S. government and agency bonds and commercial paper in accordance with our investment policy. The stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital, provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily attributable to the increase in product sales and the related cash generated from operations. The increase in working capital was primarily due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and inventory offset primarily by an increase in accrued expenses. Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, corporate bonds, commercial paper, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative 54 Table of Contents contracts. At December 31, 2010, one individual customer accounted for 17.8% of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2009, one individual customer accounted for 20.0% of the accounts receivable balance. We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. As of December 31, 2010, we have foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $445,476. These outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of $(5,273), of which an unrealized gain of $9,955 is included in other assets, offset by an unrealized loss of $15,228 included in other liabilities. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material. In January 2010, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement to, among other things, increase our revolving credit facility by $25,000. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $50,000 revolving credit facility, with up to a $20,000 sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the facility to $75,000 in accordance with its terms. As of December 31, 2010, our accrued royalty balance of $50,133 includes estimates of royalties potentially owed to other third parties. The estimates of amounts potentially owed to other third parties may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims, if any, the results of which are uncertain. An increase in estimated amounts owed or a requirement to pay these amounts on an accelerated basis may result in a material adverse effect on liquidity. We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and product development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, international expansion, commercialization of products and capital investment. However, we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows Change in cash and cash equivalents: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $Variance Net cash provided by operating activities $ 160,906 $ 113,841 $ 47,065 Net cash used in investing activities (89,318 ) (81,423 ) (7,895 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 38,867 (14,270 ) 53,137 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (482 ) 1,012 (1,494 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 109,973 $ 19,160 $ 90,813 Operating Activities The increase in net cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the net income achieved in 2010 versus the net income achieved in the same period in 2009. The components of cash flows from operating activities, as reported in our Statement of Cash Flows, are as follows: Our reported net income, adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization, share based compensation expense, non cash debt exchange expense, deferred taxes, unrealized foreign currency gain, and unrealized loss on foreign exchange forward contracts, was $188,267 and $128,080 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was $27,361 and $14,239 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $27,361 change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to increases in accounts receivable of $59,239 due to the increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories. Additionally, the increase in inventory of $14,119 relates to increased production at our manufacturing facility in Rhode Island and resulting inventory buildup to support commercial growth. These increases were offset by an increase of $47,455 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which consists primarily of accrued royalties, payroll and taxes. In 2011, we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections, from Soliris. Investing Activities The components of cash flows from investing activities consisted of the following: Additions to property, plant and equipment were $12,823 and $35,275 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reduction in additions to property, plant and equipment was primarily as a result of the approval of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility by the E.C. in December 2009. Through the approval date, we capitalized costs associated with the construction and validation of our Rhode Island manufacturing facility, and we ceased capitalization of these costs beginning in January 2010. Purchases of marketable securities of $129,860 and sales of marketable securities of $53,387 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Payments of $25,000 and $2,500 related to the final payment for the PDL BioPharma patent settlement and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation patent purchase agreement for the year ended December 31, 2009. In January and February 2011, we completed business combinations of Taligen and Orphatec. These acquisitions required us to make upfront payments of approximately $114,000, which we have paid from our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. After these acquisitions, we continue to expect that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future. In addition to the upfront payments, these purchase agreements also include contingent payments totaling $367,000 for Taligen and $42,000 for Orphatec. We do not expect that any contingent payments will be made in the next 12 months and, accordingly, we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near term. As future payments become more probable, we will evaluate methods of funding payments, which could be made from available cash, cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing. Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities reflected proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $37,546 and $30,733 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2009, cash from financing activities was reduced by a $44,000 prepayment on our mortgage loan. 56 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5Years Contractual obligations: Convertible notes payable $ 3,718 $ $ 3,718 $ $ Interest expense 100 50 50 Capital leases 1,459 715 744 Operating leases 38,498 10,274 15,266 8,798 4,160 Total contractual obligations $ 43,775 $ 11,039 $ 19,778 $ 8,798 $ 4,160 Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development $ 39,000 $ 7,800 $ 11,700 $ 7,800 $ 11,700 Licenses 1,570 315 630 625 Total commercial commitments $ 40,570 $ 8,115 $ 12,330 $ 8,425 $ 11,700 The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described in "Risk Factors" and Note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of $8,658 at December 31, 2010. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2010. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. We also did not include contingent payments related to the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, as the timing of payment for these amounts is not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2010. Contingent payments for the business combinations total $367,000 for Taligen and $42,000 for Orphatec, and we do not expect to make any contingent payments in the next 12 months. Convertible Notes As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding $3,718 principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012 (1.375% Notes). We pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on February 1 and August 1 of each year. However, no principal payments are due until February 2012, except under certain circumstances such as liquidation, merger or business combination. The Notes do not contain covenants related to our financial performance. The 1.375% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 63.5828 shares of common stock (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $15.73 per share) per $1 principal amount of the 1.375% Notes, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes. We do not have the right to redeem any of the 1.375% Notes prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2010, $3,718 principal amount of the 1.375% Notes is outstanding, and the fair value, based on quoted market prices, was estimated at $18,892. The $11,840 decrease in fair value from December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the exchange of $6,200 principal amount of the notes for 394,211 shares of common stock during the first half of 2010. 57 Table of Contents Mortgage Loan We had a mortgage loan of $44,000 to finance the purchase and construction of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. In June 2009, we amended the mortgage loan agreement to permit the prepayment of the loan without penalty. We prepaid a portion of the mortgage loan each month beginning in July 2009 and made a final payment of the remaining principal balance in October 2009. Revolving Credit Facility In January 2010, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement, that provides for an available $50,000 revolving credit facility through January 22, 2013, with up to a $20,000 sublimit for letters of credit that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the facility to $75,000. The loan is collateralized by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries and Rhode Island facility, but excluding intellectual property and assets of foreign subsidiaries. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1.00%, plus 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). Interest is payable quarterly for Base Rate loans and, in the case of LIBOR based loans, at the end of the applicable interest period, with the principal due on January 22, 2013, the maturity date. The Amended Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. Further, the agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility. We had open letters of credit of $6,647 at December 31, 2010. Capital Leases We currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2013. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The average interest rates on the above capital leases is 4.02% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease. Operating Leases Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease 205,554 square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut and approximately 26,500 square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in Lausanne, Switzerland. Additionally, we lease research space in San Diego, California. In connection with the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies in 2006, we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease. In September 2007, we entered into a sub lease for the AAT facility, which provides for sub lease payments to us through the term of the lease, or 2012. 58 Table of Contents We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on going activities. In addition to the locations above, we also lease offices in certain countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization. Commercial Commitments Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG. Lonza Agreement We have a supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG relating to the manufacture of Soliris, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. We have agreed to purchase certain minimum quantities of product from Lonza under our existing arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we have remaining contractual commitments of approximately $39,000. If we terminate the Lonza Agreement without cause, we will be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. Additional Commercial Commitments Additional payments related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating to approximately $1,350, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table. Income Taxes At December 31, 2010, we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $579,308, and $86,138, respectively. These NOLs expire between 2011 and 2029. We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of approximately $37,913 and $4,199, respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2011 and 2030. Due to the amount of our NOLs and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes in the foreseeable future. We do expect to pay cash taxes in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses. We were again subject to the alternative minimum tax during 2010 and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term. The payment of an alternative minimum tax amount generates a credit that may be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset our regular income tax liability. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. However, we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any of our federal NOLs. 59 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2010, we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds, which are not subject to significant interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2010, we held $94,460 in marketable securities with maturity dates of less than one year. These financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. However, we expect to hold time based investments, such as corporate bonds and commercial paper, through maturity. We estimate that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 in the fair value of our cash and investments, which had a weighted average duration of approximately 4.6 months at December 31, 2010. In January 2010, we entered into a $50,000 amended and restated revolving credit facility, the Amended Credit Agreement. We may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement), or (ii) a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1%, plus 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the ratio of our cash to liabilities (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). We do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements. Foreign Exchange Market Risk As a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and British Pound against the U.S. dollar. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. We have substantial operations based in Switzerland to support our business outside the U.S. and Canada, and accordingly, our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. dollar. We currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following: 1) limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, using contracts with durations of up to 30 days and 2) hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales, using contracts with durations of up to 36 months. The objective of these programs is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues. Both programs utilize foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce, not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates. As of December 31, 2010, we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $445,476. As of December 31, 2010, our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of $(5,273). We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks. We believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material. Since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities, we do not expect that a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets, which include our monetary assets and 60 Table of Contents liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales.
