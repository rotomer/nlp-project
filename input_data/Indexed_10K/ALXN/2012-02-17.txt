Item 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (amounts in thousands, except percentages and per share data)In addition to historical information, this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A Risk Factors, and the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, included at the beginning of this Form 10 K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K.OverviewWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra rare disorders through the innovation, development and commercialization of life transforming therapeutic products. Our marketed product Soliris (eculizumab) is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two ultra rare and severe disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an ultra rare and life threatening blood disorder, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an ultra rare and life threatening genetic disease. We are also evaluating other potential indications for Soliris in other diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism, and we are progressing with other biotechnology product candidates in ultra rare and severe disorders which are now in various stages of development. We were incorporated in 1992 and began commercial sale of Soliris in 2007.Soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, transplant rejection, neurology and ophthalmology. Soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks terminal complement activity at the doses currently prescribed. The initial indication for which we received approval for Soliris is PNH. PNH is an ultra rare, debilitating and life threatening, deficiency blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine (hemoglobinuria).Soliris was approved for the treatment of PNH by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission (EC) in 2007 and by Japans Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in 2010, and has been approved in 40several other territories. Additionally, in 2003 Soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.In September 2011, Soliris was approved by the FDA for the treatment of all pediatric and adult patients with aHUS. aHUS is a genetic ultra rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy, the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs. Also in November 2011, the EC granted marketing authorization for Soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with aHUS in Europe. In 2009, the FDA and EC granted Soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with aHUS.On February 7, 2012, we acquired Enobia Pharma Corp. (Enobia), a privately held clinical stage biotechnology company based in Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction expected to be accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition was intended to further our objective to develop and deliver therapies for patients with ultra rare, severe, and life threatening disorders. Enobias lead product candidate asfotase alfa, is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia (HPP), an ultra rare, life threatening, genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments. We made an upfront cash payment of $610,000, subject to purchase price adjustments, for 100% of Enobias capital stock. Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $470,000 would be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones. We financed the acquisition through available cash and proceeds from our new credit facility.On February 8, 2011, we acquired patents and assets from Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Orphatec) related to an investigational therapy for patients with Type A molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD), an ultra rare disorder characterized by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborn infants. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. Orphatec is a privately held development stage biotechnology company with headquarters in Cologne, Germany. We made an upfront cash payment of approximately $3,050, and additional contingent payments of up to $42,000 would be earned upon reaching various development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We will also make future payments to Orphatec for manufacturing, development and other services.On January 28, 2011, we acquired Taligen Therapeutics, Inc. (Taligen), a privately held development stage biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition was intended to broaden our portfolio of preclinical compounds and to expand our capabilities in translational medicine. Preclinical compounds acquired from Taligen include product candidates for the potential treatment of patients with ophthalmic diseases such as age related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as other novel antibody and protein regulators of the complement inflammatory pathways. We made an upfront cash payments of $111,773 for 100% of Taligens equity interests. Additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $367,000 would be due upon reaching various clinical efficacy and product approval milestones in both the United States and European Union for up to six product candidates. Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of EstimatesThe significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:Revenue recognition;Contingent liabilities;Inventories;Research and development expenses;Share based compensation;Valuation of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and in process research and development (IPR&D);Valuation of contingent consideration; andIncome taxes.41Revenue RecognitionNet Product SalesOur principal source of revenue is product sales. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer, which is typically a hospital, physicians office, private or government pharmacy or other health care facility. Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, such as value added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations and do not impact net product sales.In the United States, our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, infusion clinics or home health care providers. We also sell Soliris to government agencies. Outside the United States, our customers are primarily hospitals, hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers and distributors. Because of factors such as the pricing of Soliris, the limited number of patients, the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, Soliris customers often carry limited inventory. We also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels, contractual terms and financial strength of distributors. To date, actual refunds and returns have been negligible. We have entered into volume based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount. We estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations, based on estimated sales during the limited period, and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue. In addition to sales in countries where Soliris is commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving Soliris treatment through named patient programs. The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where Soliris has not received final approval for commercial sale. We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid in the United States and other programs outside the United States, as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. Generally, the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months.We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 as follows: RebatesPayableBalance at December 31, 2008$(3,347)Current provisions relating to sales in current year(6,024)Payments/credits relating to sales in current year2,165Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years3,138Balance at December 31, 2009$(4,068)Current provisions relating to sales in current year(11,314)Payments/credits relating to sales in current year6,488Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years4,234Balance at December 31, 2010$(4,660)Current provisions relating to sales in current year(36,045)Payments/credits relating to sales in current year15,226Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years3,733Balance at December 31, 2011$(21,746)We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue, unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration, and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. If both conditions are met, we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense. These costs are typically known at the time of 42sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception. We record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled.We sell Soliris to a limited number of customers, and we evaluate the creditworthiness of each such customer on a regular basis. In certain European countries, sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined. This is primarily the case in countries where the payor is government owned or government funded, which we consider to be creditworthy. The length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries typically exceeds our credit terms. In countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms, we seek to collect interest. We record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected. For non interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year, we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue. Subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. We also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful.We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, associated impacts on the financial markets and our business and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, among other members of the European Union have deteriorated throughout 2011. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable in Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal were approximately $83,400. Approximately $24,000 of this amount has been outstanding for greater than one year, and we have recorded an allowance of approximately $3,500 related to these receivables as of December 31, 2011. In July 2011, we received non interest bearing bonds issued by the Greek government that mature in 2012 and 2013 for payment on receivables from 2008 and 2009 as part of the Greek governments plan for its repayment of its debt to international pharmaceutical companies. We sold the bonds in July 2011.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we have recorded bad debt expense of approximately $4,100 related to the reduction of value of Greek bonds and other reduction in the realizable value of our accounts receivable in these countries.Contingent liabilitiesWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average cost method.We capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale, including costs incurred prior to regulatory approval but subsequent to the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) when we have determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. Inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a Phase III clinical trial. For products with an approved indication, raw materials and purchased drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when consumed. For products without and approved indication, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon final quality release. We also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property, plant and equipment prior to the approval of the facility by regulatory authorities.We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may, after a period of time, no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, at which point we would adjust our inventory values. Soliris currently has a maximum estimated life 43of 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of the Soliris inventory. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels, which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales.The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write offs may be required.Research and Development ExpensesWe accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in research and development expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. The estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed.Share Based CompensationWe grant equity awards under one share based compensation plan known as the 2004 Amended and Restated Incentive Plan. Under this plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Stock related awards are also outstanding under other share based compensation plans but we have not granted awards under these plans since 2004.Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise, forfeiture or cancellation, as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates. If factors change or we employ different assumptions, the share based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts.Valuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and IPR&DWe have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR&D primarily through the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D, are acquired, we determine the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: timing and costs to complete the in process projects;timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; anddiscount rates. We may also utilize a cost approach, which estimates the costs that would be incurred to replace the assets being purchased. Significant inputs into the cost approach include estimated rates of return on historical costs that a market participant would expect to pay for these assets.Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives 44and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur.Intangible assets related to IPR&D are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. If these projects are not successfully developed, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets, including IPR&D, may become impaired if the underlying projects do not progress as we initially estimated. We believe that the assumptions used in developing our estimates of intangible asset values were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisitions. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs, profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will occur as estimated.Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value, as determined by our traded share price, as compared to our book value of net assets. We completed our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2011 and determined the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired.Valuation of Contingent ConsiderationWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones, such as sales levels of a specific compound; anddiscount rates.Our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Income TaxesWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that has been taken or we expect to take on income tax returns if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained.We follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.45We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material adjustments to income tax expense in that period.New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The new standard changes fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements including measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio, the application of applying premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement, and additional disclosure about fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect a material impact with the adoption of this new standard.In June 2011, the FASB issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income. The new standard eliminated the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Under the new standard, companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new standard is effective at the beginning of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and we will comply with this requirement in the first quarter 2012. In September 2011, the FASB issued a new standard to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the new standard, a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K.

The increase in treated patients was due to additional patients and physicians requesting Soliris therapy, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories, including approval for PNH in Japan in the third quarter of 2010, Australia in the first quarter of 2011 and in certain provinces in Canada in the third quarter of 2011 and approval for aHUS in the United States in the third quarter 2011. The increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately $815 for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity) versus the dollar for the year ended December 31, 2010. The negative impact was primarily due to the Euro and the British Pound offset by a positive impact of the Japanese Yen. We recorded a (loss) gain in revenue of $(6,558) and $8,778 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Cost of SalesCost of sales were $93,140 and $64,437, or 12% of product revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris.We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our cost of sales.Research and Development ExpenseOur research and development expense includes personnel, facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, as well as product development costs. We group our research and development expenses into two major categories: external direct expenses and all other R&D expenses.External direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development, product development and discovery research. Clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates. Product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development and regulatory functions. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates. Clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated.All other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products, our product development and our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program.47The following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 $Variance %VarianceClinical development$33,417 $26,983 $6,434 24%Product development23,133 10,789 12,344 114%Discovery research5,850 2,846 3,004 106%Total external direct expenses62,400 40,618 21,782 54%Payroll and benefits64,068 47,683 16,385 34%Operating and occupancy5,046 4,540 506 11%Depreciation and amortization5,907 5,553 354 6%Total other R&D expenses75,021 57,776 17,245 30%Research and development expense$137,421 $98,394 $39,027 40%The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs.

Substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended December 31, 2006 were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of PNH in 2007 in the United States and European Union, and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in 2006.The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to the Risk Factors in this Form 10 K.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred research and development expenses of $137,421, an increase of $39,027, or 40% versus the $98,394 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily related to the following:Increase of $16,385 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs.Increase of $12,344 in external product development expenses related primarily to costs associated with our nephrology clinical programs and regulatory affairs for supporting our clinical programs, including aHUS.Increase of $6,434 in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, including costs for the STEC HUS trial initiated in the second quarter 2011 (see table above).Increase of $3,004 in discovery research expenses related primarily to costs associated with our new Translation Medicine group initiated from the acquisition of Taligen.We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2012 due to clinical development and manufacturing costs 48related to our expanding development programs, as well as expenses related to Enobia programs. For additional information on these programs, please refer to Product and Development Programs in Item I "Business" of this Form 10 K.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseOur selling, general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel, corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products. These selling, general and administrative costs include: corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation; marketing and sales operations in support of Soliris; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and support personnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit and legal expenses.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $308,176, an increase of $81,410, or 36%, versus the $226,766 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily related to the following:During the year ended December 31, 2011, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $185,018, an increase of $50,483, or 38%, versus $134,535 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $35,943 related to our global commercial staff to support global expansion and to prepare for the initiation of Soliris as a therapy for aHUS which was granted approval in the United States and Europe in the fourth quarter 2011. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $14,540 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure growth as a global commercial entity.Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $30,927 was primarily due to costs associated with marketing and professional services of $26,410, occupancy costs of $4,528 due to expansion of current facilities in the United States and Switzerland and new facilities in Turkey, India and China and, increases of $2,544 due to increased bad debt expense associated with declines in credit ratings on our Greek receivables in quarters subsequent to the recognition of the corresponding revenue.We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, at a lower rate than our revenue, in 2012, reflecting our growth as a commercial organization throughout the world.Acquisition related CostsWe incurred the following acquisition related costs in 2011 associated with our acquisitions of Taligen, Orphatec and Enobia: December 31, 2011Separately identifiable employee costs$6,597Professional fees5,489Changes in fair value of contingent consideration1,400 $13,486Other Income and ExpenseForeign currency transaction gains and losses relate to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $2,281 of foreign currency loss, a decrease of $153, versus a loss of $2,434 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs.We recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, investment income increased $400, or 26% to $1,911 due primarily to higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.We incur interest on our convertible notes, revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, interest expense increased $84, to $788.49Income TaxesDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an income tax provision of $54,353 and an effective tax rate of 23.7%, compared to an income tax provision of $51,981 and an effective tax rate of 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The income tax provision for 2011 and 2010 is principally attributable to the U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations. In September 2011, we completed our assessment of the impact the election to claim federal foreign tax credits and the federal orphan drug credits would have on our historical tax returns. Based on this assessment, management elected to claim both the foreign tax credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 and orphan drug credit for the tax years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The net federal income tax benefit recorded during 2011 as a result of the election to claim the federal foreign tax credit for 2010 and the federal orphan drug credit for 2010 and 2009 was approximately $15,400. The Company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland effective January 1, 2010, with a final expiration date in 2019. The tax holiday will exempt the Company from most local corporate income taxes in Switzerland through the end of 2014 and is expected to be renewed for an additional 5 years.Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010 to the Year Ended December 31, 2009Net Product SalesRevenues by significant geographic region are as follows: Year Ended December 31,Net product sales:2010 2009 % VarianceUnited States$205,792 $159,829 29%Europe275,608 215,763 28%Other59,557 11,208 431% $540,957 $386,800 40%The increases in revenue for fiscal year 2010 versus 2009 were primarily due to an increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally. The increase in treated patients was due to additional patients and physicians requesting Soliris therapy, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories, including approvals in Japan, included in Other above, which impacted sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2010.The increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately $9,277 for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity), primarily the Euro and British Pound, compared to the US dollar, versus the year ended December 31, 2009. We recorded a gain in revenue of $8,778 and $3,363 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, which is included in revenue from outside the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Cost of SalesCost of sales was $64,437 and $45,059, or 12% of product revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of Soliris.50Research and Development ExpensesThe following table provides information regarding research and development expenses: Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 $Variance %VarianceClinical development$26,983 $20,591 $6,392 31 %Product development10,789 9,674 1,115 12 %Discovery research2,846 1,776 1,070 60 %Total external direct expenses40,618 32,041 8,577 27 %Payroll and benefits47,683 41,122 6,561 16 %Operating and occupancy4,540 4,935 (395) (8)%Depreciation and amortization5,553 3,817 1,736 45 %Total other R&D expenses57,776 49,874 7,902 16 %Research and development expense$98,394 $81,915 $16,479 20 %The following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, Business, for a description of each of these programs: Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009External direct expenses Eculizumab: PNH program$6,661 $7,672Eculizumab: non PNH programs17,934 11,345Samalizumab1,183 1,222Unallocated1,205 352 $26,983 $20,591During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred research and development expenses of $98,394, an increase of $16,479, or 20% versus the $81,915 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily related to the following:Increase of $6,561 in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and preclinical programs.Increase of $6,392 in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non PNH indications, offset by decreases in spending on PNH programs (see table above).Increase of $1,070 in discovery research was primarily due to external research and consulting fees.Increase of $1,736 in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to depreciation on ARIMF which was placed into service in December 2009.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses (including acquisition related costs) of $227,488, an increase of $54,721, or 32%, versus the $172,767 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily related to the following:During the year ended December 31, 2010, salaries, benefits and other labor expenses increased to $134,669, an increase of $34,631, or 35%, versus $100,038 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities, including increases in payroll and benefits costs of $21,487 related to our global commercial operations teams. This increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of $13,144 within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure as a global commercial entity.51Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $20,090 was due primarily to increases in marketing and consulting services of $11,984, increases in occupancy and depreciation expenses of $2,978 relating to new and expanded office spaces in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Latin America, increases of $2,268 relating to our charitable and compassionate care programs and increases of $1,112 in telecommunications and information technology expenses.Other Income and Expense During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $2,434 of foreign currency loss, an increase of $1,904, versus a loss of $530 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs.We recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2010, investment income increased $725, or 92% to $1,511 due primarily to higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. During the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense increased $98, or 16%, to $704 due primarily to a reduction in capitalized interest associated with ARIMF, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2009, and fees relating to our amended and restated credit facility, partially offset by the lower principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of the note conversions and exchanges during 2009 and 2010.We recorded $3,395 of non cash debt exchange expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the exchange of 5,644 shares for $87,304 principal amount of our 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes. The expense was recorded based on the fair value of the additional shares provided to the note holders over the stated conversion rate.Income TaxesDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an income tax provision of $51,981, compared to a benefit of $211,852 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The income tax provision for 2010 is principally attributable to the U.S. Federal, state, and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations. The tax benefit reported in 2009 includes a benefit of $215,516 attributable to the release of valuation allowances against U.S. deferred tax assets, offset principally by income tax provisions for profitable foreign subsidiaries. Liquidity and Capital Resources (amounts in thousands, except per share data)Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working capital as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were as follows:Financial assets: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 $VarianceCash and cash equivalents$540,865 $267,145 $273,720Marketable securities 94,460 (94,460)Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$540,865 $361,605 $179,260Select measures of liquidity and capital resources: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 $VarianceCurrent assets$941,270 $646,556 $294,714Current liabilities230,225 138,515 91,710Working capital$711,045 $508,041 $203,004Current ratio4.09 4.67 The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily attributable to cash generated from 52operations and stock option exercises, offset by the usage of cash for the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions. The decrease in the current ratio was primarily due to an increase in our royalties, rebates payable and deferred revenue and the usage of cash for the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions. Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial, corporate and U.S. government and agency bonds and commercial paper in accordance with our investment policy. The stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital, provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions.Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents, corporate bonds, commercial paper, accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts. At December 31, 2011, two individual customers accounted for 18% and 13% of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2010, one individual customer accounted for 18% of the accounts receivable balance. We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, associated impacts on the financial markets and our business and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The credit and economic conditions with Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, among other members of the European Union have deteriorated throughout 2011. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable in Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal were approximately $83,400. Approximately $24,000 of this amount has been outstanding for greater than one year, and we have recorded an allowance of approximately $3,500 related to these receivables as of December 31, 2011. We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we have foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $692,577. These outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of $14,854, of which an unrealized gain of $25,328 is included in other assets, offset by an unrealized loss of $10,474 included in other liabilities. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material.At December 31, 2011, our financial assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value. We have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, but substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Our level 2 assets consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. corporate bonds, federal agency obligations and foreign exchange forward contracts. Our Level 2 liabilities consist also of foreign exchange forward contracts. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Our Level 3 liabilities consist of contingent consideration related to the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions.In March 2011, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement to provide for a $100,000 revolving credit facility, with up to a $20,000 sublimit for letters of credit, to be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility other than open letters of credit of $3,754. Our borrowing availability was approximately $96,000 at December 31, 2011. In February 2012, we terminated this credit facility and entered into a $440,000 credit facility as described below.In February 2012, we and our wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Srl, entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that provides for a $240,000 senior secured term loan facility and a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a $60,000 sublimit for letters of credit and a $10,000 sublimit for swingline loans. On February 7, 2012 we borrowed $320,000 and used the facilities to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Enobia. We may also use the facilities for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders, Alexion may increase commitments under the term loan facility and or the revolving facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150,000 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Any of Alexions wholly owned foreign subsidiaries may borrow funds under the facilities upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2011, our accrued royalty balance of $82,010 includes estimates of royalties potentially owed to other third parties. The estimates of amounts potentially owed to other third parties may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims, if any, the results of which are uncertain. An increase in estimated amounts owed or a requirement to pay these amounts on an accelerated basis may result in a material adverse effect on liquidity.We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and product development, clinical 53trials, regulatory approvals, international expansion, commercialization of products and capital investment. However, we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future.Cash FlowsChange in cash and cash equivalents: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $VarianceNet cash provided by operating activities$270,084 $160,906 $109,178Net cash used in investing activities(33,717) (89,318) 55,601Net cash provided by financing activities39,050 38,867 183Effect of exchange rate changes on cash(1,697) (482) (1,215)Net change in cash and cash equivalents$273,720 $109,973 $163,747The increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2011 was primarily due to cash generated from operations, maturities of marketable securities, and stock option exercises, offset by cash used for the Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions.Operating ActivitiesThe components of cash flows from operating activities, as reported in our Statement of Cash Flows, are as follows:Our reported net income was $175,315 and $97,030 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Non cash items included depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration, share based compensation expense, deferred taxes, marketable securities premium amortization, unrealized foreign currency (gain) loss, gains and losses on forward contracts, currency translation adjustments, and loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and were $111,952 and $91,237 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was $17,183 and $27,361 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The $17,183 change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to:Increases in accounts receivable of $78,778 due to the increased number of patients treated with Soliris globally, as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories. Increase in inventory of $12,179 relates to increased production at ARIMF and resulting inventory buildup to support commercial growth.Increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $21,040, mainly related to tax receivables and prepaid taxes. Increases were offset by an increase of $15,033 in deferred revenue due to increased shipments in advance of recognizing revenue and an increase of $79,781 in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to rebates, royalties and compensation.In 2012, we expect increases in cash flow from operations which will be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections, from Soliris.Investing ActivitiesThe components of cash flows from investing activities consisted of the following:Additions to property, plant and equipment were $21,982 and $12,823 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 54Maturities of marketable securities of $94,458 and $53,387 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Purchases of marketable securities of $129,860 for the year ended December 31, 2010.Payments of $105,886 related to the acquisitions of Taligen and Orphatec.In February 2012, we completed a business combination of Enobia. This acquisition required us to make payments of approximately $610,000, which we have paid from our available cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from our new credit facility. The integration of Enobia into our current operations is in the initial phases. We are also in the initial stages of evaluating the tax impact of the Enobia acquisition. We have made preliminary plans for structuring the Enobia legal entities, including a determination of which legal entities will own the acquired assets, which could create a tax liability during 2012. Based on a preliminary analysis, the amount of tax liability could be up to $100,000. We have not determined the timing or amount of the tax liability, and the final amounts and timing could change based on various factors such as finalization of asset valuations and further tax analyzes related to the acquired assets. We believe we will have sufficient available cash to pay the liability when it becomes due. In addition to the upfront payments, the purchase agreements for the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions also include contingent payments totaling up to $470,000, $367,000 and $42,000, respectively, if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved. Of these milestone amounts, $564,000 and $315,000 of the contingent payments relate to development and commercial milestones, respectively. We do not expect that any contingent payments will be made in the next 12 months and, accordingly, we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near term. As future payments become probable, we will evaluate methods of funding payments, which could be made from available cash, cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing.Financing ActivitiesNet cash flows from financing activities reflected proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $35,765 and $37,546 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In February 2012, we and our wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Srl, entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that provides for a $240,000 senior secured term loan facility and a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a $60,000 sublimit for letters of credit and a $10,000 sublimit for swingline loans. We may also use the facilities for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders, Alexion may increase commitments under the term loan facility and or the revolving facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150,000 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Any of Alexions wholly owned foreign subsidiaries may borrow funds under the Facilities upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Credit Agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Enobia in February 2012, we borrowed approximately $320,000 under the facility and used our available cash for the remaining purchase price. We borrowed $240,000 under the term loan facility and $80,000 under the revolving facility. The term loan facility requires minimum quarterly payments of $12,000 starting in June 2012, and we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund the required principal and interest payments. We expect to repay the revolving facility over the next 1 to 2 years as we generate cash from operations. In addition to the amounts borrowed, approximately $116,000 is available for borrowing under the revolving facility which we can utilize as needed. We are in compliance with our covenants on the date of borrowing, and we forecast compliance with these covenants on an ongoing basis. We also seek to maintain a minimum cash balance representing at least one year of operating expenses, and we may utilize the revolving facility to meet this cash balance.Since the commercial launch of Soliris in 2007, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to be able to fund for the foreseeable future, our operations including principal and interest payments on our credit facility and contingent payments from our acquisitions principally through our cash flows from operations and our existing cash resources and access to additional financing, if necessary. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.The company does not provide US taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non US subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the businesses offshore. The company does not have any present or anticipated future need for cash held by its non US subsidiaries, as cash generated in the US as well as borrowings are expected to be sufficient to meet future US liquidity needs.55Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5YearsContractual obligations: Convertible notes payable$718 $718 $ $ $Interest expense10 10 Capital leases973 779 194 Operating leases49,754 12,089 17,434 8,972 11,259Total contractual obligations$51,455 $13,596 $17,628 $8,972 $11,259Commercial commitments: Clinical and manufacturing development$135,620 $40,200 $29,990 $31,590 $33,840Licenses1,065 253 406 406 Total commercial commitments$136,685 $40,453 $30,396 $31,996 $33,840The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described in Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As noted in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded accrued liabilities of $82,010 related to known and potential royalty amounts. We have not included the amounts in the table above, as the precise timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2011. We have recorded the full amount within current liabilities on our balance sheet to reflect that the full amount could be payable in the next 12 months.The table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of $9,773 at December 31, 2011. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2011. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.We also did not include contingent payments related to the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, as the timing of payment for these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2011. Contingent payments for the business combinations total up to $470,000 for Enobia, $367,000 for Taligen and $42,000 for Orphatec. We do not expect to make any contingent payments in the next 12 months.Convertible NotesAs of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding $718 principal amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2012 (1.375% Notes). In February 2012, the 1.375% Notes became due. We issued an additional 91 shares of our common stock upon conversion of $718 principal amount. Subsequent to the February 2012 conversion, we have no 1.375% Notes outstanding.Revolving Credit FacilityIn March 2011, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, that provided for an available $100,000 revolving credit facility through March 7, 2014. The loan was collateralized by substantially all of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s assets, including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries and real estate located in Rhode Island, but excluding intellectual property and assets of foreign subsidiaries. 56As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility, and we had open letters of credit of $3,754. Our borrowing availability was approximately $96,000 at December 31, 2011. In February 2012, we terminated this credit facility and entered into a $440,000 credit facility as described below.New Credit FacilityIn February 2012, we and our wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Alexion Pharma International Srl, entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that provides for a $240,000 senior secured term loan facility and a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit facility, which includes up to a $60,000 sublimit for letters of credit and a $10,000 sublimit for swingline loans. We may also use the facilities for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders, Alexion may increase commitments under the term loan facility and or the revolving facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $150,000 in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Any of Alexions wholly owned foreign subsidiaries may borrow funds under the Facilities upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Credit Agreement. On February 7, 2012, we borrowed $240,000 under the term loan facility and $80,000 under the revolving facility to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Enobia.Capital LeasesWe currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in 2014. The assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. The average interest rates on the above capital leases is 4.04% and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease.Operating LeasesOur operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease approximately 235,300 square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in Cheshire, Connecticut and approximately 33,250 square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in Lausanne, Switzerland. Additionally, we lease research space in San Diego, California. In connection with the closure of Alexion Antibody Technologies in 2006, we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease. In September 2007, we entered into a sub lease for the AAT facility, which provides for sub lease payments to us through the term of the lease, or August 2012.We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on going activities. In addition to the locations above, we also lease offices in other countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization.Commercial CommitmentsOur commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza Sales AG.Lonza AgreementWe have supply agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacture of eculizumab, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of contract and as product is manufactured. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of ARIMF. We currently rely on two manufacturing facilities, ARIMF and Lonza, for producing commercial and clinical quantities of Soliris. Our clinical and preclinical quantities of eculizumab, samalizumab and other product candidates are produced at ARIMF, at a third party facility or at both ARIMF and a third party facility. We also depend on a very limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements, including product finishing, packaging, vialing and labeling.57 We have various agreements with Lonza, with remaining total commitments of approximately $136,000 through 2018. Such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances. If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, we also pay Lonza a royalty on sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF. Additional Commercial CommitmentsAdditional payments related to our commercial commitments, such as licenses, aggregating to approximately $1,350, would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached (including achievement of commercialization). These amounts are not included in the above table.Income TaxesAt December 31, 2011, we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $464,918, and $109,095, respectively. These NOLs expire between 2012 and 2031. We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of approximately $72,278 and $1,361, respectively. These income tax credits expire between 2012 and 2031. Due to the amount of our NOLs and credit carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying substantial U.S. federal income taxes in the near future. We do expect to pay cash taxes in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayers ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of 50 percent over a three year period. We have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year. However, we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any significant amount of our federal NOLs.Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.(amounts in thousands, except per share data)Interest Rate RiskAs of December 31, 2011, we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds, which are not subject to significant interest rate risk.Certain of our debt instruments are variable interest rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is, therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense.In February 2012, we entered into the Credit Agreement. Alexion may elect that the loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.00% depending on Alexions consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement), or (ii) in the case of borrowings in U.S. dollars, a Base Rate equal to the higher of the (A) Prime Rate then in effect, (B) Federal Funds Rate then in effect plus 0.50%, and (C) Eurodollar Rate then in effect plus 1%, plus in each case of (A), (B) or (C) 0.25% to 1.00% depending on Alexions consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the agreement). We do not expect changes in interest rates related to the Credit Agreement to have a material effect on our financial statements.Foreign Exchange Market RiskAs a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses. We have substantial operations based in Switzerland to support our business outside the U.S., and accordingly, our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. dollar.We currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following: 1) limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, using contracts with durations of up to 30 days and 2) hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales, using contracts with durations of up to 36 months. The objectives of this program 58are to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues. This program utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce, not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates.As of December 31, 2011, we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $692,577. As of December 31, 2011, our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of $14,854.We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks. We believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material.Since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities, we do not expect that a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive net assets, which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts. The analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales.Credit RiskAs a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries we conduct business in. We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, associated impacts on the financial markets and our business and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The credit and economic conditions with Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, among other members of the European Union have deteriorated throughout 2011. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable in Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal were approximately $83,400. Approximately $24,000 of this amount has been outstanding for greater than one year, and we have recorded an allowance of approximately $3,500 related to these receivables as of December 31, 2011. In July 2011, we received non interest bearing bonds issued by the Greek government that mature in 2012 and 2013 for payment on receivables from 2008 and 2009 as part of the Greek governments plan for its repayment of its debt to international pharmaceutical companies. We sold the bonds in July 2011.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we have recorded bad debt expense of approximately $4,100 related to the reduction of value of Greek bonds and other reduction in the realizable value of our accounts receivable in these countries.
