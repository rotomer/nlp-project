Overview Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor and semiconductor related fabrication equipment, providing nanomanufacturing technologytm solutions to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and other industries. Product development and manufacturing activities occur in North America, Europe and Israel. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force. Customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts distribution system and trained service engineers located around the world in close proximity to customer sites. As a supplier to these industries, Applieds results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for chips and flat panel displays, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. The industries in which Applied operates are volatile and its results in fiscal 2004 through 2006 reflect this volatility. The following table presents certain significant measurements of the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 8,982 $ 6,389 $ 9,888 Net sales $ 8,013 $ 6,992 $ 9,167 Gross margin $ 3,701 $ 3,086 $ 4,292 Gross margin percent 46.2 % 44.1 % 46.8 % Net income $ 1,351 $ 1,210 $ 1,517 Earnings per share $ 0.78 $ 0.73 $ 0.97 Operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a recovery from a downturn in the semiconductor industry and the global economy, as well as realized savings from Applieds fiscal 2003 realignment activities. In addition, Applied gained market share in critical areas, including 300mm equipment and copper interconnect, and improved its operational efficiencies. Fiscal 2005 results reflected a challenging environment as Applieds customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for chips. In this period, Applied focused on lowering costs, improving efficiencies, reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, customer demand for Applied products began to increase. 24 Table of Contents Customer demand further improved in fiscal 2006, resulting in higher orders and revenue. Fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and semiconductor related industries and the global economy as end user demand for electronic products and flat panel displays drove increased customer requirements for advanced silicon and display products. During this period, Applieds semiconductor customers increased both high volume production and leading edge 65nm and 45nm chip development. Results for this period also reflected Applieds continued focus on cost controls. Improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with real estate and facilities disinvestment that commenced during the first fiscal quarter, equity based compensation expenses and an in process research and development expense associated with the acquisition of Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films). During the second half of fiscal 2006, Applied completed certain transactions in support of its long term growth strategy. Management believes that these transactions will enhance Applieds ability to extend its nanomanufacturing capabilities into adjacent and new markets, including color filters for flat panel displays, solar cells, flexible electronics, energy efficient glass and track solutions for semiconductor manufacturing. These transactions included the acquisition of Applied Films, the formation of a joint venture with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Screen), and the purchase of certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from UMS Solutions Pte. Ltd. (UMS Solutions), a wholly owned subsidiary of Norelco UMS Holdings Limited. Applieds long term opportunities depend in part on successful execution of its growth strategy, including increasing market share in existing markets, expanding into related markets, and cultivating new markets and new business models. These opportunities are also subject to many factors, including: (1) global economic conditions; (2) advanced technology and or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and their capital investment trends; (3) the profitability of chip and display manufacturers; (4) supply and demand for chips, flat panel displays, solar panels, and related products and services; (5) realization of the anticipated benefits of business combinations; (6) continued investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E); and (7) the relative competitiveness of Applieds equipment and service products. For these and other reasons set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Applieds prior results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Results of Operations Net Sales Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a result of these conditions, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and flat panel supply and demand and other factors, including rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. 25 Table of Contents Quarterly and full fiscal year financial information was as follows: Fiscal Quarter Fiscal First Second Third Fourth Year (In millions, except per share amounts) 2004: New orders $ 1,683 $ 2,214 $ 2,462 $ 2,623 $ 8,982 Net sales $ 1,556 $ 2,018 $ 2,236 $ 2,203 $ 8,013 Gross margin $ 676 $ 939 $ 1,059 $ 1,027 $ 3,701 Net income $ 82 $ 373 $ 441 $ 455 $ 1,351 Earnings per share $ 0.05 $ 0.22 $ 0.26 $ 0.27 $ 0.78 2005: New orders $ 1,675 $ 1,553 $ 1,468 $ 1,693 $ 6,389 Net sales $ 1,781 $ 1,861 $ 1,632 $ 1,718 $ 6,992 Gross margin $ 790 $ 818 $ 717 $ 761 $ 3,086 Net income $ 289 $ 305 $ 370 $ 246 $ 1,210 Earnings per share $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.23 $ 0.15 $ 0.73 2006: New orders $ 2,041 $ 2,488 $ 2,670 $ 2,688 $ 9,888 Net sales $ 1,858 $ 2,248 $ 2,543 $ 2,518 $ 9,167 Gross margin $ 838 $ 1,045 $ 1,223 $ 1,186 $ 4,292 Net income $ 143 $ 413 $ 512 $ 449 $ 1,517 Earnings per share $ 0.09 $ 0.26 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ 0.97 Net sales by geographic region, which were attributed to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Taiwan $ 2,006 $ 1,608 $ 2,079 North America(1) 1,337 1,472 1,708 Korea 879 1,021 1,699 Japan 1,417 1,396 1,518 Asia Pacific(2) 1,580 612 1,157 Europe 794 883 1,006 $ 8,013 $ 6,992 $ 9,167 (1) Primarily the United States. (2) Includes China. New orders increased to $9.0 billion for fiscal 2004, reflecting a broad based increase in capital investment in 300mm technology to meet rising demand for chips and flat panel displays. Following the new order trends, net sales increased to $8.0 billion in fiscal 2004, reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior quarters to support customers manufacturing capacity expansion and new technology requirements. New orders for fiscal 2005 decreased 29 percent, from $9.0 billion in the prior year to $6.4 billion, as semiconductor manufacturers reduced their capital investments to align inventories with demand. Following the trend of decreasing orders during fiscal 2005, net sales decreased by 13 percent from $8.0 billion for fiscal 2004 to $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005, reflecting lower demand for semiconductor products. 26 Table of Contents New orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent, from $6.4 billion in the prior year to $9.9 billion, as customer demand increased. Following the trend of increasing orders during fiscal 2006, net sales increased by 31 percent, from $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005 to $9.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from 46.2 percent for fiscal 2004 to 44.1 percent for fiscal 2005, and increased to 46.8 percent for fiscal 2006. The higher gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 was principally attributable to improved revenue levels, changes in product mix, decreased product costs, and increased manufacturing volume, resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts. The higher gross margin in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a result of improved operating performance. The decrease in gross margin from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due to lower revenue levels, lower manufacturing absorption and changes in product mix, which were partially offset by initiatives for cost reduction and efficiency improvement, such as common platform architecture and parts, lower cost sourcing and cycle time reduction. The increase in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was principally attributable to the combination of higher revenue levels, decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume and absorption, partially offset by increased variable and equity based compensation costs. Applied began recognizing expenses associated with stock options and the ESPP in fiscal 2006. Gross margin during fiscal 2006 included $37 million of equity based compensation expense. Research, Development and Engineering Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. As a result, RD&E expenses were $992 million (12 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2004, $941 million (13 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2005, and $1.2 billion (13 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2006. Equity based compensation expenses during fiscal 2006 associated with research, development and engineering functions totaled $76 million. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product or a new product. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2004, Applied continued its investment in developing technologies for future generation manufacturing. Advances were made in several key areas, including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect performance. In fiscal 2005, Applied focused on developing systems for customers advanced chip designs, including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries and flat panel display systems to process larger glass substrates. In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and 22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face as they transition to future device generations, helping them to bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk. Applied also continued to focus on developing flat panel display systems to process even larger glass substrates. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an in process research and development (IPR&D) expense in the amount of $14 million related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applieds methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPR&D was determined through established valuation techniques. The IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. No IPR&D charges were recorded in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, Applied recorded an IPR&D expense in the amount of $6 million related to the acquisition of Torrex Equipment Corporation. 27 Table of Contents Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were $752 million (9 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2004, decreased to $697 million (10 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2005, and increased to $907 million (10 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating expenses from fiscal 2004 to 2005 was due to lower business volume. Operating expenses were affected by reductions in variable compensation due to lower operating performance and focus on cost controls. The increase from fiscal 2005 to 2006 correlated to the increase in business volume, as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance, equity based compensation expense, and spending on the Companys business transformation initiative, partially offset by savings resulting from Applieds continued focus on controlling its overall cost structure. Equity based compensation expenses during fiscal 2006 associated with marketing, sales and general and administrative functions totaled $104 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied launched the planning stage of its multi year business transformation initiative, which is expected to include the design of certain new company wide business processes and the transition to a single vendor software system to perform various functions, such as order management and manufacturing control. Restructuring and Asset Impairments Restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2004 were intended to better align Applieds cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the time. These actions, which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume, reduced Applieds global workforce and consolidated global facilities. Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges for fiscal 2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of $65 million for facility consolidations, $6 million for severance and benefits, and $96 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations. As of October 29, 2006, the fiscal 2004 restructuring actions were completed, and restructuring reserve balances consisted principally of remaining lease commitments associated with facilities. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applieds Board of Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of Applieds real estate and facilities portfolio (the Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of $56 million were reported as assets held for sale and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied recorded an asset impairment charge of $124 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to write down the following properties to estimated fair value: (1) facilities in Narita, Japan; Chunan, Korea; Hillsboro, Oregon; Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. As part of the Plan, Applied also recorded a charge in the amount of $91 million for future lease obligations that were scheduled to continue through fiscal 2014 related to the closure of its leased Hayward, California facility. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied sold the Danvers, Massachusetts facility for net proceeds of $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied recorded additional impairment charges on the Narita and Chunan facilities of $6 million and recorded a restructuring charge of $4 million related to environmental contamination of the Narita site. During the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, Applied consumed $9 million in restructuring reserves related to the Hayward campus in rental and operating costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Hayward lease obligation was terminated for $81 million. Applied continues to actively market the remaining properties. For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation Settlements, Net Litigation settlements, net were $27 million for fiscal 2004 and consisted of costs of $28 million related to two separate patent litigation settlements, net of a gain of $1 million related to a legal settlement in favor of Applied. During fiscal 2005 and 2006, there were no material litigation settlements. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $66 million for fiscal 2004, $134 million for fiscal 2005 and $149 million for fiscal 2006. The increases in net interest income from fiscal 2004 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2006 were due primarily to a 28 Table of Contents substantial increase in interest rates combined with a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in September 2004 and September 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied repurchased 145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under an accelerated buyback program. The repurchase was funded with Applieds existing cash and investments. A portion of the investment portfolio was sold to fund the accelerated stock buyback, resulting in lower interest income due to the realization of losses associated with certain investments and a reduced investment portfolio. Income Taxes Applieds effective income tax provision rate was 26.1 percent for fiscal 2004, 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 and 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006. Applieds effective rate of 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings of $118 million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of $14 million, partially offset by a charge of $32 million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act). Applieds effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of $61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $17 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. The Jobs Creation Act, enacted in fiscal 2004, provides for a three year phase out of current extraterritorial income tax (ETI) benefits and replaces ETI with a phased in nine percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully effective until 2010. The Jobs Creation Act will not fully replace Applieds current ETI tax benefits. Applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income, and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly. Segment Information After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and, as a result, is reporting four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future changes to Applieds internal financial reporting structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses which are reported separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include equity based compensation, regional marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and RD&E costs) and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy costs. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one reportable segment. Fiscal 2004 and 2005 amounts are presented on a basis comparable to fiscal 2006 amounts. Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment. Silicon Segment Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 6,363 $ 3,918 $ 6,555 Net sales $ 5,767 $ 4,468 $ 5,971 Operating income $ 1,832 $ 1,105 $ 2,000 Fiscal 2004 Silicon orders of $6.4 billion reflected investment in advanced 300mm manufacturing capacity by chip manufacturers due to robust consumer spending, increased corporate information technology spending and growth in the personal computer and cell phone markets. During fiscal 2004, net sales of $5.8 billion reflected increased demand for Applieds low k CVD Black products, and PECVD, CMP and PVD products continued to be industry benchmarks for performance and capability in advanced technologies. During fiscal 2004, operating income of $1.8 billion reflected higher net sales and cost savings related to completion of the realignment plan, 29 Table of Contents offset in part by higher variable compensation expenses. In fiscal 2004, RD&E advances were made in several key areas, including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect performance. Ten major products were introduced, including the Applied Endura2, Applied Reflexion LK Ecmp, Applied Producer HARP, Applied Quantum X and Applied SEMVision G2 FIB systems, all targeted for 65nm and below chip manufacturing. Silicon orders of $3.9 billion decreased 38 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Net sales of $4.5 billion decreased 23 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 was a year of lower semiconductor capital equipment investment, as customers aligned inventories with demand. During fiscal 2005, customers decreased manufacturing utilization to address rising chip inventory and softening end user demand. Operating income of $1.1 billion decreased 40 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, Applied reduced variable expenses and the cost of products sold in order to align its cost structure with market conditions. In fiscal 2005, RD&E focused on developing systems for customers advanced chip designs, including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries. For copper interconnect applications, the Company introduced the Applied Endura CuB/S II system with advanced copper barrier/seed technology and the Applied Producer Black Diamond II system for next generation low k dielectric film layers. For leading edge transistor gate applications, the Company launched the Applied Centura AdvantEdge Etch system, Applied Siconitm preclean technology and the Applied Vantage RadOx RTP. New applications in strain engineering, which involves creating localized areas of stress in the transistor structure, were also developed for existing systems to meet customers requirements for faster transistors. In the area of inspection and metrology, the Company launched the Applied UVisiontm system, the industrys first laser 3D brightfield inspection tool, and Applied OPC Check software, designed to automate critical OPC mask verification. Silicon orders of $6.6 billion increased 67 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, leading semiconductor manufacturers reported increased sales as the electronics market continued to grow. The demand for consumer electronics, including broadband, personal computers and cell phones with increasing digital content and complex chips, resulted in increased chip demand and the need for new capacity. In addition to expanding consumer electronics demand, corporate information technology investment increased, with an emphasis on security, server consolidation and more robust internet infrastructures. Net sales of $6.0 billion increased 34 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, demand increased in many areas, including etch, inspection and thin films products. Operating income of $2.0 billion increased 81 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Improved operating results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume, offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses. In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM devices. To extend aluminum (the material used by many memory manufacturers for interconnects) to the sub 70nm node, the Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura CVD Al technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch system. For faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its enhanced Endura CuBS system with Aktiv Preclean, extending the systems capability to the 45nm node and below, especially for use with ultra low k dielectric films. The Company introduced the Applied Endura iLB II (integrated liner barrier) system, offering advances in PVD titanium and preclean technologies, to provide significantly reduced resistance for contact structures. The Company also focused on providing solutions to extend customers lithography technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF e (advanced patterning film enhancement) system. The new APF e film enables chipmakers to cost effectively pattern nano scale features without additional integration complexity while reducing their reliance on next generation lithography systems. Fab Solutions Segment Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 1,779 $ 1,713 $ 2,259 Net sales $ 1,675 $ 1,768 $ 2,210 Operating income $ 394 $ 400 $ 623 Fiscal 2004 orders and net sales reflected increased demand for spare parts due to higher wafer starts, a growing installed base, and increased demand for remanufactured equipment. During fiscal 2004, operating income of $394 million reflected higher net sales and savings related to cost control initiatives. 30 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 orders of $1.7 billion decreased 4 percent compared to fiscal 2004, reflecting customers cost reduction initiatives and lower remanufactured systems orders, offset in part by a modest increase in wafer starts. Fiscal 2005 net sales and operating income included Metron, which Applied acquired in December 2004, expanding the product and service portfolio with a wide range of outsourcing solutions. Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 6 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income of $400 million increased 1 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and included Metron integration costs. Applied also expanded its product portfolio with the addition of abatement systems, FAB300 manufacturing execution systems, products for assembly and test, kitting and cleaning, and other technology focused fab offerings. Orders of $2.3 billion increased 32 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales of $2.2 billion increased 25 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales reflected increases in spare parts shipments and service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment. Operating income of $623 million increased 56 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, operating results reflected improved operational efficiencies and savings from cost control initiatives. Applied also expanded its product offerings with the introduction of abatement systems for reducing perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions and additional chamber performance services capabilities. Display Segment Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 840 $ 758 $ 1,037 Net sales $ 571 $ 756 $ 966 Operating income $ 177 $ 254 $ 319 Fiscal 2004 orders, net sales and operating income reflected increased end user demand for LCD TVs and laptop displays. Demand also increased for small panels, driven by mobile phones with enhanced capabilities, such as color displays, cameras, larger screen sizes and higher resolutions. Operating income included RD&E expenses related to the development of the Gen 7 system. Seventh generation TFT LCD substrates measure 1.8m x 2.2m and produce up to six 46 inch large screen displays. Orders of $758 million decreased 10 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 orders reflected a lower demand for smaller panel equipment, offset in part by orders for Gen 7.5 systems as manufacturers migrated to larger sized TFT LCD display production. Net sales of $756 million increased 32 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income of $254 million increased 43 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 results included higher RD&E expenses. Applied introduced the Gen 8 AKT 50K PECVD system for manufacturing flat panel displays. This system processes 2.2m x 2.4m glass substrates for producing up to six 52 inch LCD screens. Orders of $1.0 billion increased 37 percent in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, price reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth of the TFT LCD display market. As a result, display manufacturers aggressively invested in Gen 7, Gen 7.5, and Gen 8 systems. In addition, laptop demand continued to be strong, resulting in additional Gen 5 and Gen 5.5 fab investment. With the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006, Applied entered the PVD color filter market. Net sales of $1.0 billion increased 28 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory levels. Operating income of $319 million increased 25 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Fiscal 2006 results included a $5 million IPR&D expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applied launched three FPD systems, the AKT 55K EBT, the AKT 55K PECVD and the AKT NEW ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen 8.5 panels, sized at 2.2m x 2.5m, which produce up to six 55 inch LCD screens. 31 Table of Contents Adjacent Technologies Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) New orders $ $ $ 37 Net sales $ $ $ 20 Operating loss $ $ $ 8 Orders and net sales in fiscal 2006 reflected the results of Applied Films solar, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass products that Applied acquired in the third quarter. Fiscal 2006 results included a $9 million IPR&D expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Business Combinations and Equity Method Investment On August 14, 2006, Applieds wholly owned subsidiary, Metron Technology, Inc., purchased certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from UMS Solutions for $10 million. The acquisition enhances Metrons capabilities in Southeast Asia to provide advanced, high quality parts cleaning services to support its customers semiconductor manufacturing requirements. On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo Co., Ltd. (Sokudo), a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced track solutions for customers critical semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Track systems are a key part of semiconductor manufacturing and are used before and after photolithography to deposit, bake and develop the photoresist layer that defines circuit patterns. Screen owns 52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns 48 percent of Sokudo. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing track business and related intellectual property, including employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo. Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology and related intellectual property and will provide key development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo under an outsourcing agreement. On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of Applied Films, a leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment used in manufacturing flat panel displays (FPDs), solar cells, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films for a total purchase price of approximately $484 million, or $328 million net of Applied Films existing cash and marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied assumed Applied Films outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards that, at the acquisition date, had a total fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was allocated to the purchase price and the remainder to unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and subject to vesting, Applied Films stock options became exercisable for shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films restricted stock awards became payable in shares of Applied common stock totaling, in the aggregate, three million shares of Applied common stock. On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc.

ChemTrace provides customers with precision parts cleaning and materials testing solutions. On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP Global Technology, Inc. (SCP), consisting of single wafer HF last immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry intellectual property, for approximately $24 million in cash. On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI, Inc.s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supports the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for semiconductor manufacturing and other industrial applications, for approximately $16 million in cash. On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology N.V., a provider of a range of products and services for fab wide operations, for approximately $85 million in cash. 32 Table of Contents On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex Equipment Corporation, a developer of a multi wafer system that utilizes chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition processes to address front end semiconductor manufacturing applications, for $7 million in cash. For further details, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an entity to recognize in its statement of financial condition the funded status of its defined benefit post retirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS 158 also requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to the extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components of periodic net benefit cost. SFAS 158 is effective for Applied in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 becomes effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 157 on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for Applied in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect the implementation of this staff accounting bulletin to have a material effect on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for Applied beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of FIN 48 on its financial position and results of operations. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS 155 also resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. SFAS 155 (a) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, (b) clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133, (c) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, (d) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and (e) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of Applieds 2007 fiscal year. Applied is currently assessing the 33 Table of Contents impact of SFAS 155, however, it does not anticipate that SFAS 155 will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154), which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on Applieds financial position or results of operations. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased from $6.0 billion at October 30, 2005 to $3.2 billion at October 29, 2006 due primarily to share repurchases and cash dividend distributions. Applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years. Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 30, October 29, 2005 2006 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 990 $ 861 Short term investments 2,343 1,036 Long term investments 2,652 1,315 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 5,985 $ 3,212 During fiscal 2006, Applied changed its accounting method for certain fixed income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of these investments from short term investments to long term investments. As a result, prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. This accounting method is based on the contractual maturity dates of fixed income securities as current or long term, while the prior classification was based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations. Applied believes this presentation method is preferable as it is more reflective of Applieds assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed income investments of $2.6 billion have been reclassified from short term investments to long term investments in the October 30, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006 financial statement presentation. In connection with this reclassification, short term deferred taxes have been reclassified to long term deferred taxes. There have been no changes in Applieds investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting method. In addition, $50 million of long term equity securities previously reported in other long term assets have been reclassified to long term investments in the October 30, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006 financial statement presentation. Applied continues to classify auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes as current assets, notwithstanding the underlying contractual term of such investments, since the highly liquid nature of these investments enables them to be readily convertible to cash. Applied generated cash from operating activities of $1.6 billion for fiscal 2004, $1.2 billion for fiscal 2005 and $1.9 billion for fiscal 2006. The primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, equity based compensation, asset impairments and restructuring and IPR&D expenses, and changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable and inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of $859 million for fiscal 2004, $158 million for fiscal 2005 and $245 million for fiscal 2006. The sales of these accounts receivable increased cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding. Days sales outstanding were 69 days at the end of fiscal 2004, compared to 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005 and 80 days at the end of fiscal 2006. A portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse provisions. However, Applied has not experienced any losses under these programs. Availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale agreements depend on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of such arrangements. The decrease in days sales outstanding in fiscal 2006 is primarily related to the change in the regional sales mix and 34 Table of Contents the resulting relative increase in the amount of sold accounts receivable. For further details regarding accounts receivable sales, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories increased by $373 million in fiscal 2006, which related to the increase in business volume and sales activity from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Applied used $534 million of cash for investing activities for fiscal 2004, $179 million for fiscal 2005, and generated $2.0 billion during fiscal 2006. Applieds investing activities included purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, of $336 million for fiscal 2004. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $122 million for fiscal 2005 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2006. Proceeds from the sale of investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to fund Applieds accelerated stock buyback. Capital expenditures were $191 million for fiscal 2004, $200 million for fiscal 2005, and $179 million for fiscal 2006, totaling $570 million for the past three years. The majority of capital spending was for application laboratories, equipment and related facilities. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and demonstration equipment. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included investment in laboratory equipment and upgrades to Applieds enterprise resource planning software and network architecture. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and $18 million to purchase three buildings in Santa Clara, California that Applied had previously leased. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2005, Applied paid $102 million, net of cash acquired, for the Metron and EcoSys acquisitions. During fiscal 2006, Applied paid cash for acquisitions and the investment in a joint venture totaling $486 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied acquired the outstanding stock of Applied Films for $310 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and assumed equity awards with a fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was included in the purchase price; formed a joint venture, Sokudo, with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Ltd. for which Applied paid $147 million in cash and contributed other assets; acquired certain assets of UMS Solutions for $10 million; and acquired ChemTrace for approximately $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Applied used cash of $359 million for financing activities for fiscal 2004, $1.6 billion for fiscal 2005 and $4.1 billion for 2006. Financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its equity based employee benefit and incentive plans. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $650 million for fiscal 2004, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2005 and $4.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2005, Applieds Board of Directors declared four consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.03 per share each. The first two declared cash dividends totaling $98 million were paid during fiscal 2005. Beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2006, Applieds Board declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.05 per share each. Cash dividends declared, totaling $251 million, were paid during fiscal 2006. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors. Financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt. Applied did not borrow any cash in fiscal years 2004, 2005 or 2006. During fiscal 2006, Applied entered into a $100 million 364 day unsecured credit agreement, which replaced a $250 million credit facility that expired during the year. Cash used for debt repayments totaled $105 million for fiscal 2004, $62 million for fiscal 2005 and $8 million for fiscal 2006. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to Applieds equity compensation programs totaled $397 million for fiscal 2004, $266 million for fiscal 2005 and $361 million for fiscal 2006. On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs) under which Applied agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of Applieds outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased from Goldman Sachs 145 million shares of Applieds common stock on September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20 and Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following four months. At the end of the four month period, Applied is entitled or subject to a price adjustment with Goldman Sachs based upon the volume weighted average price of Applied common stock during the purchase period. The price adjustment, if any, may be settled, at Applieds option, in cash or shares of its common stock. The 35 Table of Contents repurchase was funded with Applieds existing cash and investments. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2006, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 29, 2006, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $114 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $88 million for fiscal 2004, $87 million for fiscal 2005 and $70 million for fiscal 2006. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 29, 2006: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 407 $ 203 $ 3 $ 1 $ 200 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 172 28 29 29 86 Operating lease obligations 173 60 72 25 16 Purchase obligations* 1,237 1,186 51 Other long term liabilities 189 118 16 10 45 $ 2,178 $ 1,595 $ 171 $ 65 $ 347 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods; and (c) contractual requirements to pay a penalty if a contract is cancelled. While the amount above represents Applieds purchase agreements as of October 29, 2006, the actual amounts to be paid by Applied may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated, cancelled or terminated. Other Commitments On July 20, 2006, Applied and Screen completed the formation of Sokudo, a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced track solutions for customers critical semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Screen owns 52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns 48 percent. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing track business and related intellectual property, including employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo. Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology and related intellectual property and will provide key development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo under an outsourcing agreement. Applied accounts for its interest in Sokudo under the equity method of accounting. Under this accounting method, Applieds exposure to loss from ongoing 36 Table of Contents operations is limited to $144 million as of October 29, 2006, which represents Applieds carrying value of its investment in Sokudo. Applieds investment in Sokudo is classified as an equity method investment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. 37 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Equity Based Compensation Employee Stock Option Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans Beginning on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), which requires recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation. The fair value of stock options and ESPP shares was estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award, and Applied has elected to use the straight line method. Applied makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. Prior to the implementation of SFAS 123(R), Applied accounted for stock options and ESPP shares under the provisions of APB 25 and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, which amended SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Applieds common stock at the date of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Legal Matters Applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Applied evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss. Significant judgment is required in both the probability 38 Table of Contents determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, significant changes in legal proceedings and claims, or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters, could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk At October 29, 2006, Applieds investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.4 billion. Applieds primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 29, 2006 and October 30, 2005, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $28 million and $65 million, respectively. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired. Applieds long term debt bears interest at fixed rates. As such, Applieds interest expense would increase only to the extent that Applied significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations outstanding. Due to the short term nature and relatively low amount of Applieds variable rate obligations, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, British pound, euro and Israeli shekel. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on Applieds results of operations for fiscal 2004, 2005 or 2006. Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, British pound, euro and Israeli shekel), and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions. Applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Applieds risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at October 29, 2006 were not material.
