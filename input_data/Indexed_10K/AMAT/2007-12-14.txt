MDA consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business, measurements and opportunities. Results of Operations: a discussion of operating results. Segment Information: a discussion of segment operating results. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates. Overview Applied provides Nanomanufacturing Technology solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment, service and software products. Applieds customers include manufacturers of semiconductor chips and wafers, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied reports four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. Product development and manufacturing activities occur in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force. As a supplier to these industries, Applieds results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for integrated circuits, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Applieds business is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes. The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 6,389 $ 9,888 $ 9,677 Net sales $ 6,992 $ 9,167 $ 9,735 Gross margin $ 3,086 $ 4,292 $ 4,492 Gross margin percent 44.1 % 46.8 % 46.1 % Net income $ 1,210 $ 1,517 $ 1,710 Earnings per share $ 0.73 $ 0.97 $ 1.20 Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industrys recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments. Net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong demand from DRAM and Flash memory chip manufacturers, partially offset by a significant decline in LCD equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial growth in 2006. Net income improved in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher sales and lower operating expenses, offset in 22 Table of Contents part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial results included equity based compensation expenses, restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and an in process research and development (IPRD) expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. (Brooks Software). In fiscal 2006, customer demand improved over fiscal 2005, resulting in higher orders and revenue. Fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries and the global economy, as end user demand for electronic products and LCDs drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon (particularly memory) and display products. During this period, Applieds semiconductor customers increased both high volume production and leading edge 65nm and 45nm chip development. Improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with real estate and facilities disinvestment, equity based compensation expenses, and an IPRD expense associated with the acquisition of Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films). Fiscal 2005 financial results reflected a challenging environment as Applieds customers decreased fab utilization globally and reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for chips. In this period, Applied focused on lowering costs, improving efficiencies, reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market. Applied expects a challenging environment for the first part of fiscal 2008. Uncertain economic conditions, including higher energy prices, credit concerns and changes in consumer confidence, have led to reduced demand in the semiconductor equipment industry. As a result, semiconductor equipment customers are expected to invest at levels lower than in 2007, offset in part by the anticipated onset of a recovery in the flat panel display industry and growth in other markets. Results of Operations Quarterly and full fiscal year financial information is as follows: Fiscal Quarter Fiscal First Second Third Fourth Year (In millions, except per share amounts) 2005: New orders $ 1,675 $ 1,553 $ 1,468 $ 1,693 $ 6,389 Net sales $ 1,781 $ 1,861 $ 1,632 $ 1,718 $ 6,992 Gross margin $ 790 $ 818 $ 717 $ 761 $ 3,086 Net income $ 289 $ 305 $ 370 $ 246 $ 1,210 Earnings per share $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.23 $ 0.15 $ 0.73 2006: New orders $ 2,041 $ 2,488 $ 2,670 $ 2,688 $ 9,888 Net sales $ 1,858 $ 2,248 $ 2,543 $ 2,518 $ 9,167 Gross margin $ 838 $ 1,045 $ 1,223 $ 1,186 $ 4,292 Net income $ 143 $ 413 $ 512 $ 449 $ 1,517 Earnings per share $ 0.09 $ 0.26 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ 0.97 2007: New orders $ 2,538 $ 2,648 $ 2,284 $ 2,206 $ 9,677 Net sales $ 2,277 $ 2,530 $ 2,561 $ 2,367 $ 9,735 Gross margin $ 1,063 $ 1,137 $ 1,216 $ 1,077 $ 4,492 Net income $ 403 $ 411 $ 474 $ 422 $ 1,710 Earnings per share $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.34 $ 0.30 $ 1.20 Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007. As a result of these conditions, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and 23 Table of Contents across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and LCD supply and demand and other factors, including rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. New Orders New orders by geographic region, which were attributed to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) Taiwan $ 1,549 $ 2,098 $ 2,703 Korea 856 1,758 1,639 Japan 1,295 1,823 1,520 North America(1) 1,279 1,901 1,518 Asia Pacific(2) 566 1,272 1,262 Europe 844 1,036 1,035 $ 6,389 $ 9,888 $ 9,677 (1) Primarily the United States. (2) Includes China. New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and service products. Demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity. LCD customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. New orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent to $9.9 billion from $6.4 billion in the prior year, as customer demand increased. Fiscal 2006 orders reflected increased semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from memory manufacturers, increased service orders as a result of higher customer factory utilization and new product introductions, and increased display orders as customers invested in next generation equipment. New orders for fiscal 2005 decreased to $6.4 billion reflecting a challenging environment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduced their capital investments to align inventories with demand. Applieds backlog for the last three fiscal years was as follows: $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, $3.4 billion at October 29, 2006, and $2.6 billion at October 30, 2005. Backlog consists only of orders for which written authorizations have been accepted, shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned and revenue has not been recognized. Due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods. 24 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales by geographic region, which were attributed to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) Taiwan $ 1,608 $ 2,079 $ 2,679 Korea 1,021 1,699 1,847 North America(1) 1,472 1,708 1,554 Japan 1,396 1,518 1,493 Asia Pacific(2) 612 1,157 1,206 Europe 883 1,006 956 $ 6,992 $ 9,167 $ 9,735 (1) Primarily the United States. (2) Includes China. During fiscal 2007, net sales increased by 6 percent, from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006 to $9.7 billion in fiscal 2007, led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year. In fiscal 2006, following the trend of increasing orders that year, net sales increased by 31 percent, from $7.0 billion in fiscal 2005 to $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, net sales of $7.0 billion reflected lower demand for semiconductor products. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 46.1 percent in fiscal 2007 from 46.8 percent in fiscal 2006, which was an increase from 44.1 percent in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to inventory related charges of $56 million associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, incremental charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, amortization, and product mix, partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower material costs. Gross margin during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included $37 million and $27 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. The increase in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was principally attributable to the combination of higher revenue levels, decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume and absorption, partially offset by increased variable and equity based compensation costs. Applied began recognizing expenses associated with stock options and the ESPP in fiscal 2006. Research, Development and Engineering Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RDE to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in RDE in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. RDE expenses were $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion (13 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2006, and $941 million (13 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2005. RDE expense during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included $76 million and $56 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for customers new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k metal gates, and 25 Table of Contents patterning processes that will enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also continued to invest in solar research and development. In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and 22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face as they transition to future device generations, helping them to bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk. Applied also continued to focus on developing LCD systems to process larger glass substrates. In fiscal 2005, Applied focused on developing systems for customers advanced chip designs, including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries, and LCD systems to process larger glass substrates. During fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPRD expense of $5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Software. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an IPRD expense in the amount of $14 million related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applieds methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPRD was determined through established valuation techniques. The IPRD was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. No IPRD charges were recorded in fiscal 2005. Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were $952 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007, $907 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2006, and $697 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2005. The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from acquired businesses, investments in the solar business expansion, and increased variable compensation expenses. These expenses were partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses and savings from cost control initiatives, including ceasing development of beamline implant products and transitioning to managed service providers to perform certain information technology and business infrastructure support. Marketing, sales and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 and 2007 included $104 million and $77 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. The increase from fiscal 2005 to 2006 correlated to the increase in business volume, as well as increases in variable compensation as a result of improved operating performance, equity based compensation expense, and early spending on Applieds implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system, partially offset by savings resulting from Applieds continued focus on controlling its overall cost structure. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applieds Board of Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of Applieds real estate and facilities portfolio (the Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of $56 million were reported as assets held for sale and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down the following properties to estimated fair value: (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006, Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million. Also in fiscal 2006, as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied recorded lease termination charges in the amount of $89 million related to the closure of its leased Hayward, California facility. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applieds Board of Directors approved a plan (the Plan) to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England. Pursuant to the Plan, Applied closed its research, development and manufacturing operations in Horsham in October 2007. The total cost of implementing the Plan is expected to be in the range of $95 million to $110 million, and is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under cost of 26 Table of Contents products sold and operating expenses (including restructuring and asset impairment charges). The majority of the cash outlays in connection with the Plan occurred in fiscal 2007. Costs under the Plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of inventory related charges reported as cost of products sold of $56 million, other operating expenses of $10 million, and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $30 million. Also as part of the Plan, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $22 million, consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce by approximately 215 positions. The majority of the affected employees were based in Horsham, England, and represented multiple functions. Asset impairment charges included $8 million of fixed asset write offs. The Implant group operated in the Silicon segment, and the results of its operations were not material to Applieds financial position or results of operations. For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $98 million for fiscal 2007, $149 million for fiscal 2006, and $134 million for fiscal 2005. The decrease in net interest income from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, when Applied repurchased 145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under an accelerated stock buyback program. On January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of $132 million relating to the accelerated stock buyback program by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs Co. (Goldman Sachs), resulting in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was funded with Applieds existing cash and investments. A portion of the investment portfolio was sold to fund the accelerated stock buyback, resulting in lower interest income in 2007. The increase in net interest income from fiscal 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to increased interest rates combined with a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in September 2004 and September 2005. Income Taxes Applieds effective income tax provision rate was 29.9 percent for fiscal 2007, 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006, and 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005. Applieds effective tax rate of 29.9 percent for fiscal 2007 reflected benefits of $36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $13 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. Applieds effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of $61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $17 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. Applieds effective rate of 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings of $118 million and a change in estimate with respect to export tax benefits of $14 million, partially offset by a charge of $32 million relating to the distribution of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act). Applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income, and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly. Segment Information After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and, as a result, operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future changes to Applieds internal financial reporting structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include equity based compensation and certain components of variable compensation, corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and RDE), and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy costs. Prior to the fourth quarter of 27 Table of Contents fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one reportable segment. Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment. Silicon Segment The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), deposition, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection. Development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges, including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning, and on reducing chip manufacturing costs. A significant portion of fiscal 2007 demand was attributable to a growing market for consumer products with greater memory content. Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 3,918 $ 6,555 $ 6,651 Net sales $ 4,468 $ 5,971 $ 6,512 Operating income $ 1,105 $ 2,000 $ 2,379 Silicon orders of $6.7 billion increased 1 percent in fiscal 2007, compared to $6.6 billion in fiscal 2006, reflecting the semiconductor industrys strength during this period, driven by demand for cell phones, digital TVs, game consoles, MP3 players and other electronic products. The majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers invested in leading edge Flash and DRAM memory devices, while orders from foundries remained at low levels. Net sales increased 9 percent to $6.5 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to $6.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales was due to increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in multiple areas, including etch, inspection, and RTP products. Operating income increased 19 percent to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was due to higher revenue levels and continued focus on cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges of $66 million related to ceasing development of beamline implant products. In fiscal 2006, the Company launched the Applied Producer GT, a significant redesign of its successful Producer platform that offers faster, more cost effective CVD processing for 45 nm and beyond applications. To meet the challenges of fabricating next generation transistors, Applied announced its portfolio of high k/metal gate solutions, including the Applied Advanced Gate Stack and Applied Centura Carina Etch systems. Other new etch systems introduced were the Applied Mariana Trench, for etching high aspect ratio structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch with a new 5 chamber platform, and the Applied Centura Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch. The Company also added to its line of lithography enabling systems with the new Applied Producer ACE SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with the Applied Producer Celera CVD. In fiscal 2006, Silicon orders of $6.6 billion increased 67 percent compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, leading semiconductor manufacturers reported increased sales as the electronics market continued to grow. The demand for consumer electronics, including broadband, personal computers and cell phones with increasing digital content and complex chips, resulted in increased chip demand and the need for additional capacity. In addition to expanding consumer electronics demand, corporate information technology investment increased, with an emphasis on security, server consolidation and more robust internet infrastructures. Net sales of $6.0 billion increased 34 percent in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, demand increased in many areas, including etch, inspection and thin films products. Operating income of $2.0 billion increased 81 percent in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Improved operating results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume, offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses. In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM devices. To extend the usefulness of aluminum (the material used by many memory manufacturers for interconnects) to the sub 70nm node, the Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura CVD Al technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch system. For faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its enhanced Endura CuBS/S II system with Aktiv Preclean, extending the systems capability to the 45nm node and below, especially for use with ultra low dielectric constant (low k) films. The Company introduced the Applied Endura iLB II (integrated liner barrier) system, offering advances in PVD titanium and preclean technologies, to provide significantly reduced resistance for contact structures. The Company also focused on providing solutions to extend customers lithography technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF e (advanced patterning film enhancement) system. The new 28 Table of Contents APF e film enables chipmakers to cost effectively pattern nano scale features without additional integration complexity while reducing their reliance on next generation lithography systems. In fiscal 2005, Silicon orders of $3.9 billion and net sales of $4.5 billion reflected lower semiconductor capital equipment investment. During the year, customers decreased manufacturing utilization to address rising chip inventory and softening end user demand. Operating income of $1.1 billion reflected Applieds reduction in variable expenses and cost of products sold in order to align its cost structure with market conditions. In fiscal 2005, RDE focused on developing systems for customers advanced chip designs, including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries. For copper interconnect applications, the Company introduced the Applied Endura CuB/S II system with advanced copper barrier/seed technology and the Applied Producer Black Diamond II system for next generation low k dielectric film layers. For leading edge transistor gate applications, the Company launched the Applied Centura AdvantEdge Etch system, Applied Siconitm preclean technology and the Applied Vantage RadOx RTP. New applications in strain engineering, which involves creating localized areas of stress in the transistor structure, were also developed for existing systems to meet customers requirements for faster transistors. In the area of inspection and metrology, the Company launched the Applied UVisiontm system, the industrys first laser 3D brightfield inspection tool, and Applied OPC Check software, designed to automate critical OPC mask verification. Fab Solutions Segment The Fab Solutions segment includes products to improve the productivity and operating efficiency and lessen the environmental impact of customers factories, and includes spares and remanufactured equipment sales. Customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites. This business is focused on expanding with technically differentiated new products that improve fab productivity, reduce fab operation costs, and enable customers to decrease the environmental impact of manufacturing. Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 1,713 $ 2,259 $ 2,374 Net sales $ 1,768 $ 2,210 $ 2,196 Operating income $ 400 $ 623 $ 572 Orders of $2.4 billion increased 5 percent in fiscal 2007, compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in orders reflected increased demand for spare parts and services, as well as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007 were slightly down compared to fiscal 2006 and reflected declines in spares parts sales, offset by increased factory automation sales. Fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income decreased 8 percent to $572 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $623 million in fiscal 2006, reflecting product mix and increased operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks Software acquisition. In fiscal 2006, orders of $2.3 billion increased 32 percent compared to fiscal 2005. Net sales of $2.2 billion increased 25 percent compared to fiscal 2005. Net sales reflected increases in spare parts shipments and service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment. Operating income of $623 million increased 56 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, operating results reflected improved operational efficiencies and savings from cost control initiatives. Applied also expanded its product offerings with the introduction of abatement systems for reducing perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions and additional chamber performance services capabilities. Fiscal 2005 orders of $1.7 billion reflected customers cost reduction initiatives and lower remanufactured systems orders, offset in part by a modest increase in wafer starts. Fiscal 2005 net sales were $1.8 billion and operating income was $400 million. Applied expanded its product portfolio with the addition of abatement systems, FAB300 manufacturing execution systems, products for assembly and test, kitting and cleaning, and other technology focused fab offerings. 29 Table of Contents Display Segment The Display segment encompasses products and services for manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other video enabled devices. Applied is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with larger scale substrates, entry into new markets, and development of products to enable cost reductions through enhanced productivity and uniformity. The Display segment also developments, manufactures and supports differentiated stand alone equipment for the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line. Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 758 $ 1,037 $ 407 Net sales $ 756 $ 966 $ 862 Operating income $ 254 $ 319 $ 217 Orders decreased 61 percent to $407 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2006, reflecting continued delays in capacity expansion plans by LCD panel makers in light of excess inventories and sales price declines. LCD customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable market conditions. Net sales decreased 11 percent to $862 million in fiscal 2007 from $1.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales was attributable to lower investment by LCD manufacturers as they absorbed capacity. Operating income decreased 32 percent to $217 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $319 million in fiscal 2006, due to lower revenues and factory absorption, product mix and higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition of Applied Films in July 2006. In 2007, Applied launched the AKT PiVottm 55KV system which employs high productivity, cost efficient PVD technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide films on the substrate. In fiscal 2006, orders of $1.0 billion increased 37 percent compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, price reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth of the flat panel display market. As a result, display manufacturers increased investments in Gen 7, Gen 7.5, and Gen 8 systems. In addition, laptop demand continued to be strong, resulting in additional Gen 5 and Gen 5.5 fab investment. With the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006, Applied entered the PVD color filter market. Net sales of $1.0 billion increased 28 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory levels. Operating income of $319 million increased 25 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Fiscal 2006 results included a $5 million IPRD expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applied launched three FPD systems, the AKT 55K EBT, the AKT 55K PECVD and the AKT NEW ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen 8.5 panels, sized at 2.2m x 2.5m, which produce up to six 55 inch LCD TV screens. Fiscal 2005 orders of $758 million reflected lower demand for smaller panel equipment, offset in part by orders for Gen 7.5 systems as manufacturers migrated to larger sized flat panel display production. Net sales and operating income increased to $756 million and $254 million, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results included higher RDE expenses. Applied introduced the Gen 8 AKT 50K PECVD system for manufacturing LCDs. This system processes 2.2m x 2.4m glass substrates for producing up to six 52 inch LCD TV screens. Adjacent Technologies The Adjacent Technologies segment includes products and services for manufacturing solar cells, high throughput roll to roll coating systems for flexible electronics, and energy efficient glass. Applied began offering these products after the acquisition of Applied Films in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied acquired HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT), expanding its solar product offerings. Activities in this segment are focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with the objective to lower the cost to produce solar electricity by providing equipment and services to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency. 30 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 (In millions) New orders $ $ 37 $ 245 Net sales $ $ 20 $ 165 Operating loss $ $ 8 $ 89 New orders of $245 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $37 million in fiscal 2006, due primarily to increased orders of c Si solar, glass and flexible electronics products. Net sales of $165 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $20 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher glass, flexible electronics and solar net sales. Operating loss of $89 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $8 million in fiscal 2006 reflecting increased RDE spending to develop products and services that enable lower cost production of solar energy and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007, Applied introduced the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line, the first integrated production line designed for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using 5.7 square meter glass panels. Orders and net sales in fiscal 2006 reflected the results of Applied Films solar, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass products that Applied acquired in the third quarter. Fiscal 2006 results included a $9 million IPRD expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Business Combinations and Equity Method Investment On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Switzerland based HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired. HCT is the worlds leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in manufacturing c Si substrates for the solar industry. On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for $137 million in cash. Brooks Software is a leading provider of factory management and control software to the semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Its products complement Applieds existing software applications and enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing solution for optimizing fab operations. On August 14, 2006, Applieds wholly owned subsidiary, Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from UMS Solutions PTE Ltd. for $10 million. The acquisition enhanced the Companys capabilities in Southeast Asia to provide advanced, high quality parts cleaning services to support its customers semiconductor manufacturing requirements. On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo Co., Ltd. (Sokudo), a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced track solutions for customers critical semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Track systems are a key part of semiconductor manufacturing and are used before and after photolithography to deposit, bake and develop the photoresist layer that defines circuit patterns. Screen owns 52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns 48 percent of Sokudo. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing track business and related intellectual property, including employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo. Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology and related intellectual property and has provided key development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo under an outsourcing agreement. On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of Applied Films, a leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment used in manufacturing LCDs, solar cells, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films for a total purchase price of approximately $484 million, or $328 million net of Applied Films existing cash and marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied assumed Applied Films outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards that, at the acquisition date, had a total fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was allocated to the purchase price and the remainder to unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and subject to vesting, Applied Films stock options became exercisable for shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films restricted stock unit awards became payable in shares of Applied common stock totaling, in the aggregate, three million shares of Applied common stock. 31 Table of Contents On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc. for $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing. This business provides customers with precision parts cleaning and materials testing solutions. On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP Global Technology, Inc. (SCP), consisting of single wafer, HF last immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry intellectual property, for approximately $24 million in cash. On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI, Inc.s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supported the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial applications, for approximately $16 million in cash. On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology N.V., a provider of a range of products and services for fab wide operations, for approximately $85 million in cash. For further details, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 159 on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 becomes effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 157 on its financial position and results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for Applied beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48. Management does not believe the effect of implementing FIN 48 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments increased from $3.2 billion at October 29, 2006 to $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, due primarily to cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from common stock issuances, offset by share repurchases, cash paid for acquisitions and cash dividend distributions. Applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years. 32 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 29, October 28, 2006 2007 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 861 $ 1,203 Short term investments 1,036 1,167 Long term investments 1,315 1,362 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,212 $ 3,732 Applied generated cash from operating activities of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007, $2.0 billion in fiscal 2006, and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2005. The primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, equity based compensation, asset impairments and restructuring and IPRD expenses, and changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable and inventories. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $431 million in fiscal 2007, $237 million in fiscal 2006, and $145 million in fiscal 2005. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Days sales outstanding were 79 days at the end of fiscal 2007, compared to 80 days at the end of fiscal 2006 and 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in days sales outstanding in fiscal 2007 was primarily related to the change in the regional sales mix. Inventories decreased by $94 million in fiscal 2007, reflecting improved working capital management during a period of increased business volume and sales activity. Applied used $977 million of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2007, generated $1.9 billion of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2006 and used $219 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2005. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $150 million for fiscal 2007. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $2.6 billion in fiscal 2006 and $83 million in fiscal 2005. Proceeds from the sale of investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to fund Applieds accelerated stock buyback. Capital expenditures were $265 million in fiscal 2007, $179 million in fiscal 2006 and $200 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included investment in the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system, and in Applieds new global development capability center in Xian, China. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and three buildings in Santa Clara, California that Applied had previously leased. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included investments in laboratory equipment and upgrades to Applieds enterprise resource planning software and network architecture. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and certain net assets of Brooks Software for $137 million in cash. During fiscal 2006, Applied paid cash for acquisitions and the investment in a joint venture totaling $486 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied acquired the outstanding stock of Applied Films for $310 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired, and assumed equity awards with a fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was included in the purchase price; formed a joint venture, Sokudo, with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Ltd., for which Applied paid $147 million in cash and contributed other assets; acquired certain assets of UMS Solutions for $10 million; and acquired ChemTrace for approximately $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing. During fiscal 2005, Applied paid $102 million, net of cash acquired, for the Metron and EcoSys acquisitions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. On November 19, 2007, Applied entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini), a privately held company based in Italy, for 225 million (or approximately $330 million at the exchange rate at the time of announcement) in cash, which is expected to close in early 2008. Applied used cash of $892 million for financing activities in fiscal 2007, $4.1 billion in fiscal 2006, and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. Financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment 33 Table of Contents of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007, $4.2 billion in fiscal 2006, and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2005. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Applieds Board of Directors declared four consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.03 per share each. The first two declared cash dividends totaling $98 million were paid during fiscal 2005. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Applieds Board declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.05 per share each. Cash dividends totaling $251 million were paid during fiscal 2006. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applieds Board declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.06 per share each. Cash dividends totaling $306 million were paid during fiscal 2007. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of Appliedstockholders. Financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt. Applied did not have any borrowings in fiscal years 2005, 2006 or 2007. As of October 28, 2007, Applied had credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a 5 year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for borrowings at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 28, 2007. No amounts were outstanding under this agreement at October 28, 2007. Cash used for debt repayments totaled $202 million for fiscal 2007, $8 million for fiscal 2006, and $62 million for fiscal 2005. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to Applieds equity compensation programs totaled $948 million for fiscal 2007, $361 million for fiscal 2006, and $266 million for fiscal 2005. On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with Goldman Sachs under which Applied agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of Applieds outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased 145 million shares of its common stock on September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following four months. At the end of the four month period, Applied was entitled or subject to a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of Applied common stock during the purchase period. On January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of $132 million by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs, resulting in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was funded with Applieds existing cash and investments. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock. At October 28, 2007, cash and cash equivalents included an aggregate investment of $147 million in an enhanced cash fund (the Fund). During the period between October 29, 2007 and December 6, 2007, Applied redeemed net $61 million of its investment in the Fund at par value (net of interim transactions). On December 6, 2007, the Funds manager notified Applied that: (1) cash redemptions were temporarily suspended, although redemptions could be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities, consisting principally of high quality corporate debt, mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities; (2) the Funds valuation will be based on the market value of the underlying securities, whereas historically the Funds valuation was based on amortized cost; and (3) interest would continue to accrue. The estimated carrying value of Applieds investment in the Fund at December 6, 2007 was $86 million and is not considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of Fund redemptions. Applied expects to receive a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities in the Fund. Applied anticipates that this redemption will not result in a significant loss. The securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in value depending on market conditions. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 2007, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. 34 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 28, 2007, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $194 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required Applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $62 million for fiscal 2007, $70 million for fiscal 2006, and $87 million for fiscal 2005. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 28, 2007: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 205 $ 3 $ 2 $ $ 200 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 143 14 29 29 71 Operating lease obligations 144 59 61 12 12 Purchase obligations* 1,264 1,263 1 Other long term liabilities 204 8 81 18 97 $ 1,960 $ 1,347 $ 174 $ 59 $ 380 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the 35 Table of Contents application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. 36 Table of Contents The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Legal Matters Applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Applied evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss. Significant judgment is required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, significant changes in legal proceedings and claims, or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters, could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Equity Based Compensation Employee Stock Option Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans Beginning on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which requires recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation. The fair value of stock options and ESPP shares was estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award, and Applied has elected to use the straight line method. Prior to the implementation of SFAS 123(R), Applied accounted for stock options and ESPP shares under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, which amended SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Applieds common stock at the date of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk At October 28, 2007, Applieds investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.6 billion. Applieds primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 28, 2007 and October 29, 2006, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $31 million and $28 million, respectively. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired. All of Applieds debt bears interest at fixed rates. Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 37 Table of Contents 12 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on Applieds results of operations for fiscal 2005, 2006 or 2007. Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions. Applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Applieds risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at October 28, 2007 were not material.
