This MDA should be read in conjunction with Applieds Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business, measurements and opportunities. Results of Operations: a discussion of operating results. Segment Information: a discussion of segment operating results. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates. Overview Applied provides Nanomanufacturing Technologytm solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment, service and software products. Applieds customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic cells and modules (solar PVs), flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Applieds results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Each of Applieds businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes. The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 9,155 $ 9,677 $ 9,888 Net sales $ 8,129 $ 9,735 $ 9,167 Gross margin $ 3,443 $ 4,492 $ 4,292 Gross margin percent 42.4 % 46.1 % 46.8 % Net income $ 961 $ 1,710 $ 1,517 Earnings per share $ 0.70 $ 1.20 $ 0.97 Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory, foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the recognition of orders for Applieds SunFabtm Thin Film Line for manufacturing solar panels. Net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers, partially offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon (c Si) solar manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in part by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. 28 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industrys recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments. Net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong demand from dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory chip manufacturers, partially offset by a significant decline in LCD equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial investment in 2006. Net income improved in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher sales and lower operating expenses, offset in part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial results included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and an in process research and development (IPRD) expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. (Brooks Software). Fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries along with the global economy, as end user demand for electronic products and LCDs drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon (particularly memory) and display products compared to fiscal 2005. During this period, Applieds semiconductor customers increased both high volume production and leading edge 65nm and 45nm chip development. Improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges, and an IPRD expense associated with the acquisition of Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films). Applied expects an unusually challenging environment for fiscal 2009. The turmoil in the financial markets and weakening global economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical markets in which Applied operates. Current negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty have led some customers to decrease factory operations and to reassess their projected spending plans. As a result, on November 12, 2008, Applied announced that it will implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, Applieds ability to forecast customers future investments and its financial targets are limited in this uncertain macroeconomic climate. Applied currently expects that orders and revenue will be down overall and across most segments in fiscal 2009, with the exception of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Results of Operations The following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information: Fiscal Quarter Fiscal First Second Third Fourth Year (In millions, except per share amounts) 2008: New orders $ 2,500 $ 2,414 $ 2,030 $ 2,212 $ 9,155 Net sales $ 2,087 $ 2,150 $ 1,848 $ 2,044 $ 8,129 Gross margin $ 935 $ 967 $ 742 $ 799 $ 3,443 Net income $ 262 $ 303 $ 165 $ 231 $ 961 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.22 $ 0.12 $ 0.17 $ 0.70 2007: New orders $ 2,538 $ 2,648 $ 2,284 $ 2,206 $ 9,677 Net sales $ 2,277 $ 2,530 $ 2,561 $ 2,367 $ 9,735 Gross margin $ 1,063 $ 1,137 $ 1,216 $ 1,077 $ 4,492 Net income $ 403 $ 411 $ 474 $ 422 $ 1,710 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.34 $ 0.30 $ 1.20 2006: New orders $ 2,041 $ 2,488 $ 2,670 $ 2,688 $ 9,888 Net sales $ 1,858 $ 2,248 $ 2,543 $ 2,518 $ 9,167 Gross margin $ 838 $ 1,045 $ 1,223 $ 1,186 $ 4,292 Net income $ 143 $ 413 $ 512 $ 449 $ 1,517 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.09 $ 0.26 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ 0.97 29 Table of Contents Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. As a result of these conditions, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip and LCD supply and demand and other factors, including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. New Orders New orders by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Taiwan $ 2,110 $ 2,703 $ 2,098 North America(1) 1,680 1,518 1,901 Asia Pacific(2) 1,530 1,262 1,272 Korea 1,477 1,639 1,758 Japan 1,224 1,520 1,823 Europe 1,134 1,035 1,036 $ 9,155 $ 9,677 $ 9,888 (1) Primarily the United States. (2) Includes China. New orders for fiscal 2008 decreased 5 percent to $9.2 billion from $9.7 billion in the prior year, due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic, memory, and foundry chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar equipment, including the initial recognition of orders for the Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line. Demand for LCD equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as Display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters. New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor equipment, and service products. Demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity, while demand from LCD customers recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 orders of $9.9 billion reflected increased semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from memory manufacturers, increased service orders as a result of higher customer factory utilization and new product introductions, and increased display orders as customers invested in next generation equipment. Applieds backlog for the last three fiscal years was as follows: $4.8 billion at October 26, 2008, $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, and $3.4 billion at October 29, 2006. Backlog increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of orders for products obtained through the acquisitions of Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini) and HCT Shaping Systems S.A. (HCT) that met Applieds order recognition criteria during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 but did not qualify for order recognition at the time of the acquisition, partially offset by debookings, primarily of semiconductor equipment, and unfavorable currency adjustments. Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods. 30 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Taiwan $ 1,837 $ 2,679 $ 2,079 North America(1) 1,520 1,554 1,708 Korea 1,309 1,847 1,699 Asia Pacific(2) 1,296 1,206 1,157 Japan 1,218 1,493 1,518 Europe 949 956 1,006 $ 8,129 $ 9,735 $ 9,167 (1) Primarily the United States. (2) Includes China. During fiscal 2008, net sales decreased by 16 percent, to $8.1 billion from $9.7 billion in fiscal 2007, due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand from solar and LCD customers. During fiscal 2007, net sales increased by 6 percent, to $9.7 billion from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006, led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year. In fiscal 2006, net sales of $9.2 billion followed the trend of increased orders for the year. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 42.4 percent in fiscal 2008 from 46.1 percent in fiscal 2007, compared to 46.8 percent in fiscal 2006. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net sales and lower margin product mix. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to inventory related charges of $56 million associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, incremental charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, amortization and product mix, partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower material costs. Gross margin during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 included $32 million, $27 million and $37 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Research, Development and Engineering Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RDE to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in RDE in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. RDE expenses were $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008, $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007 and $1.2 billion (13 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2006. RDE expense during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 included $59 million, $56 million and $76 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. Applied pioneered a self aligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for the 31 Table of Contents implementation of through silicon vias, an emerging solution for interconnecting 3D chip stacks to achieve better device performance, lower power consumption, reduced costs and the integration of heterogeneous devices. Efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the cost per watt of solar electricity. In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for customers new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k/metal gate technologies, and patterning processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also continued to invest in solar research and development. In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for flash and DRAM devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and 22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face as they transition to future device generations, helping them to bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk. Applied also continued to focus on developing LCD systems to process larger glass substrates. There were no IPRD charges recorded in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPRD expense of $5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks Automation, Inc. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an IPRD expense in the amount of $14 million related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applieds methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPRD was determined through established valuation techniques. The IPRD was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were $965 million (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008, $952 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007, and $907 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2006. The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2007 to 2008 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from business acquisitions and equity compensation expenses, offset in part by cost control initiatives. The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from acquired businesses, investments in the solar business expansion, and increased variable compensation expenses. These expenses were partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses and savings from cost control initiatives, including ceasing development of beamline implant products and transitioning to managed service providers to perform certain information technology and business infrastructure support. Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 included $88 million, $77 million and $104 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a global cost reduction plan (the Plan) that primarily affected its Silicon and Applied Global Services segments and related support organizations. As part of the Plan, Applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $29 million relating to the Plan, consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce. The affected employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia, and represented multiple functions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applieds Board of Directors approved a plan (the Implant Plan) to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England. Under the Implant Plan, Applied closed its research, development and manufacturing operations in Horsham in October 2007. Costs under the Implant Plan for fiscal 2008 consisted of restructuring charges of $11 million associated with facilities. Costs under the Implant Plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of inventory related charges reported as cost of products sold of $56 million, other operating expenses of $10 million, and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $30 million. Also as part of the Implant Plan, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $22 million, consisting primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce. The majority of the affected employees were based in Horsham, England, and represented multiple functions. Asset impairment charges included $8 million of fixed asset write offs. The Implant group operated in 32 Table of Contents the Silicon segment, and the results of its operations were not material to Applieds financial position or results of operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applieds Board of Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of Applieds real estate and facilities portfolio (the Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of $56 million were reported as assets held for sale and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down the following properties to estimated fair value: (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro, Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006, Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million. Also in fiscal 2006, as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied recorded lease termination charges in the amount of $89 million related to the closure of its leased Hayward, California facility. For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Interest and Other Income Net interest and other income was $89 million for fiscal 2008, $98 million for fiscal 2007, and $149 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease in net interest and other income for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in short term investments and a decrease in interest rates during fiscal 2008, offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in September 2007. The decrease in net interest and other income from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 when Applied repurchased 145 million shares of its outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under an accelerated stock buyback program. Income Taxes Applieds effective income tax provision rate was 31.8 percent for fiscal 2008, 29.9 percent for fiscal 2007, and 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006. Applieds effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected benefits of $36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $13 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. Applieds effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of $61 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $17 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. Applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income, and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly. Segment Information Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include those for equity based compensation and certain components of variable compensation, corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and RDE), and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied renamed two of its reportable segments. The Fab Solutions segment was renamed Applied Global Services, and the Adjacent Technologies segment was renamed Energy and Environmental Solutions. In addition, Applied changed its management reporting system for services to report all service results in the Applied Global Services 33 Table of Contents segment. Applied has reclassified segment operating results for fiscal 2007 and 2006 to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment. Silicon Segment The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection. Development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges, including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning, and on improving chip manufacturing productivity to reduce costs. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 4,092 $ 6,651 $ 6,555 Net sales $ 4,005 $ 6,512 $ 5,971 Operating income $ 1,242 $ 2,379 $ 2,000 Silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic, memory and foundry customers. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers. Operating income decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry, partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost controls and improvement in manufacturing activities. In fiscal 2008, the Company launched two key products for photomask applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask Inspection system, which detects critical defects on a photomask, and the Applied Tetra Reticle Clean system, which cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry. The Company also introduced the Applied Producer eHARP system for depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures. Silicon orders increased 1 percent to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting the semiconductor industrys strength during this period, driven by demand for cell phones, computers, digital TVs, game consoles, MP3 players and other electronic products. The majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers invested in leading edge flash and DRAM memory devices, while orders from foundries remained at low levels. Net sales increased 9 percent to $6.5 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales was due to increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in multiple areas, including etch, inspection, and RTP products. Operating income increased 19 percent to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was due to higher revenue levels and continued focus on cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges of $66 million related to ceasing development of beamline implant products. In fiscal 2007, the Company launched the Applied Producer GT, a significant redesign of its successful Producer platform that offers faster, more cost effective CVD processing for 45 nm and beyond applications. To meet the challenges of fabricating next generation transistors, Applied announced its portfolio of high k/metal gate solutions, including the Applied Advanced Gate Stack and Applied Centura Carina Etch systems. Other new etch systems introduced were the Applied Mariana Trench, for etching high aspect ratio structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch with a new 5 chamber platform, and the Applied Centura Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch. The Company also added to its line of lithography enabling systems with the new Applied Producer ACE SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with the Applied Producer Celera CVD. During fiscal 2006, leading semiconductor manufacturers reported increased sales as the electronics market continued to grow. The demand for consumer electronics, including broadband, personal computers and cell phones with increasing digital content and complex chips, resulted in increased chip demand and the need for additional capacity. In addition to expanding consumer electronics demand, corporate information technology investment increased, with an emphasis on security, server consolidation and more robust internet infrastructures. During 34 Table of Contents fiscal 2006, demand increased in many areas, including etch, inspection and thin films products. Improved operating results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume, offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses. Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip performance, especially for flash and DRAM devices. To extend the usefulness of aluminum (the material used by many memory manufacturers for interconnects) to the sub 70nm node, the Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura CVD Al technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch system. For faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its enhanced Endura CuBS/S II system with Aktiv Preclean, extending the systems capability to the 45nm node and below, especially for use with ultra low dielectric constant (low k) films. The Company introduced the Applied Endura iLB II (integrated liner barrier) system, offering advances in PVD titanium and preclean technologies, to provide significantly reduced resistance for contact structures. The Company also focused on providing solutions to extend customers lithography technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF e (advanced patterning film enhancement) system. The new APF e film enables chipmakers to cost effectively pattern nano scale features without additional integration complexity while reducing their reliance on next generation lithography systems. Applied currently expects that the uncertain economic conditions, including credit concerns and lower consumer spending, will lead to further decline in demand for semiconductor equipment in fiscal 2009. Applied Global Services Segment The Applied Global Services segment encompasses technically differentiated products, including spares, services, certain earlier generation equipment products, and remanufactured equipment, to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating costs, and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers factories. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 2,249 $ 2,508 $ 2,413 Net sales $ 2,329 $ 2,353 $ 2,352 Operating income $ 575 $ 630 $ 685 Fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of semiconductor and display customers factory utilization. New orders decreased 10 percent to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower orders for spares, fab wide services, and refurbished equipment, partially offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements. Net sales decreased 1 percent to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The net sales decrease reflected lower sales of fab wide services and spares, offset by increased sales in services and system enhancements. Operating income decreased 9 percent to $575 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in fiscal 2008. New orders increased 4 percent to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in new orders reflected increased demand for spare parts and services, as well as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2007 were slightly up compared to fiscal 2006 due to increased factory automation sales offset by declines in spares sales. Fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income decreased 8 percent to $630 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting product mix and increased operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales in 2006 reflected increases in spare parts shipments and service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment. During fiscal 2006, operating results reflected improved operational efficiencies and savings from cost control initiatives. Applied also expanded its product offerings with the introduction of abatement systems for reducing perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions and additional chamber performance services capabilities. 35 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders, net sales and operating income increased from the previously reported amounts due to the reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service products from the Display segment. Applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic conditions will lead to lower factory utilization by Applieds customers, resulting in lower demand for Applied Global Services products in fiscal 2009. Display Segment The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other video enabled devices. The business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with larger scale substrates, entry into new markets, and development of products to enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 1,486 $ 273 $ 883 Net sales $ 976 $ 705 $ 824 Operating income $ 310 $ 159 $ 257 New orders increased significantly to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to $273 million in fiscal 2007. Increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by Display customers in response to strong end product demand. This demand for LCD equipment reached an inflexion point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, reflecting the volatility of the display industry. Net sales increased 38 percent to $976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to customers investment in Gen 8 products. Operating income increased to $310 million in fiscal 2008 from $159 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income increased due to higher revenue levels, product mix and lower operating costs. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced its Gen 10 systems that can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These systems include the AKT 90K PECVD and AKT 90K EBT products. New orders decreased 69 percent to $273 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting delays in capacity expansion plans by LCD panel makers in light of excess inventories and end product sales price declines. Display customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable market conditions. Net sales decreased 14 percent to $705 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was attributable to lower investment by LCD manufacturers as they absorbed capacity. Operating income decreased 38 percent to $159 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, due to lower revenues and factory absorption, product mix and higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition of Applied Films in July 2006. In 2007, Applied launched the AKT PiVottm 55KV system, which employs high productivity, cost efficient PVD technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide films on the substrate. During fiscal 2006, price reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth of the flat panel display market. As a result, display manufacturers increased investments in Gen 7, Gen 7.5, and Gen 8 systems. In addition, laptop demand continued to be strong, resulting in additional Gen 5 and Gen 5.5 fab investment. With the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006, Applied entered the PVD color filter market. During the last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory levels. Fiscal 2006 results included a $5 million IPRD expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applied launched three FPD systems, the AKT 55K EBT, the AKT 55K PECVD and the AKT NEW ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen 8.5 panels, sized at 2.2m x 2.5m, which produce up to six 55 inch LCD TV screens. Fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders, net sales and operating income reported herein are lower than the previously reported amounts due to the reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service products from the Display segment to the Applied Global Services segment. 36 Table of Contents Applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic conditions will result in decreasing consumer spending, leading to lower factory utilization by flat panel display manufacturers and lower demand for LCD equipment in fiscal 2009. Energy and Environmental Solutions Segment The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products for fabricating solar PV cells and modules, high throughput roll to roll coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and systems used in the manufacture of energy efficient glass. Applied began offering these products after the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006. This segment also includes products for manufacturing c Si solar PVs that were obtained through the acquisitions of HCT in fiscal 2007 and Baccini in fiscal 2008. This business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) New orders $ 1,329 $ 245 $ 37 Net sales $ 819 $ 165 $ 20 Operating loss $ 183 $ 89 $ 8 New orders of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was primarily due to the recognition of orders for the Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as well as growth in orders for c Si products. Net sales of $819 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $165 million in fiscal 2007 due to customers investment in c Si products from the acquisitions of HCT and Baccini and increased sales across all other products in the segment. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of an Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line. The operating loss of $183 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating loss reflected increased RDE spending to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of acquisition related costs, and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues. New orders of $245 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $37 million in fiscal 2006, due primarily to increased orders of c Si solar, glass and flexible electronics products. Net sales of $165 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $20 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher glass, flexible electronics and c Si solar net sales. Operating loss of $89 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $8 million in fiscal 2006, reflecting increased RDE spending to develop products and services that enable lower cost production of solar energy and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007, Applied introduced the Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line, the first integrated production line designed for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using 5.7 square meter glass panels. Orders and net sales in fiscal 2006 reflected the results of Applied Films solar, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass products that Applied acquired in the third quarter. Fiscal 2006 results included a $9 million IPRD expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films. Business Combinations and Equity Method Investment On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing c Si photovoltaic cells. On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. 37 Table of Contents On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Switzerland based HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The acquired business is the worlds leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in manufacturing c Si substrates for the solar industry. On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for $137 million in cash. The acquired business is a leading provider of factory management and control software to the semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Its products complement Applieds existing software applications and enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing solution for optimizing fab operations. On August 14, 2006, Applieds wholly owned subsidiary, Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from UMS Solutions PTE Ltd. for $10 million. The acquisition enhanced the Companys capabilities in Southeast Asia to provide advanced, high quality parts cleaning services to support its customers semiconductor manufacturing requirements. On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo Co., Ltd. (Sokudo), a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced track solutions for customers critical semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Track systems are a key part of semiconductor manufacturing and are used before and after photolithography to deposit, bake and develop the photoresist layer that defines circuit patterns. Screen owns 52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns 48 percent of Sokudo. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing track business and related intellectual property, including employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo. Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology and related intellectual property and has provided key development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo under an outsourcing agreement. On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of Applied Films, a leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment used in manufacturing LCDs, solar cells, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films for a total purchase price of approximately $484 million, or $328 million net of Applied Films existing cash and marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied assumed Applied Films outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards that, at the acquisition date, had a total fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was allocated to the purchase price and the remainder to unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and subject to vesting, Applied Films stock options became exercisable for shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films restricted stock unit awards became payable in shares of Applied common stock totaling, in the aggregate, three million shares of Applied common stock. On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc. for $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing. This business provides customers with precision parts cleaning and materials testing solutions. For further details, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3). FSP 142 3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of FSP 142 3 on its financial position and results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption permitted. Applied is 38 Table of Contents evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 161 on its financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). The standard changes the accounting for business combinations, including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141(R) will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 141(R) on its financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). The standard changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity, and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings. Additionally, SFAS 160 revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parents controlling ownership interest. SFAS 160 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 160 on its financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable. SFAS 159 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Management does not believe the effect of implementing SFAS 159 will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 (FSP 157 1) and FSP 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157 2). FSP 157 1 amends SFAS 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of Applieds first quarter of fiscal 2010. The measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities are effective for Applied beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP 157 3). FSP 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active, and provides guidance on the key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. Applied will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 157. Management does not believe the effect of implementing SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased to $3.5 billion at October 26, 2008 from $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, due primarily to share repurchases and cash dividend distributions, offset by cash generated from operating activities. Applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years. 39 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 26, October 28, 2008 2007 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,412 $ 1,203 Short term investments 689 1,167 Long term investments 1,367 1,362 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,468 $ 3,732 Applied generated cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008, $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007, and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, equity based compensation, asset impairments and restructuring and IPRD expenses, and changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable and inventories. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $167 million in fiscal 2008, $431 million in fiscal 2007, and $237 million in fiscal 2006. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. In fiscal 2008, Applied factored accounts receivables totaling $125 million. Days sales outstanding were 79 days at the end of fiscal 2008 and 2007, and 80 days at the end of fiscal 2006. Inventories increased by $674 million in fiscal 2008, mainly due to a net inventory increase within the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Applied used $76 million and $977 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, and generated $1.9 billion of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2006. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $405 million in fiscal 2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $150 million in fiscal 2007. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $2.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Proceeds from the sale of investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to fund Applieds accelerated stock buyback initiated during that year. Capital expenditures were $288 million in fiscal 2008, $265 million in fiscal 2007, and $179 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included investment in the implementation of a global business software system. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included investment in the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system, and in Applieds new global development capability center in Xian, China. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and three buildings in Santa Clara, California that Applied had previously leased. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2008, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. During the year Applied also purchased from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. consisting of its Brooks Software division for $137 million in cash. During fiscal 2006, Applied paid cash for acquisitions and the investment in a joint venture totaling $486 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied acquired the outstanding stock of Applied Films for $310 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired, and assumed equity awards with a fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million was included in the purchase price; formed a joint venture, Sokudo, with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Ltd., for which Applied paid $147 million in cash and contributed other assets; acquired certain assets of UMS Solutions for $10 million; and acquired ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc. for approximately $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Applied used cash of $1.4 billion for financing activities in fiscal 2008, $892 million in fiscal 2007, and $4.1 billion in fiscal 2006. Financing activities included issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment 40 Table of Contents of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007, and $4.2 billion in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, Applieds Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2008 was paid on December 4, 2008, to stockholders of record as of November 13, 2008. During fiscal 2007, Applieds Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. During fiscal 2006, Applieds Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 per share each. Dividends paid during fiscal 2008, 2007 and fiscal 2006 were $325 million, $306 million and $251 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of Applieds stockholders. Financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt. Applied did not have any borrowings in fiscal years 2008, 2007 or 2006. As of October 26, 2008, Applied had credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a 5 year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for borrowings at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 26, 2008. No amounts were outstanding under this agreement at October 26, 2008. Cash used for debt repayments totaled $2 million for fiscal 2008, $202 million for fiscal 2007, and $8 million for fiscal 2006. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to Applieds equity compensation programs totaled $401 million for fiscal 2008, $948 million for fiscal 2007, and $361 million for fiscal 2006. On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with Goldman Sachs under which Applied agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of Applieds outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased 145 million shares of its common stock on September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following four months. At the end of the four month period, Applied was entitled or subject to a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of Applied common stock during the purchase period. On January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of $132 million by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs, resulting in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was funded with Applieds existing cash and investments. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock. In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2008, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was $167 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied expects that changes in its business will affect its working capital components, primarily related to its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which includes products for manufacturing solar PVs. Applied believes that the solar industry is moving to increasingly greater factory output of solar modules, including projects with an output capable of generating electricity on a gigawatt scale. Applied has entered into contracts with multiple customers for its SunFabtm Thin Film Line, for projects of varying scale. Fulfillment of these contracts requires Applied to invest in inventory particularly work in process, and Applied may obtain customer deposits that reduce the associated effect on other working capital components. Applieds investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade municipal bonds, money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds, equity securities, and mortgage backed and asset backed securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. In fiscal 2008, as part of its regular investment review process, Applied recorded an insignificant impairment charge 41 Table of Contents associated with its investment portfolio. At October 26, 2008, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of $48 million due to a decrease in the fair market value of certain fixed rate debt and equity securities as a result of the recent turmoil in the global financial markets. Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair market value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near term prospects of the investee; and Applieds ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. Generally, the contractual terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments. While Applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, Applied believes that its investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio. The following types of financial instruments may present additional risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns: structured investment vehicles, auction rate securities, sub prime and Alt A mortgage backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. At October 26, 2008, Applieds holdings in these categories of investments totaled $30 million, or 1% of total cash, cash equivalents and investments, which Applied does not consider to be material. In the event that these categories of investments become illiquid, Applied does not believe that this will materially affect the Companys liquidity or results of operations. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. In November 2008, Applied announced that it had temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to maintain financial flexibility in light of the deteriorating global economic and market conditions. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended October 26, 2008, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2008, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $167 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required Applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $68 million for fiscal 2008, $62 million for fiscal 2007, and $70 million for fiscal 2006. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 26, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 203 $ 1 $ 2 $ $ 200 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 129 14 29 29 57 Operating lease obligations 118 58 44 13 3 Purchase obligations* 1,756 1,683 72 1 Other long term liabilities 185 7 98 20 60 $ 2,391 $ 1,763 $ 245 $ 63 $ 320 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods. 42 Table of Contents In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the Company has certain tax obligations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). The Company historically has classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of October 26, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $63 million and gross interest and penalties of $8 million. Of the $8 million in interest and penalties, $5 million is classified as long term payable and $3 million is classified as current payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Equity Based Compensation Employee Stock Option Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plans Effective on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which requires recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation. The fair value of stock options and ESPP shares is estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award, and Applied has elected to use the straight line method. The fair value of restricted stock units is calculated based upon the fair market value of Applieds common stock at the date of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 44 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk At October 26, 2008, Applieds investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.2 billion. Applieds primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 26, 2008 and October 28, 2007, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $31 million and $31 million, respectively. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired. All of Applieds debt bears interest at fixed rates. Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on Applieds results of operations for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions. Applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Applieds risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at October 26, 2008 were not material.
