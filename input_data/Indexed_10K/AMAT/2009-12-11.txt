This MDA should be read in conjunction with Applieds Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business, measurements and opportunities. Results of Operations: a discussion of operating results. Segment Information: a discussion of segment operating results. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates. Overview Applied provides Nanomanufacturing Technologytm solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment, service and software products. Applieds customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic cells and modules (solar PVs), flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Applieds results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Each of Applieds businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and technological advances in fabrication processes. Credit constraints in the financial markets and the weak global economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical markets in which Applied operates. The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 4,097 $ 9,155 $ 9,677 Net sales $ 5,014 $ 8,129 $ 9,735 Gross margin $ 1,431 $ 3,443 $ 4,492 Gross margin percent 28.5 % 42.4 % 46.1 % Net income (loss) $ (305 ) $ 961 $ 1,710 Earnings (loss) per share $ (0.23 ) $ 0.70 $ 1.20 Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending. In the second half of fiscal 2009, demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased, but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels. Fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. While Applied achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, a meaningful improvement in the equipment sector for fiscal 2010 will depend on a recovery 29 Table of Contents in customers end markets sufficient to support factories running at higher utilization and to encourage customers investments in new capacity, as well as advanced technologies. Applied currently expects a recovery in fiscal 2010, particularly in the market for semiconductor capital equipment, and anticipates that total net sales will increase more than 30 percent in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory, foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the recognition of orders for Applieds SunFabtm Thin Film Line for manufacturing solar panels. Net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers, partially offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon (c Si) solar manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in part by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industrys recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments. Net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected strong demand from dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory chip manufacturers, partially offset by a significant decline in LCD equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial investment in 2006. Improved net income in fiscal 2007 reflected higher sales and lower operating expenses, offset in part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial results included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products, and an in process research and development (IPRD) expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. (Brooks Software). Results of Operations The following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information: Fiscal Quarter Fiscal First Second Third Fourth Year (In millions, except per share amounts) 2009: New orders $ 903 $ 649 $ 1,072 $ 1,473 $ 4,097 Net sales $ 1,333 $ 1,020 $ 1,134 $ 1,526 $ 5,014 Gross margin $ 392 $ 156 $ 325 $ 559 $ 1,431 Net income (loss) $ (133 ) $ (255 ) $ (55 ) $ 138 $ (305 ) Earnings (loss) per diluted share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.23 ) 2008: New orders $ 2,500 $ 2,414 $ 2,030 $ 2,212 $ 9,155 Net sales $ 2,087 $ 2,150 $ 1,848 $ 2,044 $ 8,129 Gross margin $ 935 $ 967 $ 742 $ 799 $ 3,443 Net income $ 262 $ 303 $ 165 $ 231 $ 961 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.22 $ 0.12 $ 0.17 $ 0.70 2007: New orders $ 2,538 $ 2,648 $ 2,284 $ 2,206 $ 9,677 Net sales $ 2,277 $ 2,530 $ 2,561 $ 2,367 $ 9,735 Gross margin $ 1,063 $ 1,137 $ 1,216 $ 1,077 $ 4,492 Net income $ 403 $ 411 $ 474 $ 422 $ 1,710 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.34 $ 0.30 $ 1.20 30 Table of Contents Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. As a result of these conditions and the global economic environment, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip, LCD and solar PV supply and demand and other factors, including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. In response to the challenging economic environment in fiscal 2009, Applied implemented certain temporary cost reduction programs such as company wide shutdowns. New Orders New orders by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) China $ 749 $ 986 $ 783 North America(1) 711 1,680 1,518 Europe 675 1,134 1,035 Taiwan 625 2,110 2,703 Korea 559 1,477 1,639 Japan 531 1,224 1,520 Southeast Asia 247 544 479 $ 4,097 $ 9,155 $ 9,677 (1) Primarily the United States. New orders decreased 55 percent to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was across all segments, and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses, reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009. Customer demand for semiconductor and LCD equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009. New orders decreased 5 percent to $9.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic, memory, and foundry chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar equipment, including the initial recognition of orders for the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line. Demand for LCD equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as Display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters. New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor equipment, and service products. Demand for semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers absorbed added capacity, while demand from LCD customers recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Applieds backlog as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows: $2.7 billion at October 25, 2009, $4.8 billion at October 26, 2008, and $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007. Backlog decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to customer cancellations and financial debookings which totaled $1.2 billion, reflecting the decline in demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods. 31 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Taiwan $ 1,026 $ 1,837 $ 2,679 North America(1) 966 1,520 1,554 Europe 753 949 956 Japan 718 1,218 1,493 Korea 664 1,309 1,847 China 635 780 717 Southeast Asia 252 516 489 $ 5,014 $ 8,129 $ 9,735 (1) Primarily the United States. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers, partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment. Net sales decreased 16 percent to $8.1 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand from solar and LCD customers. During fiscal 2007, net sales increased by 6 percent, to $9.7 billion from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006, led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout the year. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.5 percent in fiscal 2009 from 42.4 percent in fiscal 2008, compared to 46.1 percent in fiscal 2007. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due to lower net sales, lower margin product mix, and reduced factory absorption, offset in part by cost control initiatives. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net sales and lower margin product mix. Gross margin during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $28 million, $32 million and $27 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Research, Development and Engineering Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RDE to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in RDE in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. RDE expenses were $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009, $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008 and $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007. RDE expense during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $50 million, $59 million and $56 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k/metal gate technologies, as well as double patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also focused on developing 32 Table of Contents technology for manufacturing next generation displays. RDE also included activities to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation. In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. Applied pioneered a self aligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for the implementation of through silicon vias. Efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the cost per watt of solar electricity. In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for customers new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k/metal gate technologies, and patterning processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also continued to invest in solar research and development. There were no IPRD charges recorded in either fiscal 2009 or 2008. During fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPRD expense of $5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks Automation Inc. Applieds methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPRD was determined through established valuation techniques. The IPRD was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were $735 million (15 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009, $965 million (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008, and $952 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007. The decrease in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to cost control initiatives. The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs from business acquisitions and equity compensation expenses, offset in part by cost control initiatives. Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $69 million, $88 million and $77 million, respectively, of equity based compensation expense. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,800 positions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied expanded the scope of the restructuring program by approximately 200 positions. During fiscal 2009, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $143 million associated with this program. The restructuring charges consisted of employee related costs to reduce the Companys workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs. During fiscal 2009, Applied also determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and, as a result, recorded a $15 million impairment charge. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its Silicon and Applied Global Services segments and related support organizations. As part of this plan, Applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $29 million relating to this plan, consisting primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce. The affected employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia, and represented multiple functions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied announced a plan (the Implant Plan) to cease development of beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England. Under the Implant Plan, Applied closed its research, development and manufacturing operations in Horsham in October 2007. Restructuring charges under the Implant Plan for fiscal 2008 totaled $11 million and were associated with facilities. Restructuring and asset impairment charges under the Implant Plan in fiscal 2007 aggregated $30 million and consisted of $21 million in restructuring charges primarily associated with employee related costs and $9 million in asset impairments. The majority of the affected employees were based in Horsham, England, and represented multiple functions. Costs associated with the Implant Plan in fiscal 2007 also 33 Table of Contents included inventory related charges, reported as cost of products sold, of $56 million and other operating expenses of $10 million. The Implant group operated in the Silicon segment, and the results of its operations were not material to Applieds financial position or results of operations. For further details, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $27 million for fiscal 2009, $89 million for fiscal 2008, and $98 million for fiscal 2007. The decrease in net interest and other income in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. The decrease in net interest and other income in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in investments and a decrease in interest rates, offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in September 2007. Income Taxes Applieds effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was a benefit of 37.2 percent as compared to a provision of 31.8 percent for fiscal 2008, and a provision of 29.9 percent for fiscal 2007. The change in the fiscal 2009 tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was principally attributable to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009. Applieds effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected a benefit of $36 million principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of prior years income tax filings, partially offset by a $13 million charge from the expensing of equity based compensation. Applieds future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income, and non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions. Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly. Segment Information Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include those for equity based compensation and certain components of variable compensation, corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and RDE), and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment. Silicon Segment The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection. Development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges, including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning, and on improving chip manufacturing productivity to reduce costs. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 1,677 $ 4,092 $ 6,651 Net sales $ 1,960 $ 4,005 $ 6,512 Operating income $ 152 $ 1,242 $ 2,379 Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. Silicon new orders decreased 59 percent to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders reflected significantly lower demand, primarily from memory and logic customers. Net sales decreased 51 percent to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009 34 Table of Contents compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased capital investments, primarily by memory customers. Operating income decreased 88 percent to $152 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower sales resulting in lower factory absorption, partially offset by lower operating expenses from cost control initiatives. Operating income for fiscal 2009 also reflected an increase in bad debt expense. After an operating loss in the first half of fiscal 2009, the Silicon segment returned to operating profitability during the second half of the year, which was primarily driven by sales to foundry customers. During the year, the Company introduced a new platform specifically designed for under bump metallization (UBM) and other back end processes, the Applied Charger UBM PVD system. Fiscal 2008 Silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to $4.1 billion compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic, memory and foundry customers. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers. Operating income decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry, partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost controls and improvement in manufacturing activities. In fiscal 2008, the Company launched two key products for photomask applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask Inspection system, which detects critical defects on a photomask, and the Applied Tetra Reticle Clean system, which cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry. The Company also introduced the Applied Producer eHARP system for depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures. Silicon orders in fiscal 2007 reflected the semiconductor industrys strength during this period, driven by demand for cell phones, computers, digital TVs, game consoles, MP3 players and other electronic products. The majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers invested in leading edge flash and DRAM memory devices, while orders from foundries remained at low levels. Net sales reflected increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in multiple areas, including etch, inspection, and RTP products. Operating income reflected higher revenue levels and continued focus on cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges of $66 million related to ceasing development of beamline implant products. In fiscal 2007, the Company launched the Applied Producer GT for chemical vapor deposition processing for 45 nm and beyond applications. Applied also announced its portfolio of high k/metal gate solutions, including the Applied Advanced Gate Stack and Applied Centura Carina Etch systems. Other new etch systems introduced were the Applied Mariana Trench, for etching high aspect ratio structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch with a new 5 chamber platform, and the Applied Centura Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch. The Company also added to its line of lithography enabling systems with the new Applied Producer ACE SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with the Applied Producer Celera CVD. Applied Global Services Segment The Applied Global Services segment encompasses technically differentiated products, including spares, services, certain earlier generation equipment products, and remanufactured equipment, to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating costs, and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers factories. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 1,179 $ 2,249 $ 2,508 Net sales $ 1,397 $ 2,329 $ 2,353 Operating income $ 113 $ 575 $ 630 Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions, as well as a significant reduction in the installed base of 200mm systems. New orders decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily to decreased demand for spares and refurbished equipment arising from semiconductor manufacturers 35 Table of Contents low wafer production volumes. Net sales decreased 40 percent to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting lower sales of spares and refurbished equipment. Operating income decreased 80 percent to $113 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of lower sales volumes, which led to lower infrastructure cost absorption, partially offset by lower operating expenses from cost control initiatives. Operating income for fiscal 2009 also included an increase in bad debt expense. In the second half of fiscal 2009, the Applied Global Services segment returned to operating profitability as sales of spares improved. Fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of semiconductor and display customers factory utilization. New orders decreased 10 percent to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower orders for spares, fab wide services, and refurbished equipment, partially offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements. Net sales decreased 1 percent to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The net sales decrease reflected lower sales of fab wide services and spares, offset by increased sales in services and system enhancements. Operating income decreased 9 percent to $575 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in fiscal 2008. New orders in fiscal 2007 reflected increased demand for spare parts and services, as well as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected increases in factory automation sales offset by declines in spares sales. Fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income compared to fiscal 2006 reflected changes in product mix and increased operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks Software acquisition. Display Segment The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other video enabled devices. The business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with larger scale substrates, entry into new markets, and development of products to enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 287 $ 1,486 $ 273 Net sales $ 502 $ 976 $ 705 Operating income $ 65 $ 310 $ 159 Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for LCD equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. New orders decreased significantly to $287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, which reflected the slowdown in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display manufacturers added capacity. Net sales decreased 49 percent to $502 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders. Operating income decreased to $65 million in fiscal 2009 from $310 million in fiscal 2008. Operating income decreased due to significantly lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to cost control initiatives. In fiscal 2008, new orders increased significantly to $1.5 billion compared to $273 million in fiscal 2007. Increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by Display customers in response to strong end product demand. This demand for LCD equipment reached an inflection point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, reflecting the volatility of the display industry. Net sales increased 38 percent to $976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to customers investment in Gen 8 products. Operating income increased to $310 million in fiscal 2008 from $159 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income increased due to higher revenue levels, product mix and lower operating costs. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced its Gen 10 systems that can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These systems include the AKT 90K PECVD and AKT 90K EBT products. New orders for fiscal 2007 reflected delays in capacity expansion plans by LCD panel makers in light of excess inventories and end product sales price declines. Display customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter 36 Table of Contents of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable market conditions. Net sales reflected lower investment by LCD manufacturers as they absorbed capacity. Operating income reflected lower revenues and factory absorption, product mix and higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition of Applied Films in July 2006. In 2007, Applied launched the AKT PiVottm 55KV system, which employs high productivity, cost efficient PVD technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide films on the substrate. Energy and Environmental Solutions Segment The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products for fabricating solar PV cells and modules, high throughput roll to roll coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and systems used in the manufacture of energy efficient glass. This segment also includes products for manufacturing c Si solar PVs that were obtained through the acquisitions of HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT) in fiscal 2007 and Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini) in fiscal 2008. This business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) New orders $ 955 $ 1,329 $ 245 Net sales $ 1,155 $ 819 $ 165 Operating loss $ 242 $ 183 $ 89 New orders of $955 million in fiscal 2009 decreased from $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was primarily due to decreased demand from c Si customers and reflected the challenging global economic environment, solar manufacturers difficulties in obtaining cost effective capital, and a decrease in end demand. Net sales of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from $819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for the Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line. The operating loss of $242 million in fiscal 2009 increased from $183 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in RDE expenses and unfavorable gross margins associated with initial SunFab line start ups, offset in part by cost control initiatives. In 2009, the Company introduced its Baccini Esatto Technology, a high precision, multi step printing capability designed to increase the efficiency of c Si solar cells, and its Applied HCT MaxEdge wire saw, featuring the industrys first dual wire management system for slicing ultra thin silicon wafers. New orders of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was primarily due to the recognition of orders for the SunFab line beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as well as growth in orders for c Si products. Net sales of $819 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $165 million in fiscal 2007 due to customers investment in c Si products from the acquisitions of HCT and Baccini, in addition to increased sales across all other products in the segment. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of a SunFab line. The operating loss of $183 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating loss reflected increased RDE spending to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of acquisition related costs, and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues. New orders in fiscal 2007 reflected increased demand for c Si solar, glass and flexible electronics products. Net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected higher net sales in glass, flexible electronics and c Si solar products. Operating loss for fiscal 2007 reflected increased RDE spending to develop products and services that enable lower cost production of solar energy and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007, Applied introduced the Applied SunFabtm Thin Film Line, the first integrated production line designed for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using 5.7 square meter glass panels. 37 Table of Contents Business Combinations On November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, Inc. (Semitool), a public company based in the state of Montana, for $11 per share in an all cash tender offer. Semitool is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by semiconductor packaging and manufacturing companies globally. Under the terms of the agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately $364 million based on the fully diluted capitalization of Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted through a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the occurrence or absence of certain events, including the tender of at least 66.67% of Semitools outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. In connection with this tender offer, Applied has been named as a defendant in three purported class action lawsuits filed in Montana state court. For further details, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing c Si photovoltaic cells. On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Switzerland based HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The acquired business is the worlds leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in manufacturing c Si substrates for the solar industry. On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for $137 million in cash. The acquired business is a leading provider of factory management and control software to the semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Its products complement Applieds existing software applications and enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing solution for optimizing fab operations. For further details, see Notes 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. This authoritative guidance impacts the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, this guidance modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. Applied will adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This authoritative guidance amends the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products. Applied will adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable interest entities, which becomes effective the first annual reporting period after November 15, 2009 and will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2011. This authoritative guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies, which amends the provisions related to the initial 38 Table of Contents recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under previously issued guidance. The authoritative guidance requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010. Applied expects that this authoritative guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies. In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. Applied will comply with this authoritative guidance in fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance on business combinations, including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited. Applied expects that this authoritative guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions it consummates after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on noncontrolling interests, which changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity, and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings. Additionally, this authoritative guidance revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parents controlling ownership interest. This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities, which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable. This authoritative guidance became effective for Applied beginning with its 2009 fiscal year. Applied has not elected the fair value measurement option for its financial assets or liabilities that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification, which amends previously issued guidance on fair value measurements to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. The FASB also issued authoritative guidance on the effective date of fair value measurements, which delays the effective date for Applied for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of Applieds first quarter of fiscal 2010. The measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities became effective for Applied beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the application of fair value measurements in a market that is not active, and provides guidance on the key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. Applied adopted the effective portions of fair value measurements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 3 for information and related disclosures regarding Applieds fair value measurements. 39 Table of Contents Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased to $3.3 billion at October 25, 2009 from $3.5 billion at October 26, 2008, due primarily to a decrease in cash generated from operating activities. Applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years. Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 25, October 26, 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,577 $ 1,412 Short term investments 638 689 Long term investments 1,052 1,367 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,267 $ 3,468 Applied generated cash from operating activities of $333 million in fiscal 2009, $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008, and $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007. The primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 were collections of accounts receivable and a reduction in inventories, which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in income taxes payable. The net loss incurred was offset by the effect of non cash charges, including depreciation, amortization, restructuring and asset impairments, equity based compensation, impairment of investments, and provision for bad debts. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $299 million in fiscal 2009, $167 million in fiscal 2008, and $431 million in fiscal 2007. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, Applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes totaling $43 million and $138 million, respectively. Days sales outstanding were 75 days at the end of fiscal 2009 and 79 days at the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Applied generated $113 million of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2009 and used $76 million and $977 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $361 million in fiscal 2009 and $405 million in fiscal 2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $150 million in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures were $248 million in fiscal 2009, $288 million in fiscal 2008, and $265 million in fiscal 2007. These expenditures were primarily for the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system and the construction of a solar RD/demonstration center in Xian, China. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 also included investment to construct a facility in Singapore. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2008, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. Also in fiscal 2008, Applied also purchased certain assets from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. consisting of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of HCT for $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. consisting of its Brooks Software division for $137 million in cash. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Applied used cash of $281 million for financing activities in fiscal 2009, $1.4 billion in fiscal 2008, and $892 million in fiscal 2007. Financing activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and to a lesser extent issuances and repurchases of common stock. Since November 2008, Applied has temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to maintain financial flexibility in light of uncertain global economic and market conditions. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $23 million in fiscal 2009, $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007. In each of fiscal 2009 and 2008, Applieds Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2009 was paid on December 3, 2009 to stockholders of record as of November 12, 2009. During fiscal 2007, Applieds Board 40 Table of Contents of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. Dividends paid during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $320 million, $325 million and $306 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of Applieds stockholders. Financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt. Applied did not have any borrowings in fiscal years 2009, 2008 or 2007. Cash used for debt repayments totaled $1 million for fiscal 2009, $2 million for fiscal 2008, and $202 million for fiscal 2007. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to Applieds equity compensation programs totaled $62 million for fiscal 2009, $401 million for fiscal 2008, and $948 million for fiscal 2007. Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a 5 year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 25, 2009. In May 2009, Applied amended certain terms of this credit agreement, including (i) replacing the funded debt to adjusted earnings ratio financial covenant with a minimum liquidity covenant and a funded debt to total capital ratio covenant and (ii) increasing the facility fee and applicable interest rate margins on advances. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $165 million are with Japanese banks. Applieds ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of the above credit facilities at October 25, 2009. In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2009, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was $83 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied expects that changes in its business will affect its working capital components, primarily related to its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, which includes products for manufacturing solar PVs. Applied has entered into contracts with multiple customers for its SunFab Thin Film Line for projects of varying scale. Fulfillment of these contracts requires Applied to invest in inventory, particularly work in process, which investment may be offset by customer deposits. Changes in these contracts may result in inventory charges if Applied determines the inventory to be in excess of anticipated demand. Applieds investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and, to a small extent, mortgage backed and asset backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. In fiscal 2009, as part of its regular investment review process, Applied recorded impairment charges of $84 million associated with its equity method investment in Sokudo Co., Ltd., other strategic investments and marketable securities. At October 25, 2009, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of $1 million due to a decrease in the fair value of certain fixed income securities. Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value. Generally, the contractual terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments. While Applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, Applied believes that its 41 Table of Contents investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio. The following types of financial instruments may present additional risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns: structured investment vehicles, auction rate securities, sub prime and Alt A mortgage backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. At October 25, 2009, Applieds holdings in these categories of investments totaled $6 million, or less than 1% of total cash, cash equivalents and investments, which Applied does not consider to be material. In the event that these categories of investments become illiquid, Applied does not believe that this will materially affect its liquidity or results of operations. During fiscal 2009, Applied recorded a bad debt provision of $63 million as a result of certain customers deteriorating financial condition. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at October 25, 2009 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions. On November 11, 2009, Applied announced that it will implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. As part of this program, Applied plans to reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to 12 percent, over a period of 18 months, consistent with local legal requirements and in consultation with employee works councils and other representatives, as applicable. The Company anticipates cash outlays of between $100 million and $125 million for this plan. On November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for $11 per share in an all cash tender offer. Under the terms of the agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately $364 million based on the fully diluted capitalization of Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted through a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the occurrence or absence of certain events, including the tender of at least 66.67% of Semitools outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended October 25, 2009, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2009, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was $83 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $64 million for fiscal 2009, $68 million for fiscal 2008, and $62 million for fiscal 2007. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 25, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 202 $ 1 $ 1 $ $ 200 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 115 14 29 29 43 Operating lease obligations 143 43 49 19 32 Purchase obligations* 1,083 1,069 11 3 Other long term liabilities 271 16 31 32 192 $ 1,814 $ 1,143 $ 121 $ 83 $ 467 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods. In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the Company has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of October 25, 2009, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $325 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $8 million as of October 26, 2008 and $5 million as of October 25, 2009. All $5 million in interest and penalties is classified as long term payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. As discussed above, on November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for $11 per share in an all cash tender offer. Under the terms of the agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately $364 million based on the fully diluted capitalization of Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted through a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the occurrence or absence of certain events, including the tender of at least 66.67% of Semitools outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and 43 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value. The fair value of a 44 Table of Contents reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in new emerging markets. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that Applieds future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk At October 25, 2009, Applieds investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.6 billion. Applieds primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 25, 2009, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $21 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the investment is determined to be other than temporarily impaired. All of Applieds debt bears interest at fixed rates. Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions. Applieds outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying 45 Table of Contents transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to Applieds near term financial condition or results of operations. Applieds risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at October 25, 2009 were not material. For further details, see Note 3 and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
