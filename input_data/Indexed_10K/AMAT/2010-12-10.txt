Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to facilitate an understanding of Applieds business and results of operations. This MDA should be read in conjunction with Applieds Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business and measurements Results of Operations: a discussion of operating results. Segment Information: a discussion of segment operating results. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates. Overview Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applieds customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar PV cells and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Applieds results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Each of Applieds businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and technological advances in fabrication processes. After a challenging year in fiscal 2009 that was characterized by credit constraints in the financial markets, a weak global economy and a semiconductor industry downturn, global economic and industry conditions affecting Applieds businesses generally improved in fiscal 2010, except for conditions in the thin film solar PV market. The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: Change Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 10,249 $ 4,097 $ 9,155 $ 6,152 $ (5,058) Net sales $ 9,549 $ 5,014 $ 8,129 $ 4,535 $ (3,115) Gross margin $ 3,715 $ 1,431 $ 3,443 $ 2,284 $ (2,012) Gross margin percent 39 % 29 % 42 % 10 points (14) points Operating income (loss) $ 1,384 $ (394 ) $ 1,355 $ 1,778 $ (1,749) Operating margin percent 14 % (8 )% 17 % 22 points (25) points Net income (loss) $ 938 $ (305 ) $ 961 $ 1,243 $ (1,266) Earnings (loss) per share $ 0.70 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.70 $ 0.93 $ (0.93) 32 Table of Contents Financial results for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 reflected significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions. The increase in total orders from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor, display and crystalline silicon (c Si) solar PV products, partially offset by decreased demand for SunFabtm thin film solar lines. Net sales increased during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, due primarily to higher sales of semiconductor and display equipment. Also, in fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges totaling $84 million associated with a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,000 positions over a period of 18 months. In addition, Applied incurred charges totaling $486 million that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. This action was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar, including delays in utility scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy policies, and competitive pressure from c Si solar technologies. As part of the restructuring, Applied discontinued sales to new customers of its fully integrated SunFab lines but continued to offer individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing. Applied is supporting existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment and will continue RDE efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and high productivity deposition. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending. In the second half of fiscal 2009, demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased, but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels. Fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007 due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory, foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the initial recognition of orders for Applieds SunFab thin film line for manufacturing solar panels. Net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers, partially offset by increased sales of c Si solar manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in part by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information: Fiscal Quarter Fiscal First Second Third Fourth Year (In millions, except per share amounts) 2010: New orders $ 1,965 $ 2,533 $ 2,725 $ 3,026 $ 10,249 Net sales $ 1,849 $ 2,296 $ 2,518 $ 2,886 $ 9,549 Gross margin $ 711 $ 927 $ 860 $ 1,217 $ 3,715 Operating income $ 116 $ 386 $ 183 $ 699 $ 1,384 Net income $ 83 $ 264 $ 123 $ 468 $ 938 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.06 $ 0.20 $ 0.09 $ 0.35 $ 0.70 2009: New orders $ 903 $ 649 $ 1,072 $ 1,473 $ 4,097 Net sales $ 1,333 $ 1,020 $ 1,134 $ 1,526 $ 5,014 Gross margin $ 392 $ 156 $ 325 $ 559 $ 1,431 Operating income (loss) $ (196 ) $ (293 ) $ (77 ) $ 173 $ (394 ) Net income (loss) $ (133 ) $ (255 ) $ (55 ) $ 138 $ (305 ) Earnings (loss) per diluted share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.23 ) 2008: New orders $ 2,500 $ 2,414 $ 2,030 $ 2,212 $ 9,155 Net sales $ 2,087 $ 2,150 $ 1,848 $ 2,044 $ 8,129 Gross margin $ 935 $ 967 $ 742 $ 799 $ 3,443 Operating income $ 373 $ 438 $ 228 $ 316 $ 1,355 Net income $ 262 $ 303 $ 165 $ 231 $ 961 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.22 $ 0.12 $ 0.17 $ 0.70 Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. As a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the three fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip, LCD and solar PV supply and demand and other factors, including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. 34 Table of Contents New Orders New orders by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Change Change 2010 2010 over 2009 2009 2009 over 2008 2008 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Taiwan 2,760 27 342 625 15 (70 ) 2,110 23 Korea 2,155 21 188 749 18 (24 ) 986 11 China 1,703 17 205 559 14 (62 ) 1,477 17 Japan 741 7 40 531 13 (57 ) 1,224 13 Southeast Asia 675 7 173 247 6 (55 ) 544 6 Asia Pacific 8,034 79 196 2,711 66 (57 ) 6,341 70 North America(*) 1,348 13 90 711 17 (58 ) 1,680 18 Europe 867 8 28 675 17 (40 ) 1,134 12 Total 10,249 100 150 4,097 100 (55 ) 9,155 100 (*) Primarily the United States. New orders more than doubled to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was principally due to greater demand for semiconductor equipment and services, primarily from memory and foundry customers, as well as increased demand for c Si solar manufacturing products and display equipment. The increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and the LCD market from the steep downturn experienced in fiscal 2009. New orders decreased 55 percent to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was across all segments, and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses, reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009. Customer demand for semiconductor and LCD equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009. New orders decreased 5 percent to $9.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic, memory, and foundry chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and solar equipment, including the initial recognition of orders for the Applied SunFab thin film line. Demand for LCD equipment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as Display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over the preceding three quarters. Applieds backlog as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows: $3.2 billion at October 31, 2010, $2.7 billion at October 25, 2009, and $4.8 billion at October 26, 2008. Backlog increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in new orders for Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services reflecting increased demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. In addition, the majority of sales in the largest business segment were from orders received and shipped in the same quarter. 35 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: Change Change 2010 2010 over 2009 2009 2009 over 2008 2008 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Taiwan 2,750 29 168 1,026 21 (44 ) 1,837 22 Korea 1,768 19 166 664 13 (49 ) 1,309 16 China 1,557 16 145 635 13 (19 ) 780 10 Japan 768 8 7 718 14 (41 ) 1,218 15 Southeast Asia 578 6 129 252 5 (51 ) 516 6 Asia Pacific 7,421 78 125 3,295 66 (42 ) 5,660 69 North America(*) 1,147 12 19 966 19 (36 ) 1,520 19 Europe 981 10 30 753 15 (21 ) 949 12 Total 9,549 100 90 5,014 100 (38 ) 8,129 100 (*) Primarily the United States. Net sales of $9.5 billion for fiscal 2010 increased 90 percent from fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales of semiconductor equipment. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers, partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment. Net sales decreased 16 percent to $8.1 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand from solar and LCD customers. Gross Margin Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Gross margin $ 3,715 $ 1,431 $ 3,443 $ 2,284 $ (2,012) Gross margin (% of net sales) 39 % 29 % 42 % 10 points (13) points The increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was principally attributable to higher net sales, more favorable product mix, improved factory utilization, and continued cost control measures, offset in part by inventory related charges of $330 million associated with SunFab thin film solar equipment. These inventory related charges lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due to lower net sales, lower margin product mix, and reduced factory absorption, offset in part by cost control initiatives. Gross margin during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $32 million, $28 million and $32 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Research, Development and Engineering Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions) Research, development and engineering $ 1,144 $ 934 $ 1,104 $ 210 $ (170 ) Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RDE to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and 36 Table of Contents projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in RDE in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. RDE expenses were $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2010, $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009 and $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008. RDE expense during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $43 million, $50 million and $59 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2010, Applied developed new technology to enable next generation 22nm and below chip designs. These systems were designed to help customers continue their drive to pack more transistors in the same space using using high k/metal gate technologies and double patterning processes. Applied also developed technology for through silicon vias (TSVs), an emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip stacks to provide better device performance, lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices. In the solar PV area, Applied continued the development of its precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering the cost of producing solar generated electricity through advanced crystalline silicon technology. In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k/metal gate technologies, as well as double patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also focused on developing technology for manufacturing next generation displays. RDE also included activities to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation. In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. Applied pioneered a self aligned double patterning approach that can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for the implementation of through silicon vias. Efforts were also focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the cost per watt of solar electricity. Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions) Marketing, selling, general and administrative $ 942 $ 735 $ 965 $ 207 $ (230 ) The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 reflected the elimination of temporary salary reductions and shutdowns, and the resumption of variable compensation programs. The decrease in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to cost control initiatives. Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2010, 15 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009, and 12 percent of net sales in fiscal 2008. Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $51 million, $69 million and $88 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Restructuring and Asset Impairments Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions) Restructuring and asset impairments $ 246 $ 156 $ 40 $ 90 $ 116 During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied announced a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. The action, which was expected to impact between 400 to 500 positions globally, was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar, including delays in utility scale solar adoption, solar panel 37 Table of Contents manufacturers challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy polices, and competitive pressure from c Si solar technologies. During fiscal 2010, Applied recorded charges related to this plan totaling $403 million, which included inventory related charges of $247 million related to SunFab thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of $108 million, employee severance charges of $45 million, and other costs of $3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to 12 percent, over a period of 18 months. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $104 million associated with this program. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, as a result of changes in business requirements, Applied revised its global workforce reduction to approximately 1,000 positions and recorded a favorable adjustment of $20 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied announced a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,800 positions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied expanded the scope of the restructuring program by approximately 200 positions. During fiscal 2009, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $143 million associated with this program. The restructuring charges consisted of employee related costs to reduce the Companys workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs. In addition, Applied determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and, as a result, recorded a $15 million impairment charge. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments and related support organizations. As part of this plan, Applied reduced its global workforce through a combination of job elimination and attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring charges of $29 million relating to this plan, consisting primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce. The affected employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia, and represented multiple functions. For further details, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Interest Income Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions) Net interest income $ 16 $ 27 $ 89 $ (11 ) $ (62 ) The decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. The decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. The decrease in net interest income in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in investments and a decrease in interest rates, offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities that occurred in September 2007. Income Taxes Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 449 $ (180 ) $ 448 $ 629 $ (628) Effective income tax rate 32 % (37 )% 32 % 69 points (69) points The change in the fiscal 2010 tax rate from the fiscal 2009 rate was principally attributable to the income before taxes for fiscal 2010 as opposed to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the U.S. RD tax credit from the time it expired in December 2009. In the event the U.S. RD tax credit is enacted on a retroactive basis, there would be a favorable impact to Applieds effective income tax rate in the period enacted. The change in the fiscal 2009 tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was 38 Table of Contents principally attributable to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009. Applieds effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, and the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income. Segment Information Applied reports financial results in four segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include costs for share based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and RDE functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these charges or adjustments pertain to a specific reportable segment. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied changed its methodology for allocating certain expenses to its reportable segments, such as components of variable compensation and operating expenses associated with the global sales organization. Applied has reclassified segment operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation. The results for each reportable segment are discussed below. Silicon Systems Group Segment The Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. Development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges, including transistor performance and nanoscale patterning, and improving chip manufacturing productivity to reduce costs. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except percentages) New orders $ 5,759 $ 1,677 $ 4,092 $ 4,082 243 % $ (2,415 ) (59) % Net sales 5,304 1,960 4,005 3,344 171 % (2,045 ) (51) % Operating income 1,892 201 1,229 1,691 841 % (1,028 ) (84) % Operating margin 36 % 10 % 31 % 26 points (21) points Fiscal 2010 financial results reflected increased demand for manufacturing equipment over fiscal 2009 due to improved global economic and industry conditions. New orders increased by $4.1 billion to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The significant increase in new orders was primarily from memory and foundry customers and to a lesser extent logic customers, which reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry. The majority of fiscal 2010 new orders were for customers capacity expansions, while fiscal 2009 orders were primarily for customers new technology investments. Net sales increased by $3.3 billion to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased investment by memory and foundry customers. Four customers accounted for 51 percent of net sales in this segment in fiscal 2010. Approximately 61 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter. The book to bill ratio (new orders divided by net sales) increased to 1.1 for fiscal 2010, reflecting increased demand, compared to 0.9 for fiscal 2009. Operating income increased by $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income for fiscal 2010 was due to considerably higher revenue from semiconductor equipment sales and reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry during fiscal 2010. Results for fiscal 2010 included Semitool, which was acquired by Applied during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In 2010, Applied introduced its Applied Reflexion GT CMP system, for fabricating copper interconnects and its Applied Centura AdvantEdgetm Mesatm silicon etch system for fabricating nano scale circuit features with angstrom level precision. The Applied Producer Eternatm 39 Table of Contents FCVD system, which is targeted for 20nm and below chips, delivers a liquid like film that flows freely into virtually any structure to provide void free dielectric fill. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. Silicon Systems Group new orders decreased 59 percent to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders reflected significantly lower demand, primarily from memory and logic customers. Net sales decreased 51 percent to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased capital investments, primarily by memory customers. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.9 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased demand, compared to 1.0 for fiscal 2008. Operating income decreased 84 percent to $201 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower sales resulting in lower factory absorption, partially offset by lower operating expenses from cost control initiatives. Operating income for fiscal 2009 also reflected an increase in bad debt expense. After an operating loss in the first half of fiscal 2009, the Silicon Systems Group returned to operating profitability during the second half of the year, which was primarily driven by sales to foundry customers. During the year, the Company introduced a new platform specifically designed for under bump metallization (UBM) and other back end processes, the Applied Charger UBM PVD system. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected reduced demand for manufacturing equipment due to less favorable industry conditions. Fiscal 2008 Silicon Systems Group new orders decreased 38 percent to $4.1 billion compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic, memory and foundry customers. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers. Operating income decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry, partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost controls and improvement in manufacturing activities. In fiscal 2008, the Company launched two products for photomask applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask Inspection system, which detects critical defects on a photomask, and the Applied Tetra Reticle Clean system, which cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry. The Company also introduced the Applied Producer eHARP system for depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures.

Display Segment The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other video enabled devices. The business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with larger scale substrates, entry into new markets, and development of products to enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except percentages) New orders $ 799 $ 287 $ 1,486 $ 512 179 % $ (1,199 ) (81) % Net sales 899 502 976 397 79 % (474 ) (49) % Operating income 267 51 301 216 424 % (250 ) (83) % Operating margin 30 % 10 % 31 % 20 points (21) points Fiscal 2010 operating financial results reflected increased demand for LCD equipment over fiscal 2009 due to improved global economic and industry conditions. New orders increased by $512 million to $799 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the LCD market, as customers increased production levels in response to strong end demand for flat panel TVs and notebook computers. Net sales increased by $397 million to $899 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in net sales reflected strong market demand for LCD products. Five customers accounted for 71 percent of net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2010. The book to bill ratio increased to 0.9 for fiscal 2010, reflecting increased demand, compared to 0.6 for fiscal 2009. Operating income increased by $216 million to $267 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income was due to a significant increase in net sales and improved gross margin driven by an increase in volume. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for LCD equipment due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. New orders decreased significantly to $287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, which reflected the slowdown in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display manufacturers added capacity. Net sales decreased 49 percent to $502 million in fiscal 2009 compared 41 Table of Contents to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders. Operating income decreased to $51 million in fiscal 2009 from $301 million in fiscal 2008. Operating income decreased due to significantly lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to cost control initiatives. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.6 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased demand, compared to 1.5 for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected increased demand for LCD equipment over fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, new orders increased significantly to $1.5 billion compared to $273 million in fiscal 2007. Increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by Display customers in response to strong end product demand. This demand for LCD equipment reached an inflection point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, reflecting the volatility of the display industry. Net sales increased 38 percent to $976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to customers investment in Gen 8 products. Operating income increased to $301 million in fiscal 2008 from $159 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income increased due to higher revenue levels, product mix and lower operating costs. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced its Gen 10 systems that can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These systems include the AKT 90K PECVD and AKT 90K EBT products.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 over 2009 2009 over 2008 (In millions, except percentages) New orders $ 1,508 $ 955 $ 1,329 $ 553 58 % $ (374 ) (28) % Net sales 1,481 1,155 819 326 28 % 336 41 % Operating income (466 ) (234 ) (206 ) (232 ) (99) % (28 ) (14) % Operating margin (31 )% (20 )% (25 )% (11) points 5 points Fiscal 2010 financial results reflected increased demand for c Si products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab thin film solar manufacturing lines due to the challenging market conditions for utility scale solar. New orders increased 58 percent to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in orders reflected increased demand for c Si products, particularly wafering and metallization products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab lines. Net sales increased 28 percent to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Net sales for fiscal 2010 primarily reflected higher sales to c Si customers than in fiscal 2009. The relative share of the segments net sales attributable to SunFab customers decreased to 36 percent in fiscal 2010 from 44 percent in fiscal 2009. The book to bill ratio increased to 1.0 for fiscal 2010 compared to 0.8 for fiscal 2009. The operating loss in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment increased by $232 million to $466 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to restructuring, asset impairment and inventory related charges of $486 million recognized in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, and lower net sales to SunFab customers, partially offset by increased sales of c Si products and cost control initiatives. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 reflected customer final acceptance of two SunFab lines. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected reduced demand for c Si products over fiscal 2008 offset in part by higher demand for SunFab lines. New orders of $955 million in fiscal 2009 decreased from $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was primarily due to decreased demand from c Si customers and reflected the 42 Table of Contents challenging global economic environment, solar manufacturers difficulties in obtaining cost effective capital, and a decrease in end demand. Net sales of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from $819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for SunFab lines. The operating loss of $234 million in fiscal 2009 increased from $206 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in RDE expenses and unfavorable gross margins associated with initial SunFab line start ups, offset in part by cost control initiatives. In 2009, the Company introduced its Baccini Esatto Technology, a high precision, multi step printing capability designed to increase the efficiency of c Si solar cells. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.8 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased demand, compared to 1.6 for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected increased demand for c Si products over fiscal 2007 and the recognition of orders for the SunFab line beginning in fiscal 2008. New orders of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was primarily due to the recognition of orders for the SunFab line beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as well as growth in orders for c Si products. Net sales of $819 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $165 million in fiscal 2007 due to customers investment in c Si products from the acquisitions of HCT and Baccini, in addition to increased sales across all other products in the segment. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of a SunFab line. The operating loss of $206 million in fiscal 2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating loss reflected increased RDE spending to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of acquisition related costs, and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues. Subsequent Event On November 29, 2010, Applied entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Agreement) with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung). The Agreement resolved potential civil claims and removed the risk of civil litigation between the parties relating to the alleged acquisition, misappropriation and misuse of Samsung confidential semiconductor information in Korea that is the subject of criminal proceedings pending against employees of several companies, including current and former Applied Materials Korea employees, in the Seoul Eastern District Court of the Republic of Korea (the Korea proceedings). Neither Applied nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in the Korea proceedings. The settlement terms of the Agreement pertain to potential civil claims between the parties and are separate from and do not affect criminal proceedings against individual defendants, including but not limited to the individuals charged in the Korea proceedings. Under the Agreement, which is generally effective for a three year period starting November 1, 2010, Applied will provide volume based rebates on purchases of semiconductor products by Samsung and its affiliated companies. Applied also will provide volume based incentives related to Samsungs use of Applied systems (i) for production of semiconductor devices in applications for which Samsung has not previously used Applied systems, and (ii) for joint development activities. In addition, the Agreement includes volume based credits for certain upgrades, engineering services and spare parts. The financial impact of the above rebates and incentives on Applieds consolidated results of operations and financial position will depend on the volume of purchases by Samsung after the effective date of the Agreement. Business Combinations On December 21, 2009, Applied acquired Semitool, Inc., a public company based in the state of Montana, for a purchase price of $323 million in cash, net of cash acquired, pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent short form merger. The acquired business is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by semiconductor packaging and manufacturing companies globally. Applieds primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement its existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. The acquired business is included in results for the Silicon Systems Group segment. In November 2009, Applied acquired substantially all the assets, including the intellectual property, of Advent Solar, a developer of advanced technology for c Si solar photovoltaic cells and modules (PVs), for a purchase price of $14 million. This acquisition complemented Applieds portfolio of solar PV technologies and enhanced 43 Table of Contents Applieds opportunities in the c Si equipment market. The acquisition is included in results for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini S.p.A., a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing c Si photovoltaic cells. On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2010, the FASB issued updated authoritative guidance that amends the requirements for evaluating whether a decision maker or service provider has a variable interest entity and clarified that a quantitative approach should not be the sole consideration in assessing the criteria for variable interest entity determination. The guidance also clarifies that related parties should be considered in applying all of the decision maker and service provider criteria. This is in addition to the authoritative guidance the FASB issued in June 2009 that applies to determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Under this guidance, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, requires enhanced disclosures, and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities. This authoritative guidance is effective for Applied beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which requires additional disclosures and clarifications to existing disclosures. This authoritative guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements became effective for Applied in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Disclosures regarding activity within Level 3 fair value measurements become effective the first interim reporting period after December 15, 2010 and will be effective for Applied in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information and related disclosures regarding Applieds fair value measurements. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable interest entities, which requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. In December 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the financial reporting by entities involved with variable interest entities which amends previously issued guidance on variable interest entities. The amendments in this authoritative guidance replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. This authoritative guidance becomes 44 Table of Contents effective for Applied in fiscal 2011. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $3.9 billion at October 31, 2010 from $3.3 billion at October 25, 2009, due primarily to an increase in cash generated from operating activities. Applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years. Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 31, October 25, October 26, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,858 $ 1,577 $ 1,412 Short term investments 727 638 689 Long term investments 1,307 1,052 1,367 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,892 $ 3,267 $ 3,468 A summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,723 $ 333 $ 1,710 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (862 ) $ 113 $ (76 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (576 ) $ (281 ) $ (1,426 ) Applied generated cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010, $333 million in fiscal 2009, and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008. The primary sources of cash from operating activities for fiscal 2010 were net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and asset impairments, share based compensation, and changes in components of working capital. Changes in working capital included thin film solar inventory related charges of $330 million. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $230 million in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009, and $167 million in fiscal 2008. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. For fiscal 2010, Applied factored accounts receivable of $153 million and discounted promissory notes of $3 million. For fiscal 2009, Applied factored accounts receivable of $39 million and discounted promissory notes of $4 million. For fiscal 2008, Applied factored accounts receivable of $133 million and discounted promissory notes of $6 million. Days sales outstanding were 58 at the end of fiscal 2010, 75 days at the end of fiscal 2009, and 79 days at the end of fiscal 2008. The 2010 reduction in the days sales outstanding from the prior year was attributable to higher net sales and improved working capital management. Applieds working capital was $3.9 billion at October 31, 2010 and $3.7 billion at both October 25, 2009 and October 26, 2008. During fiscal 2010, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of approximately $130 million for the carryback of Applieds net operating loss from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2005. Applied used $862 million of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2010. Applied generated $113 million of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2009 and used $76 million in fiscal 2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $370 million in fiscal 2010. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $361 million in fiscal 2009 and $405 million in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures were $169 million in fiscal 2010, $248 million in fiscal 2009, and $288 million in fiscal 2008. These expenditures were primarily for the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system and the construction of a solar RD/demonstration center in Xian, China. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 also included investment to construct a facility in Singapore. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. In fiscal 2010, Applied acquired Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for $323 million, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2008, Applied acquired 45 Table of Contents all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. Also in fiscal 2008, Applied purchased certain assets from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. consisting of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Applied used cash for financing activities in the amount of $576 million for fiscal 2010, $281 million for fiscal 2009, and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Financing activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $350 million in fiscal 2010, $23 million in fiscal 2009, and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008. In March 2010, Applieds Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $2.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in March 2013. Proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were $129 million in fiscal 2010, $62 million in fiscal 2009, and $401 million in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, Applieds Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per share. The fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share declared in fiscal 2010 will be paid on December 15, 2010 to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010. During fiscal 2009, Applieds Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each quarter. During fiscal 2008, Applieds Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. Cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $349 million, $320 million and $325 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration and amount of any future cash dividend are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of Applieds stockholders. Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.1 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a 5 year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 31, 2010. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $98 million are with Japanese banks. Applieds ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of the above credit facilities at October 31, 2010. In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2010, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was $54 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements. Applieds investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. In fiscal 2010, as part of its regular investment review process, Applied recorded impairment charges of $13 million associated with equity investments in privately held companies. At October 31, 2010, Applied had a gross unrealized loss in its investment portfolio of $1 million due to a decrease in the fair value of certain fixed income securities. Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value. Generally, the contractual terms of the investments 46 Table of Contents do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments. While Applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, Applied believes that its investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio. During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, Applied recorded bad debt provisions, net of recoveries, of $10 million and $62 million, respectively, as a result of certain customers deteriorating financial condition. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at October 31, 2010 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2010, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was $54 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $52 million for fiscal 2010, $64 million for fiscal 2009, and $68 million for fiscal 2008. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 205 $ 1 $ 2 $ 1 $ 201 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 101 14 29 29 29 Operating lease obligations 143 42 45 26 30 Purchase obligations* 2,055 2,053 2 Other long term liabilities 239 21 44 45 129 $ 2,743 $ 2,131 $ 122 $ 101 $ 389 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods. In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the Company has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of October 31, 2010, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $328 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $6 million as of October 31, 2010 and $5 million as of October 25, 2009. All $6 million in interest and penalties is classified as long term payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, the Company is unable to make a 47 Table of Contents reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sellers price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. Each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. In addition, Applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition and results of operations. In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products. This new guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of managements best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable. Applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal 2010. The implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales as compared to net sales under previous guidance, as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales. 48 Table of Contents Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a 49 Table of Contents valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that Applieds future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Applieds investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.0 billion at October 31, 2010. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 31, 2010, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $25 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated condensed statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary. Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2010.
