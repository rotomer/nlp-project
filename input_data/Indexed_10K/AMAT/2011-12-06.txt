Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to facilitate an understanding of Applieds business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with Applieds Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this Form 10 K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business and measurements Results of Operations: a discussion of operating results. Segment Information: a discussion of segment operating results. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates. Overview Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applieds customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar PV cells and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect Applieds operations is set forth under Risk Factors in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Applieds results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Each of Applieds businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and technological advances in fabrication processes. The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: Change Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) New orders $ 10,142 $ 10,249 $ 4,097 $ (107 ) $ 6,152 Net sales $ 10,517 $ 9,549 $ 5,014 $ 968 $ 4,535 Gross margin $ 4,360 $ 3,715 $ 1,431 $ 645 $ 2,284 Gross margin percent 41 % 39 % 29 % 2 points 10 points Operating income (loss) $ 2,398 $ 1,384 $ (394 ) $ 1,014 $ 1,778 Operating margin percent 23 % 14 % (8 )% 9 points 22 points Net income (loss) $ 1,926 $ 938 $ (305 ) $ 988 $ 1,243 Earnings (loss) per diluted share $ 1.45 $ 0.70 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.75 $ 0.93 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 and 2009 contained 52 weeks each, while fiscal 2010 contained 53 weeks. Financial results for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 reflected a decrease in total new orders, while net sales increased to a record level and net income also increased. The decline in new orders reflected softening demand for semiconductor, LCD and solar equipment in the second half of the year. The semiconductor industry was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment whereas the LCD and solar equipment industries were negatively impacted by overcapacity. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $1.6 billion, down 33 percent from the prior quarter. For fiscal 2011, net sales increased year over year primarily due to increased industry investment in crystalline silicon (c Si) solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment. Operating income for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments to restructuring reserves of $60 million, offset in part by asset impairment charges of $30 million, and a net gain on sale of facilities of $27 million. In fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges totaling $486 million that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Financial results for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 reflected significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions. The increase in total orders from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor, display and c Si solar PV products, partially offset by decreased demand for SunFab thin film solar lines. Net sales increased during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, due primarily to higher sales of semiconductor and display equipment. In fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges totaling $486 million that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment, consisting of inventory related charges of $330 million related to SunFab thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of $108 million, employee severance charges of $45 million, and other costs of $3 million. This action was in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar, including delays in utility scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy policies, and competitive pressure from c Si solar technologies. As part of the restructuring, Applied discontinued sales to new customers of its fully integrated SunFab lines but continued to offer individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing. Applied is supporting existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment and is continuing RD&E efforts to improve thin film panel efficiency and high productivity deposition. Also in fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges totaling $84 million associated with a restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,000 positions over a period of 18 months. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to reduce their spending. In the second half of fiscal 2009, demand for semiconductor and display equipment increased, but was still down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels. Fiscal 2009 financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs. In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition enhances Applieds product portfolio with market leading ion implantation technology and is expected to enable Applied to become the semiconductor industry leader in transistor technologies. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information: Fiscal Quarter FiscalYear First Second Third Fourth (In millions, except per share amounts) 2011: New orders $ 2,971 $ 3,185 $ 2,390 $ 1,596 $ 10,142 Net sales $ 2,686 $ 2,862 $ 2,787 $ 2,182 $ 10,517 Gross margin $ 1,136 $ 1,189 $ 1,184 $ 852 $ 4,360 Operating income $ 674 $ 677 $ 687 $ 361 $ 2,398 Net income $ 506 $ 489 $ 476 $ 456 $ 1,926 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.38 $ 0.37 $ 0.36 $ 0.34 $ 1.45 2010: New orders $ 1,965 $ 2,533 $ 2,725 $ 3,026 $ 10,249 Net sales $ 1,849 $ 2,296 $ 2,518 $ 2,886 $ 9,549 Gross margin $ 711 $ 927 $ 860 $ 1,217 $ 3,715 Operating income $ 116 $ 386 $ 183 $ 699 $ 1,384 Net income $ 83 $ 264 $ 123 $ 468 $ 938 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.06 $ 0.20 $ 0.09 $ 0.35 $ 0.70 2009: New orders $ 903 $ 649 $ 1,072 $ 1,473 $ 4,097 Net sales $ 1,333 $ 1,020 $ 1,134 $ 1,526 $ 5,014 Gross margin $ 392 $ 156 $ 325 $ 559 $ 1,431 Operating income (loss) $ (196 ) $ (293 ) $ (77 ) $ 173 $ (394 ) Net income (loss) $ (133 ) $ (255 ) $ (55 ) $ 138 $ (305 ) Earnings (loss) per diluted share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.23 ) Demand for manufacturing equipment historically has been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip, LCD, and solar PV supply and demand and other factors, including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. As a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the three fiscal years. As of the end of fiscal 2011, the semiconductor, display and solar equipment industries were each in a capacity driven downturn. The nature and timing of a recovery in capital equipment investment are expected to depend largely on the macroeconomic environment. 41 Table of Contents New Orders New orders by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 Change2010 over 2009 2009 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Taiwan 2,235 22 (19 ) 2,760 27 342 625 15 China 2,066 20 (4 ) 2,155 21 188 749 18 Korea 1,286 13 (25 ) 1,703 17 205 559 14 Japan 1,001 10 35 741 7 40 531 13 Southeast Asia 463 5 (31 ) 675 7 173 247 6 Asia Pacific 7,051 70 (12 ) 8,034 79 196 2,711 66 North America(*) 2,069 20 54 1,348 13 90 711 17 Europe 1,022 10 18 867 8 28 675 17 Total 10,142 100 (1 ) 10,249 100 150 4,097 100 (*) Primarily the United States. New orders of $10.1 billion for fiscal 2011 were down 1 percent from fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and decreased demand for LCD equipment, partially offset by increased demand for touch panel tools from display customers and increased demand for c Si equipment from solar manufacturers. Customers in China and Taiwan together represented 42 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2011. From fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, new orders more than doubled to $10.2 billion. The increase was principally due to greater demand for semiconductor equipment and services, primarily from memory and foundry customers, as well as increased demand for c Si solar manufacturing products and display equipment. The increase in new orders reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and the LCD market from the steep downturn experienced in fiscal 2009. Customers in Taiwan and China together represented 48 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2010. New orders decreased 55 percent to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was across all segments, and particularly in the semiconductor and display businesses, reflecting the challenging economic and industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009. Customer demand for semiconductor and LCD equipment began to recover in the second half of fiscal 2009. Customers in China, North America, and Europe combined represented 52 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2009. New orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 Change2010 over 2009 2009 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Silicon Systems Group 5,489 54 (5 ) 5,759 56 243 1,677 41 Applied Global Services 2,333 23 7 2,183 21 85 1,179 29 Display 636 6 (20 ) 799 8 178 287 7 Energy and Environmental Solutions 1,684 17 12 1,508 15 58 955 23 Total 10,142 100 (1 ) 10,249 100 150 4,098 100 For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, new orders by segment as well as the relative share of total new orders for the Silicon Systems Group and Display decreased, while new orders by segment as well as the relative 42 Table of Contents share of new orders in Applied Global Services and Energy and Environmental Solutions increased. For fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, new orders increased in all segments, with the relative share of total new orders increasing significantly for the Silicon Systems Group while the relative share of new orders in Applied Global Services and Energy and Environmental Solutions decreased by 8 percentage points each. Applieds backlog was $2.4 billion at October 30, 2011 as compared to $3.2 billion at October 31, 2010. Backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2011 and totaled $504 million, consisting primarily of orders with revised shipment dates outside of Applieds order policy and included $124 million in customer cancellations. Backlog decreased in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreases in new orders for the Silicon Systems Group and Display, reflecting decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and a weaker LCD market, respectively. Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, approximately 45 percent of net sales in the Silicon Systems Group, Applieds largest business segment, were for orders received and shipped within the quarter. Backlog by reportable segment as of October 30, 2011 and October 31, 2010 was as follows: 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Silicon Systems Group 913 38 (17 ) 1,099 34 Applied Global Services 662 28 (15 ) 779 24 Display 337 14 (33 ) 505 16 Energy and Environmental Solutions 480 20 (44 ) 861 26 Total 2,392 100 (26 ) 3,244 100 Net Sales Net sales by geographic region, which are attributed according to the location of customers facilities, were as follows: 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 Change2010 over 2009 2009 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) China 2,574 24 65 1,557 16 145 635 13 Taiwan 2,093 20 (24 ) 2,750 29 168 1,026 21 Korea 1,263 12 (29 ) 1,768 19 166 664 13 Japan 912 9 19 768 8 7 718 14 Southeast Asia 592 5 2 578 6 129 252 5 Asia Pacific 7,434 70 7,421 78 125 3,295 66 North America(*) 1,963 19 72 1,147 12 19 966 19 Europe 1,120 11 14 981 10 30 753 15 Total 10,517 100 10 9,549 100 90 5,014 100 (*) Primarily the United States. Net sales of $10.5 billion for fiscal 2011 increased 10 percent from fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased industry investment in c Si solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment. 43 Table of Contents Customers in China, North America, and Taiwan combined represented 63 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2011. Net sales of $9.5 billion for fiscal 2010 increased 90 percent from fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales of semiconductor equipment. Customers in Taiwan and Korea combined represented 48 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2010. Net sales decreased 38 percent to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services to semiconductor and display customers, partially offset by increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment. Customers in Taiwan and North America combined represented 40 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2009. Net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 Change2010 over 2009 2009 ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (%) ($) (%) (In millions, except percentages) Silicon Systems Group 5,415 51 2 5,304 56 171 1,960 39 Applied Global Services 2,413 23 29 1,865 20 34 1,397 28 Display 699 7 (22 ) 899 9 79 502 10 Energy and Environmental Solutions 1,990 19 34 1,481 15 28 1,155 23 Total 10,517 100 10 9,549 100 90 5,014 100 For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, net sales in the Silicon Systems Group remained essentially flat while net sales in Energy and Environment Solutions and Applied Global Services increased due to increased demand for c Si equipment, and spare parts and refurbished equipment, respectively. Net sales in Display reflected a decrease during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to a weaker LCD market. For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, the relative share of total net sales in the Silicon Systems Group decreased, while the relative share of total net sales in Energy and Environmental Solutions increased. The increase in Energy and Environmental Solutions relative share of total net sales was due to increased demand for c Si equipment. Gross Margin Gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions, except percentages) Gross margin $ 4,360 $ 3,715 $ 1,431 $ 645 $ 2,284 Gross margin (% of net sales) 41 % 39 % 29 % 2 points 10 points The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was principally attributable to the absence of inventory related charges incurred in fiscal 2010 associated with SunFab thin film solar equipment. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was principally attributable to higher net sales, more favorable product mix, improved factory utilization, and continued cost control measures, offset in part by inventory related charges of $330 million associated with SunFab thin film solar equipment, which lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points. Gross margin during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 included $48 million, $32 million and $28 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Research, Development and Engineering Research, Development and Engineering (RD&E) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions) Research, development and engineering $ 1,118 $ 1,143 $ 934 $ (25 ) $ 209 44 Table of Contents Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. RD&E expenses were $1.1 billion (11 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2011, $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2010, and $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009. RD&E expense during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 included $46 million, $43 million and $50 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. In fiscal 2011, Applied developed logic and memory chip technologies to meet the requirements of manufacturing below the 22nm node. These systems were designed to help semiconductor customers continue their drive to pack more transistors in the same space using high k/metal gate technologies and double patterning processes. These technologies include low k dielectrics and curing for interconnect structures and high k dielectric materials and ALD processes for fabricating transistor gates. Applied also focused on processes to help customers build new three dimensional (3D) gate structures. In addition, Applied continued to focus on optimizing the cost effectiveness of through silicon via (TSV) technologies to enable their widespread implementation. TSV technologies permit interconnecting 3D chip stacks to enable better device performance, lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices. Applied is also investing in other new product development areas such as 450mm wafer systems. In the Display sector, Applied developed deposition systems to enable larger OLED, LCD and touch enabled displays. In solar, Applied focused on screen printing technology to keep pace with cell manufacturers new higher efficiency cell designs. Another key development area was smart capability, which brings a new level of precision and control to the PV production process. In fiscal 2010, Applied developed new technology to enable next generation 22nm and below chip designs. Applied also developed technology for TSVs. In the solar PV area, Applied continued the development of its precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering the cost of producing solar generated electricity through advanced c Si technology. RD&E also included activities to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy, production of LED devices for display backlighting and general lighting, and other products to enable energy conservation. In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for semiconductor customers new chip designs with 32nm and below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high k/metal gate technologies, as well as double patterning processes that enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology generations. Applied also focused on developing technology for manufacturing next generation displays. RD&E also included activities to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy and other products to enable energy conservation. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions) Selling, general and administrative $ 901 $ 942 $ 735 $ (41 ) $ 207 The decrease in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflected lower expenses as a result of the restructuring of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment that occurred in fiscal 2010. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 included $19 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Varian announced on May 4, 2011. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2010 included $10 million in transaction costs associated 45 Table of Contents with the acquisition of Semitool, Inc. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 reflected the elimination of temporary salary reductions and shutdowns that occurred in fiscal 2009, and the resumption of variable compensation programs. SG&A expenses were 9 percent of net sales in fiscal 2011, 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2010, and 15 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 included $52 million, $51 million and $69 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. Restructuring and Asset Impairments Restructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions) Restructuring and asset impairments, net $ (30 ) $ 246 $ 156 $ (276 ) $ 90 Results for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments of $60 million related to restructuring program charges recorded in prior years offset in part by asset impairment charges of $30 million primarily related to certain intangible assets. Results for fiscal 2010 included restructuring charges of $129 million related to two restructuring programs announced in fiscal 2010, and asset impairment charges of $117 million primarily related to a plan to restructure the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Results for fiscal 2009 included restructuring charges of $141 million primarily associated with a restructuring program announced in fiscal 2009, and asset impairment charges of $15 million related to wafer cleaning equipment. For further details, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on Sale of Facilities, net In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $39 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in North America and incurred a loss of $1 million on the transaction. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $60 million in proceeds from the sale of another property located in North America and incurred a gain of $28 million on the transaction. Interest and Other Expenses Interest and other expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions) Interest and other expense $ 59 $ 21 $ 21 $ 38 $ The increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest of $31 million payable on senior unsecured notes issued in fiscal 2011 and to fees of $8 million associated with a bridge loan facility that was entered into and terminated during fiscal 2011. Interest and other expense for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 remained essentially flat. Interest and Other Income, net Interest and other income, net for the past three fiscal years was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions) Interest and other income, net $ 42 $ 37 $ 48 $ 5 $ (11 ) 46 Table of Contents The increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in gains realized on sale of investment securities. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. Income Taxes Income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Change 2011 over 2010 2010 over 2009 (In millions, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 452 $ 449 $ (181 ) $ 3 $ 630 Effective income tax rate 19 % 32 % (37 )% (13) points 69 points The tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower than the rate for the fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in income in jurisdictions outside the U.S. with lower tax rates and a favorable U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit settlement. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 further benefited from tax incentives offered in several jurisdictions and from the December 2010 reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to its prior expiration in December 2009. The change in the fiscal 2010 tax rate from the fiscal 2009 rate was principally attributable to the income before taxes for fiscal 2010 as opposed to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit from the time it expired in December 2009. Applieds effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, and the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income. Segment Information Applied reports financial results in four segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include costs for share based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and RD&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these charges or adjustments pertain to a specific reportable segment. The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.

In fiscal 2011, customers in China accounted for an increased proportion of the Energy and Environment Solutions segments results compared to prior years, including 78 percent of new orders. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.8 for fiscal 2011 compared to 1.0 for fiscal 2010. The decrease for fiscal 2011 reflected a higher increase in net sales year over year relative to demand. The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment reported operating income of $453 million for fiscal 2011 compared to an operating loss of $466 million for fiscal 2010. Operating loss for fiscal 2010 included charges totaling $486 million associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions restructuring plan announced in July 2010. The increase in operating income for fiscal 2011 was also attributable to significantly higher net sales of c Si equipment and included favorable adjustments of $36 million related to the restructuring program announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 was due to higher manufacturing volume for c Si equipment. In 2011, the Applied Baccini Pegaso platform for next generation solar cell manufacturing was introduced. In fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges of $486 million that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment as described above, consisting of inventory related charges of $330 million related to SunFab thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of $108 million, employee severance charges of $45 million, and other costs of $3 million. Fiscal 2010 financial results compared to fiscal 2009 reflected increased demand for c Si products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab thin film solar manufacturing lines due to the challenging market conditions for utility scale solar. New orders increased by $553 million to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in orders reflected increased demand for c Si products, particularly wafering and metallization products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab lines. Net sales increased by $326 million to $1.5 billion for 52 Table of Contents fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Net sales for fiscal 2010 primarily reflected higher sales to c Si customers than in fiscal 2009. The relative share of the segments net sales attributable to SunFab customers decreased to 36 percent in fiscal 2010 from 44 percent in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, customers in China and Europe accounted for 88 percent of total net sales in this segment. The book to bill ratio increased to 1.0 for fiscal 2010 compared to 0.8 for fiscal 2009. The operating loss in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment increased by $232 million to $466 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to restructuring, asset impairment and inventory related charges of $486 million recognized in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, and lower net sales to SunFab customers, partially offset by increased sales of c Si products and cost control initiatives. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 reflected customer final acceptance of two SunFab lines. Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected reduced demand for c Si products over fiscal 2008 offset in part by higher demand for SunFab lines. New orders of $955 million in fiscal 2009 decreased from $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was primarily due to decreased demand from c Si customers and reflected the challenging global economic environment, solar manufacturers difficulties in obtaining cost effective capital, and a decrease in end demand. Net sales of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from $819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for SunFab lines. The operating loss of $234 million in fiscal 2009 increased from $206 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in RD&E expenses and unfavorable gross margins associated with initial SunFab line start ups, offset in part by cost control initiatives. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.8 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased demand, compared to 1.6 for fiscal 2008. In 2009, Applied introduced its Baccini Esatto Technology, a high precision, multi step printing capability designed to increase the efficiency of c Si solar cells. Business Combinations On May 4, 2011, Applied and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. This authoritative guidance permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two step goodwill impairment test is not required. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and earlier adoption is permitted. Applied elected to adopt this authoritative guidance in fiscal 2011. The implementation of this authoritative guidance had no impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. This guidance is effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied retrospectively. The implementation of this authoritative guidance will change only the presentation of comprehensive income and will have no impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In May 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This authoritative guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. This authoritative guidance also expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In December 2010, the FASB amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. This authoritative guidance modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter fiscal 2012. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations. In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on business combinations. This authoritative guidance requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose the revenue and 54 Table of Contents earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period. In addition, this authoritative guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This authoritative guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Applied will comply with this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $7.2 billion at October 30, 2011 from $3.9 billion at October 31, 2010, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes discussed below and cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 billion. Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 30,2011 October 31,2010 October 25,2009 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,960 $ 1,858 $ 1,577 Short term investments 283 727 638 Long term investments 931 1,307 1,052 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 7,174 $ 3,892 $ 3,267 A summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,426 $ 1,723 $ 333 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 710 $ (862 ) $ 112 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 960 $ (576 ) $ (281 ) Applied generated cash from operating activities of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2011, $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010, and $333 million in fiscal 2009. The primary sources of cash from operating activities for fiscal 2011 were net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, restructuring and asset impairments, and changes in components of working capital. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $211 million in fiscal 2011, $230 million in fiscal 2010, and $299 million in fiscal 2009. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $80 million in fiscal 2011, $157 million in fiscal 2010, and $43 million in fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding were 62 at the end of fiscal 2011, 58 at the end of fiscal 2010, and 75 at the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. Applieds working capital was $7.6 billion at October 30, 2011, $3.9 billion at October 31, 2010 and $3.7 billion at October 25, 2009. During fiscal 2011, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $276 million including interest. During fiscal 2010, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of approximately $130 million for the carryback of Applieds net operating loss from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2005. Applied generated $710 million of cash from investing activities in 2011. Applied used $862 million of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2010 and generated $112 million of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2009. Capital expenditures were $209 million in fiscal 2011, $169 million in fiscal 2010, $249 million in fiscal 2009. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 was offset by $99 million in proceeds received from the sale of two properties located in North America and $31 million in proceeds received from completed divestiture of certain assets held for sale. Capital expenditures for both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were primarily for the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system and the construction of a solar R&D/demonstration center in Xian, 55 Table of Contents China. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 also included investment to construct a facility in Singapore. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $789 million for fiscal 2011 and $361 million in fiscal 2009. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $370 million in fiscal 2010. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. In fiscal 2010, Applied acquired Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for $323 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Applied generated $960 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2011, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.75 billion, as discussed further below. Applied used cash for financing activities in the amount of $576 million for fiscal 2010 and $281 million for fiscal 2009. Financing activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $468 million in fiscal 2011, $350 million in fiscal 2010, and $23 million in fiscal 2009. In March 2010, Applieds Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $2.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in March 2013. Proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were $95 million in fiscal 2011, $129 million in fiscal 2010, and $62 million in fiscal 2009. The following table summarizes the dividends declared by Applieds Board of Directors during fiscal 2011: Date declared Record date Payable date Amount per share December 7, 2010 March 2, 2011 March 23, 2011 $ 0.07 March 8, 2011 June 1, 2011 June 22, 2011 $ 0.08 June 6, 2011 August 31, 2011 September 21, 2011 $ 0.08 September 13, 2011 November 23, 2011 December 14, 2011 $ 0.08 During fiscal 2010, Applieds Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per share. During fiscal 2009, Applieds Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each quarter. Cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $397 million, $349 million and $319 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applieds stockholders. Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed four year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in May 2015. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 30, 2011. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $105 million are with Japanese banks. Applieds ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both October 30, 2011 and October 31, 2010. In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. At October 30, 2011, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding. 56 Table of Contents In June 2011, Applied issued senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion. The following table summarizes the Notes issued in June 2011: Due Date Principal Amount Stated Interest Rate Effective Interest Rate Interest Pay Date Interest Pay Date (In millions) June 15, 2016 $ 400 2.650 % 2.666 % June 15 December 15 June 15, 2021 750 4.300 % 4.326 % June 15 December 15 June 15, 2041 600 5.850 % 5.879 % June 15 December 15 $ 1,750 The indenture governing the Notes includes certain covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 30, 2011. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long term debt. In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian. The aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. See Business Combinations section above. Applied funded the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances, including proceeds from the Notes. Following the acquisition of Varian Applieds cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $3.0 billion. After completion of the acquisition, Applieds credit ratings remained unchanged. The Companys long term credit ratings are A3 with Moodys Investors Services and A with Standard and Poors Ratings Services. The Companys short term credit ratings, which were initiated in July, 2011, are P 2 with Moodys Investors Services and A 2 with Standard and Poors Ratings Services. In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 30, 2011, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $58 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements. Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of October 30, 2011, Applied Materials Inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $191 million to cover these services. Applieds investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. As of October 30, 2011, less than $470 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by foreign subsidiaries of Applied. If these funds are needed for Applieds operations in the U.S., Applied may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Applieds intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to the U.S. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report. 57 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 30, 2011, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was $58 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements. Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of October 30, 2011, Applied Materials Inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $191 million to cover these services. Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $44 million for fiscal 2011, $44 million for fiscal 2010, and $55 million for fiscal 2009. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 30, 2011: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More Than5 Years (In millions) Long term debt obligations $ 1,951 $ $ 1 $ 400 $ 1,550 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 1,515 94 184 184 1,053 Operating lease obligations 108 33 36 18 21 Purchase obligations* 3,184 3,153 29 2 Other long term liabilities 221 42 57 42 80 $ 6,979 $ 3,322 $ 307 $ 646 $ 2,704 * Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods. In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the Company has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of October 30, 2011, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $59 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $1 million as of October 30, 2011 and $6 million as of October 31, 2010. All $1 million in interest and penalties is classified as long term payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 Table of Contents describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sellers price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. Each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. In addition, Applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition and results of operations. In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products. This guidance eliminated the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of managements best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable. Applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal 2010. The implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales compared to net sales under previous guidance, as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales. Warranty Costs Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty 59 Table of Contents support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that Applieds future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition. Non GAAP Results Management uses non GAAP results to evaluate the Companys operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the Companys business from the same perspective as the Companys management and facilitate comparisons of this periods results with prior periods. The non GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions, certain discrete tax items, certain acquisition related costs, investment impairments, and gain or loss on sale of facilities. These non GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non GAAP operating income for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Non GAAP operating loss for fiscal 2009 was $142 million. Non GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $1.7 billion or $1.30 per share and $1.2 billion or $0.88 per share, respectively. Non GAAP net loss for fiscal 2009 was $69 million or $0.05 per share. 61 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP and non GAAP results for the past three fiscal years: APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances. Applieds investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.1 billion at October 30, 2011. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 30, 2011, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $19 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary. At October 30, 2011, the carrying amount of debt issued by Applied was $1.9 billion with an estimated fair value of $2.2 billion. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Applieds debt issuances of approximately $215 million at October 30, 2011. Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2011.
