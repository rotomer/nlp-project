This MD&A should be read in conjunction with Applieds Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this Form 10 K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Overview: a summary of Applieds business and measurementsResults of Operations: a discussion of operating resultsSegment Information: a discussion of segment operating resultsBusiness Combinations: a summary or overview of acquired businessesRecent Accounting Pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to Applieds consolidated financial statementsFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial positionOff Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsCritical Accounting Policies: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimatesNon GAAP Results: a presentation of results reconciling GAAP to non GAAP measuresOverviewApplied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applieds customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar PV cells and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect Applieds operations is set forth under Risk Factors in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. Applieds broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.Applieds results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products. Each of Applieds businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and technological advances in fabrication processes. In light of this cyclicality, Applieds results can vary significantly year over year, as well as quarter over quarter.34Table of ContentsThe following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years: ChangeFiscal Year2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages)New orders$8,037 $10,142 $10,249 $(2,105) $(107)Net sales$8,719 $10,517 $9,549 $(1,798) $968Gross margin$3,313 $4,360 $3,715 $(1,047) $645Gross margin percent38.0% 41.5% 38.9% (3.5) points 2.6 pointsOperating income$411 $2,398 $1,384 $(1,987) $1,014Operating margin percent4.7% 22.8% 14.5% (18.1) points 8.3 pointsNet income$109 $1,926 $938 $(1,817) $988Earnings per diluted share$0.09 $1.45 $0.70 $(1.36) $0.75Non GAAP Results Gross margin$3,566 $4,397 $3,788 $(831) $609Gross margin percent40.9% 41.8% 39.7% (0.9) points 2.1 pointsOperating income$1,379 $2,411 $1,731 $(1,032) $680Operating margin percent15.8% 22.9% 18.1% (7.1) points 4.8 pointsNet income$960 $1,723 $1,181 $(763) $542Earnings per diluted share$0.75 $1.30 $0.88 $(0.55) $0.42Reconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below. Fiscal 2012 and 2011 each contained 52 weeks each, while fiscal 2010 contained 53 weeks.Fiscal 2012 was a year characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment, which is Applieds largest business, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment. Mobility, connectivity and cloud computing trends drove the semiconductor industry spending, with mobility as the biggest influence. Applied also completed its acquisition of Varian in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Consumer buying patterns for electronic products, combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration, contributed to a seasonality effect, with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal 2012, followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal 2012, characterized by decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging. As with the semiconductor industry, demand for mobility products, such as smartphones and tablets, significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry. In the solar industry, fiscal 2012 was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity, which led to significantly reduced demand for c Si equipment, as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.The first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflected increased demand across all segments except Display due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions than in fiscal 2010, although demand softened for semiconductor, LCD and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal 2011. Towards the end of fiscal 2011, the semiconductor, LCD and solar industries were negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the LCD and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity.Applieds strategic priorities for 2013 include expanding market share in wafer fab equipment and growing its technical capabilities, extending its technology leadership in solar and display equipment and enhancing its organization in key product areas. In semiconductor equipment, Applied intends to increase investment in 300mm and 450mm research and development and enhance the technical field team. In addition, Applied plans to make selective investments in developing enabling technologies for display and solar products.35Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table presents certain quarterly and full fiscal year financial information: Fiscal Quarter FiscalYear First Second Third Fourth (In millions, except per share amounts)2012: New orders$2,008 $2,765 $1,799 $1,465 $8,037Net sales$2,189 $2,541 $2,343 $1,646 $8,719Gross margin$786 $1,011 $930 $586 $3,313Operating income (loss)$179 $409 $322 $(499) $411Net income (loss)$117 $289 $218 $(515) $109Earnings (loss) per diluted share$0.09 $0.22 $0.17 $(0.42) $0.092011: New orders$2,971 $3,185 $2,390 $1,596 $10,142Net sales$2,686 $2,862 $2,787 $2,182 $10,517Gross margin$1,136 $1,189 $1,184 $852 $4,360Operating income$674 $677 $687 $361 $2,398Net income$506 $489 $476 $456 $1,926Earnings per diluted share$0.38 $0.37 $0.36 $0.34 $1.452010: New orders$1,965 $2,533 $2,725 $3,026 $10,249Net sales$1,849 $2,296 $2,518 $2,886 $9,549Gross margin$711 $927 $860 $1,217 $3,715Operating income$116 $386 $183 $699 $1,384Net income$83 $264 $123 $468 $938Earnings per diluted share$0.06 $0.20 $0.09 $0.35 $0.70Orders and sales for manufacturing equipment historically has been volatile across all segments as a result of sudden changes in demand and other factors, including global economic and market conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication processes. Applieds business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. As a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment, there were significant fluctuations in Applieds quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and across the three fiscal years. As of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011, the semiconductor, display and solar equipment industries were each in a capacity driven downturn. The nature and timing of a recovery in capital equipment investment are expected to depend largely on the macroeconomic environment.36Table of ContentsNew OrdersNew orders by geographic region, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows: 2012 Change2012 over 2011 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Taiwan$2,155 27% (4)% $2,235 22% (19)% $2,760 27%China403 5% (80)% 2,066 20% (4)% 2,155 21%Korea1,784 22% 39% 1,286 13% (24)% 1,703 17%Japan600 7% (40)% 1,001 10% 35% 741 7%Southeast Asia283 4% (39)% 463 5% (31)% 675 7%Asia Pacific5,225 65% (26)% 7,051 70% (12)% 8,034 79%United States1,995 25% (4)% 2,069 20% 53% 1,348 13%Europe817 10% (20)% 1,022 10% 18% 867 8%Total$8,037 100% (21)% $10,142 100% (1)% $10,249 100% New orders for fiscal 2012 decreased from fiscal 2011, reflecting a steep decline in demand for c Si solar equipment, combined with reduced demand for LCD TV and semiconductor equipment, partially offset by new orders of $1.0 billion attributable to Varian. The reduction in new orders from customers in China primarily reflected the decreased investments in the solar industry due to overcapacity. Customers in Taiwan, United States and Korea together represented 74 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $1.5 billion, down 19 percent from the prior quarter, reflecting lower semiconductor equipment demand, partially offset by modest order increases in other segments.New orders for fiscal 2011 were slightly down from fiscal 2010, primarily attributable to decreased demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and decreased demand for LCD TV equipment, partially offset by increased demand for touch panel tools from display customers and increased demand for c Si equipment from solar manufacturers. Customers in Taiwan, United States and China together represented 62 percent of total new orders for fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $1.6 billion, down 33 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2011.New orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2012 Change2012 over 2011 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Silicon Systems Group$5,294 66% (4)% $5,489 54% (5)% $5,759 56%Applied Global Services2,274 28% (3)% 2,333 23% 7% 2,183 21%Display274 4% (57)% 636 6% (20)% 799 8%Energy and Environmental Solutions195 2% (88)% 1,684 17% 12% 1,508 15%Total$8,037 100% (21)% $10,142 100% (1)% $10,249 100%New orders for fiscal 2012 decreased for all segments compared to the same periods in the prior year, mostly due to the excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and the continued down cycle in the display industry, partially offset by the addition of orders attributable to Varian of $1.0 billion. The Silicon Systems Groups and Applied Global Services relative share of total new orders increased compared to the prior year as a result of the addition of Varian and the sharp decrease in orders in Display and Energy and Environmental Solutions.For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, new orders by segment as well as the relative share of total new orders for the Silicon Systems Group and Display decreased, while new orders by segment as well as the relative share of new orders in Applied Global Services and Energy and Environmental Solutions increased.37Table of ContentsChanges in backlog during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows: 2012 2011 (In millions)Beginning balance$2,392 $3,244New orders8,037 10,142Net sales(8,719) (10,517)Net adjustments(104) (477)Ending balance$1,606 $2,392Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. Applieds backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. Approximately 75 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2012 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2013.Applieds backlog was $1.6 billion at October 28, 2012 as compared to $2.4 billion at October 30, 2011. Backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2012 and totaled $104 million, primarily consisting of customer cancellations. Backlog by reportable segment as of October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011 was as follows: 2012 Change2012 over 2011 2011 (In millions, except percentages)Silicon Systems Group$705 44% (23)% $913 38%Applied Global Services580 36% (12)% 662 28%Display206 13% (39)% 337 14%Energy and Environmental Solutions115 7% (76)% 480 20%Total$1,606 100% (33)% $2,392 100%Backlog decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 across all segments reflecting decreased demand for semiconductor, LCD and solar equipment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, approximately 53 percent of net sales in the Silicon Systems Group, Applieds largest business segment, were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, up from 45 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.Net SalesNet sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows: 2012 Change2012 over 2011 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Taiwan2,411 28% 15% 2,093 20% (24)% 2,750 29%China783 9% (70)% 2,574 24% 65% 1,557 16%Korea1,897 22% 50% 1,263 12% (29)% 1,768 19%Japan704 8% (23)% 912 9% 19% 768 8%Southeast Asia312 3% (47)% 592 5% 2% 578 6%Asia Pacific6,107 70% (18)% 7,434 70% % 7,421 78%United States1,749 20% (11)% 1,963 19% 71% 1,147 12%Europe863 10% (23)% 1,120 11% 14% 981 10%Total$8,719 100% (17)% $10,517 100% 10% $9,549 100%38Table of ContentsNet sales for fiscal 2012 decreased from the prior year, primarily due to decreased industry investment in c Si solar products and LCD TV equipment, partially offset by sales attributable to Varian. Net sales attributable to Varian were $1.0 billion for fiscal 2012. The reduction in net sales from customers in China primarily reflected the decreased investments in the solar and display industries due to overcapacity. Customers in Taiwan, Korea and United States combined represented 70 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, net sales were $1.6 billion, down 30 percent from the prior quarter, led by a reduction in semiconductor equipment sales. Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased from fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased industry investment in c Si solar equipment and higher sales of spares and refurbished semiconductor equipment. Customers in China, Taiwan and United States combined represented 63 percent of total net sales in fiscal 2011.Net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2012 Change2012 over 2011 2011 Change2011 over 2010 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Silicon Systems Group$5,536 64% 2% $5,415 51% 2% $5,304 56%Applied Global Services2,285 26% (5)% 2,413 23% 29% 1,865 20%Display473 5% (32)% 699 7% (22)% 899 9%Energy and Environmental Solutions425 5% (79)% 1,990 19% 34% 1,481 15%Total$8,719 100% (17)% $10,517 100% 10% $9,549 100%For fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, net sales in the Silicon Systems Group increased slightly while net sales across all other segments decreased. The decrease reflected lower investments in c Si solar and LCD TV equipment, partially offset by sales attributable to Varian. The Silicon Systems Groups relative share of total net sales increased compared to the prior year and remains the largest contributor of net sales.For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, net sales in the Silicon Systems Group remained essentially flat while net sales in Energy and Environment Solutions and Applied Global Services increased due to increased demand for c Si equipment, and spare parts and refurbished equipment, respectively. Net sales in Display decreased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to a weaker LCD TV market. For fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, the relative share of total net sales in the Silicon Systems Group decreased, while the relative share of total net sales in Energy and Environmental Solutions increased. The increase in Energy and Environmental Solutions relative share of total net sales was due to increased demand for c Si equipment.Gross MarginGross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Gross margin$3,313 $4,360 $3,715 $(1,047) $645Gross margin (% of net sales)38.0% 41.5% 38.9% (3.5) points 2.6 pointsNon GAAP Results Gross margin$3,566 $4,397 $3,788 $(831) $609Gross margin (% of net sales)40.9% 41.8% 39.7% (0.9) points 2.1 pointsReconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below.Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to changes in segment and customer mix, inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization associated with purchase accounting, additional inventory reserves and lower net sales, partially offset by sales for a single thin film solar production line, for which inventory was fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012. Inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization, mostly associated with the acquisition of Varian, were $253 million in fiscal 2012. Inventory charges of approximately $290 million were recorded in fiscal 2012 as a result of the softening of demand for semiconductor related businesses and continued weakness in the solar industry. Of the total inventory charges during fiscal 2012, $13 million were recorded in connection with the restructuring of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. The increase in gross margin and non GAAP gross margin in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was principally 39Table of Contentsattributable to the inventory related charges of $330 million incurred in fiscal 2010 associated with SunFab thin film solar equipment, which lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately 3 percentage points. Gross margin during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $54 million, $48 million and $32 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense.Research, Development and EngineeringResearch, Development and Engineering (RD&E) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions)Research, development and engineering$1,237 $1,118 $1,143 $119 $(25)Applieds future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. The increase in RD&E for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the RD&E expenses related to Varian of approximately $180 million and continued investment in the development of smaller linewidths and 450mm wafer equipment, partially offset by lower investments in solar R&D projects and the cessation of LED equipment development. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applieds existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. RD&E expense during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $54 million, $46 million and $43 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense. In fiscal 2012, Applied developed transistor and interconnect technologies for scaling chip features to the 14nm node and beyond. Applied focused on processes to enable the formation of three dimensional transistor and memory storage architectures that improve the performance and energy efficiency of devices. For advanced interconnects, Applied focused on process technology for the void free filling of smaller, narrower wiring structures with copper material. Complementary to this technology was the optimization of low k films to increase device performance and lengthen battery life. Efforts continued on bringing down the cost of through silicon via (TSV) technology for packaging chips with the development of new low temperature conformal films that are also applicable for new backside illuminated image sensors. TSV technologies permit interconnecting 3D chip stacks to enable better device performance, lower power consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices. The Company also continued to invest in the development of 450mm wafer equipment. For LCD manufacturing, Applied developed new processes to fabricate metal oxide based transistors, which provide smaller, faster switching pixels for higher resolution displays. In solar, Applied focused on technology to increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of solar cells by optimizing the structure of its conducting lines.In fiscal 2011, Applied developed logic and memory chip technologies to meet the requirements of manufacturing below the 22nm node. These systems were designed to help semiconductor customers continue their drive to pack more transistors in the same space using high k/metal gate technologies and double patterning processes. These technologies include low k dielectrics and curing for interconnect structures and high k dielectric materials and ALD processes for fabricating transistor gates. Applied also focused on processes to help customers build new three dimensional (3D) gate structures. In addition, Applied continued to focus on optimizing the cost effectiveness of TSV technologies to enable their widespread implementation. Applied also invested in other new product development areas such as 450mm wafer systems. For LCD manufacturing, Applied developed deposition systems to enable larger organic light emitting diode (OLED), LCD and touch enabled displays. In solar, Applied focused on screen printing technology to keep pace with cell manufacturers new higher efficiency cell designs. Another key development area was smart capability, which brings a new level of precision and control to the PV production process.In fiscal 2010, Applied developed new technology to enable next generation 22nm and below chip designs. Applied also developed technology for TSVs. In the solar PV area, Applied continued the development of its precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering the cost of producing solar generated electricity through advanced c Si technology. RD&E also included activities to develop products that enable lower cost production of solar energy, production of LED devices for display backlighting and general lighting, and other products to enable energy conservation.40Table of ContentsSelling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions)Selling, general and administrative$1,076 $901 $942 $175 $(41)The increase in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to acquisition related costs and other SG&A expenses incurred in connection with Varian which totaled $190 million, partially offset by lower variable compensation and savings associated with temporary shutdowns. The decrease in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflected lower expenses as a result of the restructuring of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment that occurred in fiscal 2010. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 included $19 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Varian, while fiscal 2010 included $10 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Semitool, Inc. SG&A expenses during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 included $74 million, $52 million and $51 million, respectively, of share based compensation expense.Impairment of GoodwillApplied tested goodwill of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit for potential impairment during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 in light of second quarter developments that included current industry trends, financial performance, weaker short term outlooks, and other adverse operating conditions within the solar industry. The results of the first step of the impairment test indicated that goodwill of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit was not impaired at that time. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied noted no events that would significantly impact the results of the impairment test performed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the solar industry faced increasing challenges of solar panel manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook, leading to the deterioration of the solar equipment market and Applieds customers financial condition, coupled with lower market valuations. Taking these factors into account, Applied reassessed its financial outlook of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit, and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of Energy and Environmental Solutions goodwill. Accordingly, Applied performed the two step impairment test and concluded that the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value and recorded a $421 million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, and Display reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for these reporting units.The evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time. For further details, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsRestructuring and Asset ImpairmentsRestructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions)Restructuring and asset impairments, net$168 $(30) $246 $198 $(276)On October 3, 2012, Applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. Under this plan, Applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that are expected to affect approximately 900 to 1,300 positions, or 6 percent to 9 percent of its global workforce. The voluntary retirement program was available to certain U.S. employees who meet minimum age and length of service requirements, as well as other business specific criteria. Under the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan, Applied also implemented other workforce reduction actions globally across multiple business segments and functions, the extent of which depended on the number of employees who participate in the voluntary retirement program and other considerations.During fiscal 2012, Applied incurred severance and other employee related costs of $106 million related to the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan, which was based on an estimated number of employees impacted by the workforce reduction. Incremental charges will coincide with the acceptances of the voluntary retirement program in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Due to the nature of this plan, these costs are subject to subsequent adjustments due to multiple assumptions and estimates used, including with respect to: the number and job levels of employees who participate in the voluntary retirement program, the nature and extent of additional workforce actions required to complete this plan, and other factors. On May 10, 2012, Applied announced a plan (the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan) to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light emitting diode (LED) equipment markets. As of October 28, 2012, as part of the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan, Applied was still in the process of relocating certain manufacturing, business operations and customer support functions of its precision wafering systems business and has ceased LED development activities. During fiscal 2012, Applied incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $48 million related to this plan.Also in fiscal 2012, Applied incurred severance costs of $14 million associated with the integration of Varian.Results for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments of $60 million related to restructuring program charges recorded in prior years, offset in part by asset impairment charges of $30 million primarily related to certain intangible assets.Results for fiscal 2010 included restructuring charges of $129 million related to two restructuring programs announced in fiscal 2010, and asset impairment charges of $117 million primarily related to a plan to restructure the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.For further details, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Gain on Sale of Facilities, netIn the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $39 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in North America and incurred a loss of $1 million on the transaction. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $60 million in proceeds from the sale of another property located in North America and incurred a gain of $28 million on the transaction.Impairments of Strategic InvestmentsEquity investments in privately held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other than temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. If Applied determines that an other than temporary impairment has occurred, the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information, such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, Applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privately held companies were other than temporarily impaired and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of $17 million, $3 million and $13 million, respectively.42Table of ContentsInterest and Other ExpensesInterest and other expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions)Interest and other expense$95 $59 $21 $36 $38The increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is mainly due to the full year of interest expense incurred on the senior unsecured notes issued in June 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of Varian. The increase in interest and other expense for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest of $31 million payable on senior unsecured notes issued in fiscal 2011 and to fees of $8 million associated with a bridge loan facility that was entered into and terminated during fiscal 2011. Interest and Other Income, netInterest and other income, net for the past three fiscal years was as follows: Change2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions)Interest and other income, net$17 $42 $37 $(25) $5The decrease in interest and other income in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is due to lower cash and investment balances after completion of the acquisition of Varian, decreased realized gains on investment securities, and lower interest rates. The increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in gains realized on sale of investment securities. Income TaxesIncome tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 2010 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$207 $452 $449 $(245) $3Effective income tax rate65.5% 19.0% 32.4% 46.5 points (13.4) pointsThe effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 is significantly higher than the rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to the recording of goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2012, which are not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the tax rate for fiscal 2011 benefited from a favorable U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit settlement. The tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 both benefited from tax incentives offered in several jurisdictions and fiscal 2011 benefited from the December 2010 reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to its prior expiration in December 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did not include the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit from the time it expired in December 2009. Applieds effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of Applieds pre tax income.43Table of ContentsSegment InformationApplied reports financial results in four segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include costs for share based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and RD&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these charges or adjustments pertain to a specific reportable segment.The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.Silicon Systems Group SegmentThe Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. Development efforts are focused on solving customers key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. The mobility trend remains the biggest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to deliver high performance, low power processors and affordable solid state storage in a small form factor.Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages and ratios)New orders$5,294 $5,489 $5,759 $(195) (4)% $(270) (5)%Net sales5,536 5,415 5,304 121 2% 111 2%Book to bill ratio1.0 1.0 1.1 Operating income1,243 1,764 1,892 (521) (30)% (128) (7)%Operating margin22.5% 32.6% 35.7% (10.1) points (3.1) pointsNon GAAP Results Operating income$1,537 $1,779 $1,919 (242) (14)% (140) (7)%Operating margin27.8% 32.9% 36.2% (5.1) points (3.3) pointsReconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below.New orders for the Silicon Systems Group by end use application for the past three fiscal years were as follows: 2012 2011 2010Foundry62% 47% 41%Memory22% 28% 43%Logic and other16% 25% 16% 100% 100% 100%44Table of ContentsThe following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Silicon Systems Group segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years: Change 2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages)Taiwan$1,744 $1,309 $1,976 $435 33% $(667) (34)%Customers in Taiwan accounted for 32 percent, 24 percent and 37 percent of the total net sales of the Silicon Systems Group in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customers in Korea and United States together contributed 49 percent, 43 percent and 36 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Fiscal 2012 financial results reflected continued uncertain global economic conditions that led to decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment compared to fiscal 2011, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $741 million, a decrease of 36 percent compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in new orders in fiscal 2012 from the prior year was primarily due to reduced demand from memory and logic customers, partially offset by the addition of Varian. Net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2012 from the prior year due to the addition of net sales attributable to Varian, partially offset by decreased investment from memory and logic customers. Three customers accounted for 60 percent of net sales in this segment in fiscal 2012. Approximately 53 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, which remained flat from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Operating income and non GAAP operating income for fiscal 2012 decreased compared to fiscal 2011, due to changes in customer and product mix with the inclusion of Varian, costs associated with Varian operations, and additional inventory charges. In fiscal 2012, inventory charges of approximately $134 million were recorded for the segment. Operating income for fiscal 2012 also included Varian acquisition related costs of $290 million and severance charges of $4 million associated with the integration of Varian.Fiscal 2011 financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment compared to fiscal 2010, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2011, due primarily to uncertain global economic conditions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $925 million, a decrease of 25 percent compared to the prior quarter. For fiscal 2011, new orders decreased compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to reduced demand from memory customers. Net sales increased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased investment by logic customers. Three customers accounted for 52 percent of net sales in this segment in fiscal 2011. Approximately 45 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, down from 49 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Operating income and non GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year. The decrease was due in part to a settlement agreement between Applied and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) that provided for volume based rebates and other incentives to Samsung. The decrease was also due to operating expenses incurred as a result of headcount increases during fiscal 2011. Applied Global Services SegmentThe Applied Global Services segment encompasses spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar manufacturing. These products are designed to improve customers operating efficiency, optimize their operating costs, and lessen the environmental impact of their factories. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.Since the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied also accounts for thin film solar products, including the fully integrated SunFab thin film solar production line, under the Applied Global Services segment. As part of a restructuring of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in fiscal 2010, Applied discontinued sales of SunFab lines to new customers but continues to support existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment as these products are considered to have reached a particular stage in the product lifecycle.45Table of ContentsCertain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages and ratios)New orders$2,274 $2,333 $2,183 $(59) (3)% $150 7%Net sales2,285 2,413 1,865 (128) (5)% 548 29%Book to bill ratio1.0 1.0 1.2 Operating income502 482 337 20 4% 145 43%Operating margin22.0% 20.0% 18.1% 2.0 points 1.9 pointsNon GAAP Results Operating income530 513 348 17 3% 165 47%Operating margin23.2% 21.3% 18.7% 1.9 points 2.6 pointsReconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below.There were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Applied Global Services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.For fiscal 2012, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower sales of 200mm systems, offset in part by the addition of Varian. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $576 million, an increase of 8 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012, reflecting seasonal effect of annual contract renewals. Net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $621 million and included $85 million in sales for a single thin film solar production line. Operating income and non GAAP operating income increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the sale of the thin film solar line, for which inventory had been fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012 partially offset by inventory charges of approximately $57 million. Operating income also included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $15 million associated with the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan and the integration of Varian.Fiscal 2011 financial results reflected increased demand for services over fiscal 2010. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $564 million, a decrease of 8 percent compared to the prior quarter. For fiscal 2011, new orders increased compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to higher demand for spare parts and refurbished equipment. Net sales increased for fiscal 2011, a record for the segment, compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales in spare parts and refurbished equipment and included $71 million in sales for two thin film solar production lines. Operating income and non GAAP operating income increased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting increased sales of spare parts and refurbished equipment.46Table of ContentsDisplay SegmentThe Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs, OLEDs, and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers (PCs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer oriented devices. The segment is focused on expanding market share by differentiation with larger scale manufacturing equipment for TVs, entry into new markets such as the LTPS, metal oxide, and touch panel sectors, and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. Historically, display industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced LCD TVs, for which demand has slowed significantly. More recently, mobility related markets have represented the majority of this segments orders and net sales.Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages and ratios)New orders$274 $636 $799 $(362) (57)% $(163) (20)%Net sales473 699 899 (226) (32)% (200) (22)%Book to bill ratio0.6 0.9 0.9 Operating income25 147 267 (122) (83)% (120) (45)%Operating margin5.3% 21.0% 29.7% (15.7) points (8.7) pointsNon GAAP Results Operating income$32 $154 $274 (122) (79)% (120) (44)%Operating margin6.8% 22.0% 30.5% (15.2) points (8.5) pointsReconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below.The following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years: Change 2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages)China$133 $330 $162 $(197) (60)% $168 104 %Taiwan$179 $216 $311 $(37) (17)% $(95) (31)%Korea$88 $111 $334 $(23) (21)% $(223) (67)%In fiscal 2012, customers in China accounted for 28 percent of total net sales for the Display segment compared to 47 percent in fiscal 2011, and 18 percent in fiscal 2010. Customers in Taiwan accounted for 38 percent of total net sales for the segment in fiscal 2012 compared to 31 percent in fiscal 2011, and 35 percent in fiscal 2010. Customers in Korea accounted for 19 percent of total net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2012 compared to 16 percent in fiscal 2011, and 37 percent in fiscal 2010.Fiscal 2012 operating results reflected a continued overcapacity in the large substrate LCD TV equipment industry that resulted in decreased new orders and net sales in fiscal 2012. The downturn in the LCD TV equipment industry was partially offset by increased demand for advanced mobile display equipment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders remained at low levels of $83 million, but increased compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Four customers accounted for 60 percent of net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 operating results reflected a downturn in demand for equipment to manufacture LCD TV products that resulted in an extremely low level of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $20 million, a decrease of 91 percent compared to the prior quarter. For fiscal 2011, new orders decreased compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in new orders reflected customers decisions to delay investment in new LCD TV capacity, which was partially offset by increased demand for LTPS and touch panel systems, although this demand also softened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as an initial build out of manufacturing capacity was absorbed. Net sales decreased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in net sales reflected a decline in spending for LCD TV equipment, as customers delayed their investments, including plans for manufacturing in China, partially offset by increased demand for equipment to manufacture new mobile devices like smart phones and tablets. Operating income decreased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflecting an unfavorable product mix. Three customers accounted for 54 percent of net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2011. The decrease in operating margin and non GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to changes in product mix. 47Table of ContentsEnergy and Environmental Solutions SegmentThe Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products for fabricating c Si solar PVs, high throughput roll to roll coating systems for flexible electronics, and web products. This business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency. While end demand for solar PVs has been robust over the last several years, investment levels in capital equipment have experienced considerable volatility. Current global solar PV production capacity exceeds anticipated near term demand, which has caused solar PV manufacturers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations.Until the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment included the fully integrated SunFab production line for manufacturing thin film solar panels. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied announced a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in response to adverse market conditions for thin film solar. As a result, Applied discontinued sales of SunFab lines to new customers, but continues to support existing SunFab line customers with services, upgrades and capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment.Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Change2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages and ratios)New orders$195 $1,684 $1,508 $(1,489) (88)% $176 12%Net sales425 1,990 1,481 (1,565) (79)% 509 34%Book to bill ratio0.5 0.8 1.0 Operating income (loss)(668) 453 (466) (1,121) (247)% 919 (197)%Operating margin(157.2)% 22.8% (31.5)% (180.0) points 54.3 pointsNon GAAP Results Operating income (loss)(184) 444 (267) (628) (141)% 711 (266)%Operating margin(43.3)% 22.3% (18.0)% (65.6) points 40.3 pointsReconciliations of non GAAP measures are presented under "Non GAAP Results" below.The following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years: Change 2012 2011 20102012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 (In millions, except percentages)China$210 $1,584 $935 $(1,374) (87)% $649 69%In fiscal 2012, customers in China accounted for 49 percent of total net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment compared to 80 percent in fiscal 2011, and 63 percent in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2012 financial results reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, the impairment of a portion of the segments goodwill and a restructuring program. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $65 million, an increase of 86 percent compared to the prior quarters low level of $35 million in new orders. During fiscal 2012, 65 percent of the segments net sales were from products shipped in earlier periods. For fiscal 2012, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2011 reflecting significantly decreased demand for c Si equipment. The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment reported operating loss of $668 million for fiscal 2012 compared to an operating income of $453 million for fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower sales, additional inventory charges, impairment and restructuring charges during the year. Inventory charges of $96 million were recorded in fiscal 2012. 48Table of ContentsOn May 10, 2012, Applied announced a plan to restructure the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and LED equipment markets. During fiscal 2012, Applied incurred severance and asset impairment charges totaling $48 million associated with this plan, of which $38 million was included in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Of the total inventory charges recorded in fiscal 2012, $13 million was associated with the restructuring. Details on restructuring and asset impairment charges are included in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied performed the two step impairment test and concluded that the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value and recorded $421 million of goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. See discussion in the Impairment of Goodwill section above and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.Fiscal 2011 financial results reflected increased demand for c Si products in the first half of the year, followed by a steep decline in the second half of fiscal 2011 due to excess manufacturing capacity and customers decreased access to capital. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, new orders were $86 million, a decrease of 73 percent compared to the prior quarter. For fiscal 2011, new orders increased compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in new orders for fiscal 2011 reflected significantly increased demand for c Si equipment, particularly wafering and metallization products. The increased demand was partially driven by government incentives for solar. Net sales increased for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2011 primarily reflected higher sales to c Si customers. Net sales in fiscal 2010 included $539 million from sales of SunFab thin film lines. There were no sales of SunFab thin film lines recognized in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, customers in China accounted for an increased proportion of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segments results compared to prior years, including 78 percent of new orders. The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment reported operating income of $453 million for fiscal 2011 compared to an operating loss of $466 million for fiscal 2010. Operating loss for fiscal 2010 included charges totaling $486 million associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions restructuring plan announced in July 2010, consisting of inventory related charges of $330 million related to SunFab thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of $108 million, employee severance charges of $45 million, and other costs of $3 million.The increase in operating income for fiscal 2011 was also attributable to significantly higher net sales of c Si equipment and included favorable adjustments of $36 million related to the restructuring program announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 was due to higher manufacturing volume for c Si equipment. Business CombinationsOn November 10, 2011, Applied completed the acquisition of Varian, a public company manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment and the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers globally, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and assumed earned equity awards of $27 million, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) dated as of May 3, 2011. Applieds primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the acquired business is included in results for the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments.Varian designs, markets, manufactures and services ion implantation systems. These systems are primarily used in the manufacture of transistors, which are a basic building block of ICs or microchips. Ion implantation systems create a beam of electrically charged particles called ions, which are implanted into transistor structures at precise locations and depths, changing the electrical properties of the semiconductor device. These implantation systems may also be used in other areas of IC manufacture for modifying the material properties of the semiconductor devices, as well as in manufacturing crystalline silicon solar cells and LEDs.Applied funded the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. On June 8, 2011, Applied issued senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion and used the net proceeds of the Notes to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition. The indenture governing the Notes includes certain covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 28, 2012. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long term debt.On December 21, 2009, Applied acquired Semitool, Inc., a public company based in the state of Montana, for a purchase price of $323 million in cash, net of cash acquired, pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent short form merger. The acquired business is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by semiconductor packaging and manufacturing companies globally. Applieds primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement its existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. The acquired business is included in results for the Silicon Systems Group segment.49Table of ContentsSemitool is a leading provider of wet chemical processing equipment, targeting wafer surface preparation and ECD plating applications for all areas of wafer fabrication, including device packaging. Semitools solutions address critical applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process, and enable its customers to manufacture more advanced semiconductor devices that feature higher levels of performance.In November 2009, Applied acquired substantially all the assets, including the intellectual property, of Advent Solar, a developer of advanced technology for c Si solar photovoltaic cells and modules (PVs), for a purchase price of $14 million. This acquisition complemented Applieds portfolio of solar PV technologies and enhanced Applieds opportunities in the c Si equipment market. The acquisition is included in results for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.For further details, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The authoritative guidance also required presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other compressive income are presented, which was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in December 2011. Applied early adopted this authoritative guidance in fiscal 2012. The implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have an impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations.In July 2012, the FASB amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. This authoritative guidance gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired. To perform a qualitative assessment, a company must identify and evaluate changes in economic, industry and company specific events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset. If a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount, it would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in that year. This authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Applieds financial position or results of operations.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesApplieds cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased to $3.0 billion at October 28, 2012 from $7.2 billion at October 30, 2011. The decrease in cash was the result of the completion of the acquisition of Varian during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, and cash paid for stock repurchases and dividends, which were partially offset by cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and investments at October 30, 2011 included net proceeds from the issuance of $1.75 billion of senior secured notes that were issued to assist in funding the Varian acquisition.Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,392 $5,960Short term investments545 283Long term investments1,055 931Total cash, cash equivalents and investments$2,992 $7,17450Table of ContentsA summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,851 $2,429 $1,723Cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(4,660) $707 $(862)Cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(1,754) $960 $(576)The primary sources of cash from operating activities for fiscal 2012 were net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, impairment of goodwill, restructuring and asset impairments, deferred income taxes and changes in components of working capital. Applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2012. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of $211 million in fiscal 2011, and $230 million in fiscal 2010. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $93 million in fiscal 2012, $80 million in fiscal 2011, and $157 million in fiscal 2010. Applieds working capital was $2.8 billion at October 28, 2012 and $7.6 billion at October 30, 2011. During fiscal 2011, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $276 million including interest. During fiscal 2010, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of approximately $130 million for the carryback of Applieds net operating loss from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2005.Days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated are: 2012 2011 2010 Days sales outstanding67 62 58Days inventory outstanding109 116 84Days payable outstanding34 33 36Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. The improving trend for days inventory outstanding from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 represents increased cash flows from changes in inventory during the year. The change in inventory resulted from lower net sales and consequently, lower purchases, for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year. The cash flow increase from the improved days inventory outstanding reflecting lower business volume was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits and deferred revenues. Accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses provided an aggregate of $737 million in cash flows in fiscal 2012 and used an aggregate amount of $92 million in fiscal 2011 and $153 million in fiscal 2010.Applied used $4.7 billion of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2012 and $862 million in fiscal 2010. Applied generated $707 million of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures were $162 million in fiscal 2012, $209 million in fiscal 2011, and $169 million in fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 were primarily for various information technology expenditures in North America, including the addition of Varian, and expansion of semiconductor assembly centers in Singapore. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 were offset by $99 million in proceeds received from the sale of two properties located in North America and $31 million in proceeds received from the completed divestiture of certain assets held for sale. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were primarily for the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software system and the construction of a solar R&D/demonstration center in Xian, China. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 also included investment to construct a facility in Singapore. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $308 million for fiscal 2012 and $370 million in fiscal 2010, while proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $786 million for fiscal 2011.Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. In fiscal 2012, Applied acquired Varian for $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2010, Applied acquired Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for $323 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on business acquisitions.51Table of ContentsApplied used cash for financing activities in the amount of $1.8 billion for fiscal 2012. Applied generated $960 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2011, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.75 billion. Applied used cash for financing activities in the amount of $576 million for fiscal 2010. Financing activities for these periods included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012, $468 million in fiscal 2011, and $350 million in fiscal 2010. In March 2012, Applieds Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in March 2015. Proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were $97 million in fiscal 2012, $95 million in fiscal 2011, and $129 million in fiscal 2010.During fiscal 2012, Applieds Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.09 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.08 per share. During fiscal 2011, Applieds Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.08 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.07 per share. During fiscal 2010, Applieds Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.06. Cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $434 million, $397 million and $349 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applieds financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applieds stockholders.Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that was extended by one year in May 2012 and is scheduled to expire in May 2016. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 28, 2012. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $100 million are with Japanese banks. Applieds ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011 and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities.In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. At October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.In June 2011, Applied issued senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion. The following table summarizes the Notes issued in June 2011: Due DatePrincipal Amount Effective Interest Rate InterestPayment Dates (In millions) 2.650% Senior Notes Due 2016$400 2.666% June 15, December 154.300% Senior Notes Due 2021750 4.326% June 15, December 155.850% Senior Notes Due 2041600 5.879% June 15, December 15 $1,750 The indenture governing the Notes includes certain covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 28, 2012. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long term debt.Applieds investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.During fiscal 2012, Applied recorded a bad debt provision of $14 million as a result of certain customers financial condition. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at October 28, 2012 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.52Table of ContentsAs of October 28, 2012, approximately $800 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated for U.S. operations. Of this amount, Applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $450 million of these funds outside of the U.S. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. For the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, U.S. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applieds management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applieds liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applieds operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.For details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements below.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 28, 2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $42 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of October 28, 2012, Applied Materials Inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $102 million to cover these arrangements.Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rent expense was $38 million for fiscal 2012, $44 million for fiscal 2011, and $44 million for fiscal 2010.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes Applieds contractual obligations as of October 28, 2012: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal Less Than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More Than5 Years (In millions)Long term debt obligations$1,950 $ $ $600 $1,350Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations1,421 92 184 174 971Operating lease obligations89 31 32 18 8Purchase obligations*1,096 1,054 42 Other long term liabilities315 88 38 189 $4,871 $1,177 $346 $830 $2,518 *Represents Applieds agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applieds (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods.In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, Applied has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of October 28, 2012, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $174 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions were $7 million as of October 28, 2012 and $1 million as of October 30, 2011, which were classified as a long term liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, Applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.53Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applieds consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applieds financial condition or results of operations.Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applieds operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applieds consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applieds financial condition and results of operations.Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:Revenue RecognitionApplied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. Each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. In addition, Applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on Applieds financial condition and results of operations.Warranty CostsApplied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applieds warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applieds customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applieds estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsApplied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.54Table of ContentsInventory ValuationInventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsApplied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.Income TaxesThe effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that Applieds future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applieds expectations could have a material impact on Applieds results of operations and financial condition.Non GAAP ResultsManagement uses non GAAP results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the Companys business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this periods results with prior periods. The non GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain discrete tax items; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; certain acquisition related costs; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; and or gain or loss on sale of facilities. These non GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.55Table of ContentsThe following tables present a reconciliation of

certain expenses that are not absorbed by the segments, which are reported within corporate and unallocated costs and included in consolidated operating income.58Table of ContentsItem 7A:Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskApplied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances. Applieds investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.5 billion at October 28, 2012. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applieds investment portfolio at October 28, 2012, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $23 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary. At October 28, 2012, the carrying amount of debt issued by Applied was $1.9 billion with an estimated fair value of $2.3 billion. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Applieds debt issuances of approximately $221 million at October 28, 2012.Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2012.
