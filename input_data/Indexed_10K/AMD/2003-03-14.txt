ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2002, which are included in this annual report. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our investments, allowance for doubtful accounts, revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges, income taxes, commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates or the results of our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies relate to those policies that are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We hold minority interests in companies having operations or possessing technology primarily in areas within our strategic focus, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile stock prices. We also make investments in marketable equity and debt securities. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. In determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security or debt instrument is other than temporary, we evaluate the relevant market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples and other key measures providing an indication of the instruments fair value. For private equity investments, we evaluate the financial condition of the investee, market conditions, trends of earnings and other key factors that provide indicators of the fair value of the investment. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to interest income and other, net in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other accounts receivable due from customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the current business environment and our historical collection and write off experience. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened, additional allowances may be required in the future, resulting in additional charges to our operating results. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances and other known factors. Actual returns and allowances could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. 15 Table of Contents These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory, and are also used for near term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the assets carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs, facility exit costs, subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities. Inherent in these estimates are judgments about employee relation matters, whether employees might leave earlier than expected, complexities associated with abandoning and decommissioning facilities, the amount of sublease income we will receive, if any, and the time period necessary to sublease vacant facilities. We review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual cost may be different than our original or revised estimates. Deferred Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past performance, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at this time. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, which arise in the normal course of business. We are also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal governed cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business. We are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances, such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations In 2002, we operated in two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which reflects the aggregation of the PC processor, memory products and Other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment. Our Core Products segment includes our PC processor products, Memory products and Other IC products. PC processor products include our seventh generation microprocessors, the AMD Athlon and AMD Duron microprocessors. Memory products include Flash memory devices and Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) devices. Other IC products include platform products, which primarily consist of chipsets, embedded processors, networking products and personal connectivity solutions products. Our Foundry Services segment consists of fees from Legerity, Inc. and Vantis Corporation. In 2000, our Voice Communications segment consisted of our voice communications products subsidiary, Legerity. The following is a summary of net sales by segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 2001 2000 (Millions) Core Products segment: PC Processors $ 1,746 $ 2,419 $ 2,337 Memory Products 741 1,133 1,567 Other IC Products 176 242 457 2,663 3,794 4,361 Foundry Services segment 34 98 143 Voice Communications segment 140 Total $ 2,697 $ 3,892 $ 4,644 Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 Total net sales of $2,697 million decreased by 31 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. PC processors net sales of $1,746 million decreased by 28 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in both unit sales and average selling prices, reflecting industry wide weakness in PC sales. The decrease in unit sales also reflected the execution of our plan to align AMD PC Processor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand, reflecting our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. We expect PC processor sales in the first quarter of 2003 to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 based on sales of higher performance and higher priced products. Increasing PC processor sales levels in 2003 depends on our ability to maintain or increase average selling prices for our microprocessors, growth in unit shipments of our PC processors, our ability to introduce in a timely manner and market our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors and increasing market acceptance of the newest versions of the AMD Athlon processors. Memory products net sales of $741 million decreased by 35 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries. We expect memory products net sales in the first quarter of 2003 to remain flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Increasing memory products sales levels in 2003 depends on the degree of recovery of the telecommunications and networking equipment industries, continued growth in the mobile phone market, especially in high end mobile phones which require larger amounts of Flash memory, further penetration of the mobile phone market, and increased market acceptance of our MirrorBit Flash memory products. Other IC products net sales of $176 million decreased by 27 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products, embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. We expect 17 Table of Contents Other IC revenues in the first quarter of 2003 to continue to decline due to our decision to discontinue manufacturing certain of our embedded processor and networking products. Foundry Services segment service fees of $34 million decreased by 65 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. We expect that foundry services segment service fees will continue to decline in the first quarter of 2003 due to the termination of our foundry service arrangement with Legerity in the third quarter of 2002, and the termination of the foundry service arrangement with Vantis, which represented 18 percent of the total Foundry Services revenue in 2002, in the third quarter of 2003. Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Total net sales decreased by $752 million in 2001, or 16 percent, to $3,892 million from $4,644 million in 2000. PC processors net sales of $2,419 million increased by four percent in 2001 compared to 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our AMD Athlon and AMD Duron microprocessors, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. Memory products net sales of $1,133 million decreased by 28 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to continuing weakness in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by major customers. Other IC products net sales of $242 million decreased by 47 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products, embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. Foundry Services segment service fees of $98 million decreased by 31 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in demand for wafer fabrication services from Vantis, partially offset by an increase in overall service fees from Legerity. There were no sales from Voice Communications segment in 2001. Voice Communications products contributed $140 million to our 2000 net sales, prior to our sale of Legerity. Comparison of Expenses, Gross Margin Percentage, Interest and Other Income, Net and Interest Expense The following is a summary of expenses, gross margin percentage, and interest and other income, net and interest expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions except for gross margin percentage) Cost of sales $ 2,106 $ 2,590 $ 2,515 Gross margin percentage 22 % 33 % 46 % Research and development $ 816 $ 651 $ 642 Marketing, general and administrative 670 620 599 Restructuring and other special charges 331 89 Gain on sale of Legerity 337 Interest and other income, net 32 26 86 Interest expense 71 61 60 We operate in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid product development cycles and high fixed costs due to capital intensive manufacturing processes, particularly the costs to build and maintain state of the art production facilities required for PC processors and memory devices. As a result, our gross margin 18 Table of Contents percentage is significantly affected by new product production costs, product demand and our ability to sell PC processors and memory devices that we manufacture at sustainable average selling prices. Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of both PC processors and Flash memory devices as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 restructuring plan (discussed below) and the reallocation of certain manufacturing resources to research and development activities for new microprocessor products. Gross margin percentage decreased to 33 percent in 2001 compared to 46 percent in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of all our products caused by lower unit sales and average selling prices for Flash memory devices, networking products and embedded processors and lower average selling prices for PC processors. Research and development expenses of $816 million in 2002 increased 25 percent compared to 2001. This increase was primarily due to the reallocation of manufacturing resources, previously included in costs of goods sold, to research and development activities for new microprocessors. In addition, research and development expenses in 2002 included a $42 million charge for amounts paid to a third party in exchange for product development services provided in connection with a discrete PC processor research and development project in the fourth quarter of 2002. Research and development expenses and cost of sales in 2002 included the recognition of $21.8 and $37.5 million of deferred credits on foreign capital grants, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that were received from the State of Saxony for Fab 30. In 2001, these credits totaled $26.4 and $35.5 million. In 2000, these credits totaled $19.8 and $34.3 million. Research and development expenses of $651 million in 2001 increased slightly compared to 2000. This slight increase was due to increased costs related to research and development activities for PC processors. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $670 million in 2002 increased eight percent compared to 2001 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our AMD me branding campaign. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $620 million in 2001 increased four percent compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with our core products and the AMD Athlon XP processor launch, offset by the absence of Legerity expenses during 2001 as a result of its sale in 2000. In December 2002, we finalized a restructuring plan (the 2002 Plan) to align our cost structure to current industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. The 2002 Plan will result in the reduction of approximately 2,000 positions or 15 percent of our employees, affecting all levels of our workforce in almost every organization. As a result of our agreement with IBM, we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our SDC and will eliminate most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. The 2002 Plan will also result in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We are vacating, and attempting to sublease, certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases. We have also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment 19 Table of Contents charge of $32.5 million relating to a license associated with discontinued logic process development activities that has no future use, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million primarily to vacate and consolidate our facilities and $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. We began activities pursuant to the 2002 Plan during the fourth quarter of 2002, and expect to substantially complete the activities associated with the 2002 Plan by the end of June 2003. As of December 29, 2002, 929 employees were terminated pursuant to the 2002 Plan resulting in cash payments of $14 million in severance and employee benefit costs. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Plan through December 29, 2002: Severance and employee benefits Asset impairment Exit costs Other restructuring charges Total (Thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Q4 2002 non cash charges (118,590 ) (118,590 ) Q4 2002 cash charges (14,350 ) (795 ) (15,145 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 $ $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 As a result of the 2002 Plan, we expect to realize overall cost reductions of $350 million in 2003. In 2001, we announced a restructuring plan (the 2001 Plan) due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry, and a resulting decline in revenues. In connection with the plan, we closed Fabs 14 and 15 in Austin, Texas. These facilities supported certain of our older products and our Foundry Service operations, which have been discontinued as part of the plan. We also reorganized related manufacturing facilities and reduced activities primarily in Penang, Malaysia along with associated administrative support. Pursuant to the 2001 Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $89.3 million, consisting of $34.1 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, $13.0 million and $3.2 million of anticipated exit costs to close facilities in Austin and Asia, mostly in Penang, and $28.7 million and $10.3 million of non cash asset impairment charges in Austin and Asia, primarily Penang. The asset impairment charges related primarily to buildings and production equipment and have been incurred as a result of our decision to implement the plan. We substantially completed execution of the 2001 Plan by the end of 2002. As of December 29, 2002, 2,209 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2001 Plan resulting in cash payments of approximately $35.8 million for severance and employee benefit costs, of which $1.7 million was included in current year results of operations. 720 of these positions were associated with closing Fabs 14 and 15. The balance of the reductions resulted from reorganizing activities, primarily in Penang, Malaysia, along with associated administrative support. In addition, the planned facilities closures had been completed as of December 29, 2002 and related decommissioning costs will be incurred over the next six months. 20 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Plan through December 29, 2002: Severance and employee benefits Facility and equipment impairment Facility and equipment decommission costs Other facilities exit costs Total (Thousands) 2001 provision $ 34,105 $ 39,000 $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 89,305 Cash charges (7,483 ) (54 ) (7,537 ) Non cash charges (39,000 ) (39,000 ) Accrual at December 30, 2001 $ 26,622 $ $ 15,500 $ 646 $ 42,768 Cash Charges (26,622 ) (445 ) (27,067 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 $ $ $ 15,055 $ 646 $ 15,701 As a result of the 2001 Plan, we expect to realize overall cost reductions of $129 million on an annualized basis. The actions taken to date resulted in actual savings of $83 million in 2002. We sold 90 percent of Legerity to Francisco Partners, L.P. for approximately $375 million in cash, effective July 31, 2000. Prior to the sale, Legerity was a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD, selling voice communications products. Our pre tax gain on the sale of Legerity was $337 million. The gain was computed based on the excess of the consideration received for Legeritys net assets as of July 31, 2000, less direct expenses related to the sale. The applicable tax rate on the gain was 37 percent, resulting in an after tax gain of $212 million. Interest and other income, net, increased $6 million or 23 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to $4.7 million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to $27 million in charges in 2001 and a decrease of $20 million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower average cash balances. Interest expense increased 16 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to interest expense incurred on our $500 million 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022, issued at the end of January 2002, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of Fab 25 to a Flash memory facility and facilitization activities at Fab 30 and a decrease of interest expenses incurred on our Dresden term loans due to a partial repayment of the outstanding balance in 2002. Interest and other income, net, decreased $60 million or 70 percent in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to $27 million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments, a $14 million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in short term investments and a $9 million decrease due to the absence in 2001 of a gain on the sale of real property recorded in 2000. Interest expense increased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a decrease in capitalized interest expense attributable to the substantial completion of Fab 30 and increased borrowings by our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG (formerly known as AMD Saxony Manufacturing GmbH) (AMD Saxony), offset by the effect of redeeming our 6% convertible subordinated notes in May 2001. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $45 million in 2002, an income tax benefit of $14 million in 2001 and an income tax provision of $257 million in 2000. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions. No tax benefit was recorded in 2002 on pre tax losses due to the establishment in the fourth quarter of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses, as required under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The effective benefit rate of 15.4 percent for 2001 21 Table of Contents was less than the statutory rate because of a 24 percent tax benefit rate on the 2001 restructuring charges, reflecting the allocation of the charges between the U.S. and foreign low taxed jurisdictions, and a provision for U.S. taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of low taxed foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was 20.5 percent for 2000. The effective tax rate, excluding the gain on the sale of Legerity, was 14.5 percent, reflecting the benefit of realizing previously reserved deferred tax assets. The tax rate recorded in 2000 attributable to the gain on the sale of Legerity was 37 percent. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 72 percent in 2002, 66 percent in 2001 and 60 percent in 2000. During 2002, approximately one percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Comparison of Segment Income (Loss) In 2002, we operated in two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which reflects the aggregation of the PC processors, memory products and Other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment. The Core Products segment includes PC processors, Flash memory devices, EPROMs, embedded processors, platform products, personal connectivity solutions products and networking products. The Foundry Services segment included fees for products sold to Legerity and Vantis. Our previous Voice Communications segment included the voice communications products of our former subsidiary, Legerity. For a comparison of segment net sales, refer to the previous discussions on net sales by product group. The following is a summary of operating income (loss) by segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions) Core Products $ (846 ) $ 72 $ 832 Foundry Services (7 ) (34 ) 22 Voice Communications 35 Total $ (853 ) $ 38 $ 889 Core Products segment operating results decreased by $918 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in net sales. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in both average selling prices and unit sales for our core products due to the sustained downturn in the PC, telecommunications and networking equipment industries. The Foundry Services segment operating loss decreased by $27 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the cost savings realized from the closure of Fabs 14 and 15 pursuant to the 2001 Restructuring Plan. The Voice Communications segment operating income was zero in 2002 and 2001 due to our sale of Legerity, effective July 31, 2000. Financial Condition Net cash used in operating activities was $89 million in 2002 primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,303 million, offset by non cash charges, including $756 million of depreciation and amortization, $311 million of restructuring and other special charges, and other sources of cash of $163 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. 22 Table of Contents At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 30, 2001 despite the decrease in sales due to an increase of product to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of flash memory production from the conversion of Fab 25. Net cash provided by operating activities was $168 million in 2001 primarily as a result of our net loss of $61 million, adjusted for non cash charges, including $623 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $82 million of restructuring charges, $27 million of impairment charges on equity investments and $10 million of provision for doubtful accounts, offset by non cash credits of $98 million from net charges in deferred income taxes and foreign grant and subsidy income, and other uses of cash in operating activities of approximately $423 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,206 million in 2000 primarily due to net income of $983 million and depreciation and amortization of $579 million, offset by a nonrecurring $337 million reduction to operating cash flows from the gain on the sale of Legerity, a decrease of $267 million in other assets, an increase of $158 million from income tax benefits from employee stock option exercises, a decrease of $156 million in inventory, an increase of $175 million in payables and accrued liabilities, an increase of $143 million from customer deposits under long term purchase agreements, a decrease of $140 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $79 million in prepaid expenses and a decrease of $54 million from foreign grant and subsidy income. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002 including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase Alchemy Semiconductor, and $131 million from net purchases of available for sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $554 million in 2001 primarily due to $679 million used for the purchases of property, plant, and equipment, primarily for Fab 30 and Asia manufacturing facilities, and $122 million for additional equity investments in FASL, offset by $246 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $816 million in 2000 primarily due to $805 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by $375 million we received from the sale of Legerity and $398 million of net purchases of available for sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002 primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our $500 million 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our $402.5 million 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007, $108 million in proceeds from our September 2002 Term Loan Agreement, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million in borrowings under our Loan and Security Agreement dated July 13, 1999 (the July 1999 Loan Agreement), $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financing, $29 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with stock option exercises and employee purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and $76 million of net capital investment grants and interest subsidies received from the German government as part of the Fab 30 loan agreements. These amounts were offset by $325 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $232 million in 2001 primarily due to $63 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to banks, $308 million in proceeds from Dresden borrowing activities, $38 million in proceeds from the receipt of foreign grants and subsidies and $37 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in connection with stock option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by $137 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations and $77 million used to repurchase our common stock. 23 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities was $101 million in 2000 primarily due to $375 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, offset by $136 million in proceeds from borrowing activities, $123 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock and $15 million in proceeds from foreign grants and subsidies. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following tables summarize our principal contractual cash obligations and principal guarantees at December 29, 2002 and are supplemented by the discussion following the tables. Principal Contractual Cash Obligations at December 29, 2002 were: Total Payments due by period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and beyond (Thousands) Notes payable to banks $ 913 $ 913 $ $ $ $ $ Term Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 27, 2002 110,000 27,500 27,500 27,500 27,500 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 500,000 500,000 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 402,500 402,500 Dresden term loans 587,234 30,939 31,252 281,273 243,770 Capital lease obligations 44,546 18,381 16,897 5,970 3,298 Operating leases 376,730 54,162 48,580 43,550 38,265 20,787 171,386 Unconditional purchase commitments 160,411 50,351 49,960 49,670 2,726 2,568 5,136 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,182,334 $ 182,246 $ 174,189 $ 407,963 $ 315,559 $ 425,855 $ 676,522 Principal Guarantees at December 29, 2002 were: Maximum amounts guaranteed Amounts of guarantee expiration per period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and beyond (Thousands) Dresden intercompany guarantee $ 294,000 $ $ $ $ 294,000 $ $ BAC payment guarantee 26,044 26,044 AMTC payment guarantee 33,336 33,336 AMTC rental guarantee 131,000 131,000 FASL guarantee 208,000 208,000 Fujitsu guarantee 125,000 125,000 Total guarantee $ 817,380 $ 151,044 $ $ $ 294,000 $ 33,336 $ 339,000 Notes Payable to Banks We entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with a consortium of banks led by a domestic financial institution on July 13, 1999 (the July 1999 Loan Agreement). The July 1999 Loan Agreement provides for a four year secured revolving line of credit of up to $200 million. We can borrow, subject to amounts that may be set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. We must comply with certain financial covenants if the level of net domestic cash (as defined in the July 1999 Loan Agreement) we hold declines below $200 million or the 24 Table of Contents amount of borrowings under the July 1999 Loan Agreement rises to 50 percent of available credit. At December 29, 2002, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $718 million. The July 1999 Loan Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock if the level of our net domestic cash declines below $200 million. Our obligations under the July 1999 Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles and the related proceeds. As of December 29, 2002, there was no amount outstanding under the July 1999 Loan Agreement. As of December 29, 2002, we had approximately $18 million in lines of credit available to our foreign subsidiaries under other financing agreements, of which approximately $1 million was outstanding. September 2002 Loan Agreement On September 27, 2002, we entered into a term loan and security agreement with a domestic financial institution (the September 2002 Loan Agreement). Under the agreement, we can borrow up to $155 million to be secured by certain property, plant and equipment located at Fab 25. Amounts borrowed under the September 2002 Loan Agreement bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.8 percent at December 29, 2002. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 29, 2002, $110 million was outstanding under the September 2002 Loan Agreement. We must also comply with certain financial covenants if our net domestic cash balance (as defined in the September 2002 Loan Agreement) drops below $300 million. The September 2002 Term Loan Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock if the level of our net domestic cash declines below $300 million. At December 29, 2002, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $718 million. We intend to use the amounts borrowed under the September 2002 Loan Agreement for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022 On January 29, 2002, we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on each of August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5 year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures will also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are being amortized ratably, which approximates the interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures as interest expense. Beginning on February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at our option, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006 unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. 25 Table of Contents The redemption prices are as follows for the specified periods: Period Price Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375% Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583% Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792% Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000% We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our bonds with cash, stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries where we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of thirty trading days ending within 5 trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices are as follows for the specified periods: Period Price Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.8% Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.9% On December 1, 2007 100.0% The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are being amortized ratably, which approximates the interest method, over the term of the 4.50% Notes as interest expense. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Dresden Term Loans and Dresden Guarantee AMD Saxony, an indirect wholly owned German subsidiary of AMD, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the third quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.6 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 29, 2002, we had invested $2.1 billion in AMD Saxony. 26 Table of Contents In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. The Dresden Loan Agreements were amended in February 1998, June 1999, February 2001, June 2002 and December 2002. Because most of the amounts under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros), the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on January 1, 1999, of 1.95583 deutsche marks to 1 euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros, and then used exchange rate of 0.96 euro to 1 U.S. dollar as of December 29, 2002, to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into U.S. dollars. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of Fab 30. This funding consists of: equity contributions, subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from, and full cost reimbursement through, AMD; loans from a consortium of banks; and grants, subsidies and loan guarantees from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. The Dresden Loan Agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements, as of December 29, 2002, we had provided $156 million of subordinated loans, $315 million of revolving loans and $286 million of equity investments in AMD Saxony. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In addition to support from AMD, the consortium of banks referred to above made available up to $799 million in loans to AMD Saxony to help fund Fab 30 project costs. The loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid. AMD Saxony had $587 million of such loans outstanding as of December 29, 2002, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Please refer to the Contractual Cash Obligation table, above, for the repayment schedule, which was revised as part of the December 2002 amendments to the Dresden Loan Agreements. Finally, pursuant to a Subsidy Agreement, as amended in August 2002, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony are supporting the Fab 30 project, in accordance with the Dresden Loan Agreements, in the form of: guarantees equal to the lesser of 65 percent of AMD Saxony bank debt or $799 million; capital investment grants and allowances totaling $433 million; and interest subsidies totaling $160 million. Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $284 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $98 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony received advanced payments for interest subsidies amounting to $49 million, of which approximately $18 million is restricted from our access for more than one year, and is therefore included in Other Assets. In addition to the above mentioned subsidies, AMD Saxony also received $31 million in research and development subsidies through December 29, 2002. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. The historical rates were used to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars. 27 Table of Contents The Subsidy Agreement, as amended, imposes conditions on AMD Saxony, including the requirement to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated December 2003 employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan (see Note 14). Consequently, the anticipated headcount is below the level required to be maintained by the Subsidy Agreement. Based on these revised headcount estimates, the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement would be reduced from $433 million to $379 million. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. There have been no conditions of noncompliance through December 29, 2002 that would result in forfeiture of any of the grants and allowances. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, also require that we: provide interim funding to AMD Saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed, such funding to be repaid to AMD as AMD Saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the State of Saxony; fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the Subsidy Agreement caused by AMD Saxony or its affiliates; and guarantee up to 50 percent of AMD Saxonys obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which guarantee must not be less than $116 million or more than $313 million, until the bank loans are repaid in full. As of December 29, 2002, the amount outstanding under the guarantee was $294 million. As AMD Saxonys obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements, no incremental liability is recorded under the Dresden guarantee. AMD Saxony would be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements if we, AMD Saxony or AMD Saxony Holding GmbH (AMD Holding) fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events, including: material variances from the approved plan and specifications; our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the Dresden Loan Agreements; the sale of shares in AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; the failure to pay material obligations; the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; the occurrence of a default under the July 1999 Loan Agreement or the September 2002 Loan Agreement; and noncompliance with specified financial covenants. Generally, any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by AMD that results in recourse to us of more than $2.5 million, and that is not cured by us, would result in a cross default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, the July 1999 Loan Agreement and the September 2002 Loan Agreement. As of December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all conditions of the Dresden Loan Agreements. In the event we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, the July 1999 Loan Agreement and the September 2002 Loan Agreement, which would permit acceleration of certain indebtedness, which could have a 28 Table of Contents material adverse effect on us. The occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross default under the Indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 29, 2002, we had capital lease obligations of approximately $45 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2006. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. Operating Leases, Unconditional Purchase Commitments and Other Operating Commitments We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 29, 2002 were approximately $377 million, of which $137 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing supplies and services. Total purchase commitments as of December 29, 2002 were approximately $160 million for periods through 2009. FASL Facilities and Guarantees FASL, a joint venture formed by AMD and Fujitsu Limited in 1993, operates advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce Flash memory devices. FASL is continuing the facilitization of its second and third Flash memory device wafer fabrication facilities, FASL JV2 and FASL JV3. We expect FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, including equipment, to cost approximately $2.1 billion when fully equipped. As of December 29, 2002, approximately $1.6 billion of these costs had been funded by cash generated primarily from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL. These costs are incurred in Japanese yen and are, therefore, subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. On December 29, 2002, the exchange rate was 119.97 yen to one U.S. dollar. We use this rate to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. A significant portion of FASL capital expenditures in 2003 will continue to be funded by cash generated from FASL operations. However, to the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third party loans in proportion to our 49.992 percent interest in FASL, up to 25 billion yen ($208 million). As of December 29, 2002, we had $121 million in loan guarantees outstanding with respect to these third party loans. In 2000, FASL further expanded its production capacity through a foundry arrangement with Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. (FMI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu Limited. In connection with FMI equipping its wafer fabrication facility in Gresham, Oregon (the Gresham Facility) to produce flash memory devices for sale to FASL, we agreed to guarantee the repayment of up to $125 million of Fujitsus obligations as a co signer with FMI under its global multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with a third party bank (the Fujitsu Guarantee). On November 30, 2001, Fujitsu announced that it was closing the Gresham Facility, due to the downturn of the flash memory market. To date we have not received notice from Fujitsu that FMI has defaulted on any payments due under the Credit Facility. Fujitsu has requested that we pay the entire $125 million under the Fujitsu Guarantee. We continue to disagree with Fujitsu as to the amount, if any, of our obligations under the Fujitsu Guarantee. While we continue to discuss this matter with Fujitsu, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the Fujitsu Guarantee. 29 Table of Contents Advanced Mask Technology Center Guarantee and BAC Guarantee The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and Dupont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In June 2002, BAC entered into a $78 million bridge loan (Bridge Loan) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank for the purpose of constructing the facility. We guaranteed the payment obligations of BAC under the Bridge Loan, in an amount not to exceed $26 million plus interest and expenses. In December 2002, BAC and AMTC executed a facility agreement, consisting of a $125 million revolving credit facility (Revolving Loan) and a $78 million term loan facility (Term Loan), with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank. The Term Loan will supercede and replace the Bridge Loan. We guaranteed the payment obligations of AMTC, in an amount not to exceed $33 million plus interest and expenses, under the Revolving Loan. In addition, we guaranteed the payment obligations of BAC, in an amount not to exceed $26 million plus interest and expenses, under the Term Loan. In December 2002, the AMTC and BAC entered into a rental agreement with respect to the photomask facility. The rental agreement will become effective upon completion of construction of the photomask facility. We guaranteed approximately 23% of the payment obligations of AMTC under the rental agreement, which we believe will be equal to approximately $17 million, initially and diminish over time through 2011 as the Term Loan is repaid. Our rental guarantee replaces our guarantee of the Term Loan. In addition, in the event the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under its rental agreement, and the AMTC assumes the defaulting tenants lease and related lease obligations, we would be required to guarantee 23% of these additional rental payment obligations. Further, in the event one of the three joint venture partners is unable to meet its guarantee obligations with respect to AMTCs additional rental payment obligations, the remaining joint venture partners agreed to assume, on a pro rata basis, the defaulting partners guarantee obligations with respect to AMTCs additional rental payment only. Assuming the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under the rental agreement and AMTC exercises its option to assume the defaulting tenants obligations under its rental agreement, and assuming a default under the rental guarantee by both Infineon and Dupont, the maximum potential amount of our guarantee obligations for these rental payments would be approximately $131 million. As of December 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn under the Revolving Loan or the Term Loan and we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees. Other Financial Activities We plan to make capital investments of approximately $650 million during 2003, including amounts related to the continued facilitization of Fab 30 and Fab 25. We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with available external financing and the extension of existing facilities, will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments for at least the next 12 months. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the amortization and impairment provisions of SFAS 142 are effective upon the adoption of SFAS 142. We adopted SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 at the beginning of 2002. These accounting standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), which supersedes both Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, (SFAS 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (Opinion 30), for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). SFAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used. In addition, the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test, requires that a long lived asset or group of assets to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as held and used until they are disposed of, and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or group of assets as held for sale. SFAS 144 also retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). We adopted FAS 144 at the beginning of 2002, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) (EITF 94 3). The principal difference between SFAS 146 and EITF 94 3 relates to SFAS 146s timing for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for an exit cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94 3, a liability for an exit cost, as generally defined in EITF 94 3, was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We will adopt SFAS 146 prospectively as of December 30, 2002, the beginning of fiscal year 2003, and, therefore, its adoption is not expected to have any impact on our current financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements regarding its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The provisions related to the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The provisions related to recognition and measurement are applicable prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. As required, we have adopted the disclosure provisions in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2002. We are still in the process of assessing FIN 45s recognition and initial measurement requirements, and, at this point, do not believe the adoption of FIN 45 will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148), which provides for alternative methods to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock options in accordance with provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, In addition, SFAS 148 requires disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. We adopted the annual disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2002 and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The transition provisions of SFAS 148 are currently not applicable to us as we continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. 31 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. Currently, we do not have any variable interest entities, and we do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Risk Factors We have recently experienced substantial declines in revenues and increases in operating losses, and we may experience additional declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. Our total revenues for 2002 were $2,697 million compared to $3,892 million for 2001. This decline was due primarily to reduced demand for our products resulting from the current economic slowdown and our decision primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers, each as part of our efforts to reduce excess PC processor inventory in the overall supply chain. We incurred a net loss of $1.3 billion for 2002 compared to a net loss of $61 million for 2001. Reduced end user demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that, if we do, we will be able to sustain it. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a severe downturn, that is adversely affecting, and may continue to adversely affect, our business. The highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. The most recent downturn, which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 and continues today, has been severe and prolonged, and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged. Our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns, including the incurrence of substantial losses during the current downturn, as a result of: the cyclical nature of the supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; excess production capacity; and accelerated declines in average selling prices. If current conditions do not improve in the near term or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future, as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree, our business will continue to be adversely affected. Fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us. Our business is, and particularly our PC processor product lines are, tied to the personal computer industry. Industry wide fluctuations in the PC marketplace, including the current industry downturn that commenced in 2001 and has continued throughout 2002 have materially adversely affected us and may materially adversely affect us in the 32 Table of Contents future. If we continue to experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of PCs sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. In addition, current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry, as recently evidenced by the Hewlett Packard/Compaq merger, as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell Corporation, could further materially adversely affect us. We plan for significant capital expenditures in 2003 and beyond and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities, we may be materially adversely affected. We plan to continue to make significant capital expenditures to support our microprocessor and Flash memory products both in the near and long term, including approximately $650 million during 2003. These capital expenditures include those relating to the continued facilitization of Fab 30 and Fab 25. These capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will also decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, our July 1999 Loan Agreement is scheduled to expire in July 2003. Our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing would have a material adverse effect on us. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into the Dresden Loan Agreements and other related agreements. These agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. We currently estimate that the maximum construction and facilitization costs to us of Fab 30 will be $2.6 billion when fully equipped by the end of 2005. We had invested $2.1 billion as of December 29, 2002. If we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under these agreements, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which would permit acceleration of $587 million of indebtedness, as well as acceleration by cross default of our obligations under our other borrowing arrangements. Our joint venture with Fujitsu Limited, FASL, continues to facilitize its manufacturing facilities in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, known as FASL JV2 and FASL JV3. We expect FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, including equipment, to cost approximately $2.1 billion when fully equipped. As of December 29, 2002, approximately $1.6 billion of this cost had been funded. To the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of FASL JV2 and FASL JV3, we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third party loans in proportion to our 49.992 percent interest in FASL. We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations, and may incur additional debt, that could adversely affect our financial position. We have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future. At December 29, 2002, our total debt was $1.9 billion and stockholders equity was $2.5 billion. In addition, we had up to $200 million of availability under our July 1999 Loan Agreement (subject to our borrowing base). We had also guaranteed approximately $817 million of debt, and we are currently in disagreement as to the amount we owe, if any, under our additional guarantee to repay up to $125 million to Fujitsu in connection with a closed wafer fabrication facility in Gresham, Oregon. None of these guaranteed amounts are reflected as debt on our balance sheet. Our high degree of leverage may: limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; 33 Table of Contents limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and, to the extent of our outstanding debt under our September 2002 Loan Agreement, the impact of increases in interest rates. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties debts will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements or that we will be able to extend the July 1999 Loan Agreement. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us. The integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive. Products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, competitors enter the market and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. Failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce, on a cost effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins, would have a material adverse effect on us. Intel Corporations dominance of the PC processor market may limit our ability to compete effectively in that market. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in PCs for many years. As a result, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the market requires of Intels competitors. In addition, the financial strength of Intel allows it to market its product aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for us and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the Intel Inside brand program and other marketing programs. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by its: pricing and allocation strategies and actions; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers; and user brand loyalty. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the marketplace as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly expends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs and dealers, we depend on third party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and 34 Table of Contents other components. In recent years, many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, these companies produce chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other components to support each new generation of Intels microprocessors, and Intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron microprocessors will depend on our ability to ensure that PC platforms are designed to support our microprocessors. A failure of the designers and producers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings would have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to develop, produce and successfully market higher performing microprocessor products, we may be materially adversely affected. The microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever higher performance microprocessors. To compete successfully, we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes. If we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices, we could be materially adversely affected. To be successful, we must increase sales of our microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets, particularly the latter. Our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: our ability to continue offering new higher performance microprocessors competitive with Intels product offerings; our ability to introduce and create successful marketing positions for the upcoming AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, which rely in part on market acceptance and demand for 64 bit microprocessors based on x86 technology. our ability to maintain and improve the successful marketing position of the AMD Athlon XP microprocessor, which relies in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed (measured in megahertz frequency); our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive Intel pricing strategies, marketing programs, new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors, motherboards and chipsets; our ability, on a timely basis, to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in Fab 30 to 90 nanometer copper interconnect process; our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent; our ability to expand system design capabilities; and the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors. Our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the continuing success of our AMD Athlon microprocessors and the success of future generations of microprocessors, most immediately the AMD Opteron processor, and later this year the AMD Athlon 64 processor. If we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors, we may be materially adversely affected. We must introduce in a timely manner, and achieve market acceptance for, our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, or we will be materially adversely affected. We plan to ship our AMD Opteron 35 Table of Contents processors in April 2003 and our AMD Athlon 64 processors in September 2003. These processors are designed to provide high performance for both 32 bit and 64 bit applications in servers and in desktop and mobile PCs. The success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including our ability to produce them in a timely manner on new process technologies, including silicon on insulator technology, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; their market acceptance; the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for our eighth generation processors; and the support of the operating system and application program providers for our 64 bit instruction set. If we were to lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends on support from Microsoft in its operating systems. If Microsoft does not provide support in its operating systems for our x86 instruction sets, including our x86 64 technology that will be introduced with our AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron processors, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations. If we fail to retain the support and certification of Microsoft, our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected. The completion and impact of our restructuring program and cost reductions could adversely affect us. On November 7, 2002, we announced that we were formulating the 2002 Restructuring Plan to address the continuing industry wide weakness in the semiconductor industry by adjusting our cost structure to industry conditions. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we intend to reduce our fixed costs as a percentage of total costs over time from approximately 80 percent to approximately 70 percent. We also expect to reduce our expenses by approximately $100 million per quarter by the second quarter of 2003. As a result, we expect total expenses in 2003 to be reduced by approximately $350 million based on current product demand forecasts. We cannot, however, be sure that the goals of the 2002 Restructuring Plan will be realized. The ultimate effects of the 2002 Restructuring Plan could prove to be adverse. Weak market demand for our Flash memory products, the loss of a significant customer in the high end mobile telephone market, or any difficulty in our transition to Mirrorbit technology may have a material adverse effect on us. The demand for Flash memory devices has been weak due to the sustained downturn in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by our customers. In the third and fourth quarters of this year, our Flash memory product sales grew almost entirely based on strength in the high end mobile phone market. Our sales in that market are concentrated in a few customers. In addition, we expect competition in the market for Flash memory devices to continue to increase as competing manufacturers introduce new products and industry wide production capacity increases. We may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in Flash memory devices as the market develops and Intel and other competitors introduce new competing products. A decline in unit sales of our Flash memory devices, lower average selling prices, or a loss of a significant customer in the high end mobile phone market, would have a material adverse effect on us. In July 2002, we commenced production shipments of our first product with MirrorBit technology. Our MirrorBit technology is a new memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard Flash memory devices. A lack of customer acceptance, any substantial difficulty in transitioning our Flash memory products to MirrorBit technology or any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on our joint venture with Fujitsu, FASL, and if that joint venture is terminated or amended significantly, we could be materially adversely affected. We continue to rely on our joint venture with Fujitsu, FASL, to manufacture our Flash memory devices. In addition, beginning in 2002, Fab 25 began operating as a foundry to FASL and as of year end, Fab 25 was devoted entirely to Flash memory device production for FASL. While the FASL joint venture has been successful to date, there can be no assurance that we and Fujitsu will elect to continue the joint venture in its current form, in some other form or at all, which could have a material adverse affect on us. 36 Table of Contents Our memory products are based on the NOR architecture and a significant market shift to the NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Our memory products are based on the NOR architecture, and any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on the NAND architecture will reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share, which could have a materially adverse affect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers. The economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide, exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action, has adversely affected demand for our microprocessors, Flash memory devices and other integrated circuits. A continued decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a significant decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If the economic slowdown continues or worsens as a result of terrorist activities, military action or otherwise, it could adversely impact our customers ability to pay us in a timely manner. Manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. At times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by making significant capital investments in Fab 30, Fab 25, FASL JV3 and our test and assembly facility in Suzhou, China. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities, and we could be materially adversely affected. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. There may also be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, during periods when we are implementing new process technologies, our manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions in Fab 30 to smaller than 130 nanometer process technologies employing silicon on insulator technology could have a material adverse effect on us. At this time, the most significant risk is underutilization of our manufacturing capacity. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. From time to time, we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities, transferring production to other facilities, and in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We cannot be sure that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, transferring production to other facilities, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development of process technologies in an effort 37 Table of Contents to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products. For example, the successful development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology is critical to our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably. Further, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our July 1999 Loan Agreement and our September 2002 Loan Agreement contain restrictive covenants and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts, and the Dresden Loan Agreements imposes restrictive covenants on AMD Saxony, including a prohibition on its ability to pay dividends. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our July 1999 Loan Agreement, our September 2002 Loan Agreement and or the Dresden Loan Agreements. The occurrence of an event of default under any of these agreements or under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes would likely result in a cross default under the agreements covering the other borrowings and would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the July 1999 Loan Agreement, the September 2002 Loan Agreement and the Dresden Loan Agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our personal property, including inventory and accounts receivable, as security under our July 1999 Loan Agreement, and certain property, plant and equipment as security under our September 2002 Loan Agreement, and AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the noteholders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we might have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Singapore; or by subcontractors in the United States 38 Table of Contents and Asia. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers and joint ventures for the manufacture of a portion of our finished silicon wafers and have international sales operations. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets. Expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above, and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets. Our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be otherwise adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year. This seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in Europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the PC market during the winter holiday season. In recent quarters, a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory. During 2002, the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a decline in end user demand which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and resulted in high levels of inventories in the PC industry supply chain. In some cases, this led to delays in payments for our products. We believe that these and other factors could continue to materially adversely affect our revenues in the near term. Our price protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most 39 Table of Contents instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued. These agreements, which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice, generally allow for the return of our products. The price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Further, patent applications that we file may not be issued. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to cost effectively monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms, if at all. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Failure to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, cessation of operations or sales, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, DC on September 11, 2001, and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales. Also as a result of terrorism, the United States may be included in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain, and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or exacerbate economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results, revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities. Our corporate headquarters, assembly and research and development activities are located in an earthquake zone and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake. Our corporate 40 Table of Contents headquarters, assembly operations in California and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 29, 2002, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and they consisted primarily of money market funds, short term corporate notes, short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries, on liabilities for products purchased from FASL and AMD Saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed asset purchase commitments. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We had an aggregate of $492 million (notional amount) of short term foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts denominated in Japanese yen, European Union euro and Singapore dollar outstanding as of December 29, 2002. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 29, 2002 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. 42 Table of Contents The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001.
