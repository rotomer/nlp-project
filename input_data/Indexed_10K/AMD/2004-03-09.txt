ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2003, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market industry standard digital integrated circuits that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations and servers, communications equipment, and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products include microprocessors, Flash memory devices, and Personal Connectivity Solutions products. The semiconductor industry has recently shown signs of recovery from the downturn experienced during 2001 and 2002, which contributed to an improvement in our operating results during 2003 compared to 2002. Total net sales for 2003 of $3,519 million increased 30 percent compared with net sales of $2,697 million for 2002. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the consolidation of FASL LLCs results of operations, which include sales by FASL LLC to Fujitsu. In addition, the restructuring and cost cutting measures that we initiated in 2002 contributed to significant cost savings in 2003. These cost savings, combined with the increase in revenues, contributed to a 79 percent decrease in net loss from a net loss of $1,303 million in 2002 to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. During 2003, we reached an agreement with Fujitsu to form FASL LLC. The formation of FASL LLC has allowed us to combine our and Fujitsus product manufacturing and technology development efforts to respond more quickly to the demands of our Flash memory product customers. As a result of the transaction, we began consolidating FASL LLCs results of operations on June 30, 2003. However, as FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of FASL LLCs operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for our Memory Products segment for the year ended December 28, 2003, is not fully comparable to the segment information for all prior periods presented. In addition, we introduced our 64 bit microprocessor products during 2003 with the launch of our AMD Opteron processor for servers and workstations in April and our AMD Athlon 64 processor for desktop and mobile PCs in September. In November 2003, we began construction of a new 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our 64 bit microprocessors. In addition to providing increased capacity, we believe that manufacturing our 64 bit processors on 300 millimeter silicon wafers, and employing advanced manufacturing process technologies, will allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs. For 2004, we believe critical success factors include: increasing market acceptance of 64 bit computing; our and FASL LLCs ability to successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; our ability to develop and introduce new products for the server and workstation markets on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; expanding our participation in emerging global markets, including China, Latin America, India, and Eastern Europe; improving our share of the Flash memory market, including enabling the increased adoption of MirrorBit technology; and maximizing the synergies of FASL LLC. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with managements expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on management judgment while considering actual historical sales returns, historical price reductions, market activity, allowances, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. Actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. We adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the assets carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs, facility exit 21 Table of Contents costs, subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities. We review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates. These changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges, net, line of our consolidated operating statements. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time. In fiscal 2003, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision (benefit) line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. We are also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business. We are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances, such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made. Results Of Operations As discussed above in the section entitled, Developments in 2003, on page 1, effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu formed FASL LLC. As a result of the transaction, we began consolidating FASL LLCs results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of the Manufacturing Joint Ventures operating results under the equity method. As FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of 2003 do not include the consolidation of FASL LLCs results of operations. Accordingly, our operating results for the year ended December 28, 2003 are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods. As we have a 60 percent controlling interest in FASL LLC, Fujitsus 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of FASL LLC is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements. This minority interest adjustment will not correspond to Memory Products segment operating income (loss) because Memory Products segment operating income (loss) includes operations incremental to those of FASL LLC. In addition, the minority interest calculation is based on FASL LLCs net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). 22 Table of Contents We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products and Foundry Services segments. Primarily as a result of the formation of FASL LLC, we re evaluated our reportable segments. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, we changed our reportable segments to: the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products, and the Memory Products segment, which includes Flash memory products. We believe that separate reporting of these operating segments, given our new focus on FASL LLC as a separate operating company and its separate market brand Spansion, provides more useful information to our stockholders. In addition to our reportable segments, we also have the All Other category that is not a reportable segment, but rather it includes other small operating segments that are neither individually nor in the aggregate greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues or assets. This category also includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. However, as FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of FASL LLCs operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 28, 2003, is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for all prior periods presented. We use a 52 to 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002, and December 30, 2001, each included 52 weeks. The following is a summary of our net sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Computation Products $ 1,960 $ 1,756 $ 2,466 Memory Products 1,419 741 1,133 All Other 140 200 293 Total $ 3,519 $ 2,697 $ 3,892 Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 Total net sales of $3,519 million in 2003 increased 30 percent compared to net sales of $2,697 million in 2002. Computation Products net sales of $1,960 million in 2003 increased 12 percent compared to net sales of $1,756 million in 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to a 15 percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our OEM customers, partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices of our microprocessor products. Unit shipment growth was particularly strong in Latin America and China, which accounted for 77 percent of overall unit growth. Memory Products net sales of $1,419 million in 2003 increased 92 percent compared to net sales of $741 million in 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the effect of consolidating FASL LLCs results of operations, which include FASL LLCs sales to Fujitsu, and increased demand for Flash memory products. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. All Other net sales of $140 million in 2003 decreased 30 percent compared to net sales of $200 million in 2002 and consisted primarily of net sales of our Personal Connectivity Solutions products. The decrease was due 23 Table of Contents to a $53 million decrease in revenue resulting from discontinued production of selected mature embedded processors and networking products and a $34 million decrease in Foundry Services revenue, offset by a $28 million increase in revenues from sales of AMD Geode and wireless products. Net Sales Comparison for Years Ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 Total net sales of $2,697 million in 2002 decreased 31 percent compared to net sales of $3,892 million in 2001. Computation Products net sales of $1,756 million in 2002 decreased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2,466 million in 2001. This decrease was almost wholly due to a decrease in unit sales of 16 percent, and a decrease in average selling prices of 13 percent, reflecting industry wide weakness in PC sales, competitive pricing pressure, and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand, which included our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. Memory Products net sales of $741 million in 2002 decreased 35 percent compared to net sales of $1,133 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of 36 percent, reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries. All Other net sales of $200 million in 2002 decreased 32 percent compared to net sales of $293 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Foundry Services revenues of approximately $64 million and a decrease in net sales of $31 million from embedded processors and networking products as a result of sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries. Comparison of Gross Margin Percentage, Expenses, Interest Income and Other, Net, and Interest Expense The following is a summary of gross margin percentage, expenses and interest income and other, net, and interest expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions except for gross margin percentage) Cost of sales $ 2,327 $ 2,106 $ 2,590 Gross margin percentage 34 % 22 % 33 % Research and development 852 816 651 Marketing, general and administrative 587 670 620 Restructuring and other special charges, net (14 ) 331 89 Interest income and other, net 21 32 26 Interest expense 110 71 61 Income tax provision (benefit) 3 45 (14 ) Gross margin percentage increased to 34 percent in 2003 compared to 22 percent in 2002. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 30 percent, accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent. Our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, microprocessor unit sales increased 15 percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent, and we realized $63 million, or approximately two percentage points resulting from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of FASL LLCs operating results on June 30, 2003. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The 24 Table of Contents amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credits to cost of sales totaled $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002. Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 31 percent decrease in the combined sales of PC processors and Flash memory products, as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices due to weakened customer demand and industry wide excess inventory, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 Restructuring Plan, which is discussed below. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002 due primarily to an increase in expenses as a result of the FASL LLC transaction, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million in expenses related to amounts paid to IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high performance microprocessor products. These increases were offset by a $35 million reduction in internal research and development costs from 2002 to 2003, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as credits to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credits to research and development expenses totaled $29.0 million in 2003 and $21.8 million in 2002. Research and development expenses of $816 million in 2002 increased 25 percent compared to $651 million in 2001. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in research and development efforts directed to our microprocessors. In addition, research and development expenses in 2002 included a $42 million charge for amounts paid to IBM in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes in the fourth quarter of 2002, as well as the reallocation of $30 million from manufacturing resources, previously included in costs of goods sold, to research and development activities for microprocessors. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $587 million in 2003 decreased 12 percent compared to $670 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $55 million and cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $670 million in 2002 increased eight percent compared to $620 million in 2001 primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our branding campaign. In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. As part of this plan, and as a result of our agreement with IBM to jointly develop future generations of our logic process technology, we ceased logic research and development in the SDC and eliminated most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities 25 Table of Contents currently occupied under long term operating leases through 2013. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment charge of $32.5 million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued logic development activities, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. During 2003, management approved the sale of additional equipment, primarily equipment used in the SDC, that was identified as no longer useful in our operations. As a result, we recorded approximately $11 million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2003, including $3.3 million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment. During 2003, we revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan from 2,000 to 1,800 in response to the additional resources required due to the FASL LLC transaction. As a result, we reversed $8.9 million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual. As of December 28, 2003, 1,736 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of $53 million in severance and employee benefit costs. The remaining accrual of $6.7 million represents the severance benefits cost obligations for individuals whose employments terminated but who elected to defer receipt of severance benefits until 2004 and for employees who were pre notified in 2003 of their employment terminations, which will occur in 2004. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities, net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have substantially completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan as of December 28, 2003. As a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we realized overall cost reductions of approximately $150 million in 2003. We also implemented other cost reduction initiatives incremental to the specific expense reductions resulting from the 2002 Restructuring Plan. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 28, 2003: Severanceand employeebenefits Assetimpairment Exit costs Otherrestructuringcharges Total (Thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Non cash charges (118,590 ) (118,590 ) Cash charges (14,350 ) (795 ) (15,145 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 54,420 138,105 4,315 196,840 2003 Provision 7,791 3,314 11,105 Cash charges (38,816 ) (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non cash charges (7,791 ) (7,791 ) Non cash adjustment (8,864 ) (15 ) (8,879 ) Accrual at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 $ $ 120,623 $ $ 127,363 In 2001, we announced a restructuring plan (the 2001 Restructuring Plan) due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues. We substantially completed our execution of the 26 Table of Contents 2001 Restructuring Plan as of December 28, 2003. During 2003, we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by $12.2 million based on the most current information available. During 2003, we also realized a recovery of approximately $3.9 million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that was determined to be impaired as a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan. Both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges, net. As a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan, we have realized overall cost reductions of $211 million as of December 28, 2003. The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Restructuring Plan through December 28, 2003: Severanceand employeebenefits Facility andequipmentimpairment Facilities andequipmentdecommissioncosts Otherfacilitiesexit costs Total (Thousands) 2001 provision $ 34,105 $ 39,000 $ 15,500 $ 700 $ 89,305 2001 cash charges (7,483 ) (54 ) (7,537 ) 2001 non cash charges (39,000 ) (39,000 ) Accrual at December 30, 2001 26,622 15,500 646 42,768 2002 cash charges (26,622 ) (445 ) (27,067 ) Accrual at December 29, 2002 15,055 646 15,701 Non cash adjustments (11,574 ) (646 ) (12,220 ) Cash charges (2,485 ) (2,485 ) Accrual at December 28, 2003 $ $ $ 996 $ $ 996 Interest income and other, net, of approximately $21 million in 2003 decreased 34 percent from $32 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of $16 million caused by lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances and $2.3 million in charges in 2003 for other than temporary declines in our equity investments. This decrease was offset by a gain of approximately $6 million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to FASL LLC. Fujitsu now owns a 40 percent interest in these assets. The gain on the deemed sale of these assets to FASL LLC was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction. Interest income and other, net, of $32 million increased $6 million or 23 percent in 2002 compared to $26 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to $4.7 million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to $27 million in charges in 2001, offset by a decrease of $20 million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest expense of $110 million in 2003 increased 55 percent compared to $71 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the effect of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (4.50% Notes), issued in November 2002, which resulted in annual interest charges of $18 million, interest of $5 million on $110 million drawn at the end of September 2002 under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, and the FASL LLC transaction, which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $9 million in 2003. In addition, in 2002 we capitalized interest of $10.7 million on continued expansion and facilitization of Fabs 25 and 30 compared to only $1.5 million in 2003. Interest expense of $71 million in 2002 increased 16 percent compared to $61 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effect of interest expense incurred on our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (4.75% Debentures), issued in January 2002, which resulted in interest charges of $22 million, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of Fab 25 to a Flash memory facility, facilitization activities at Fab 30, and a decrease of $11 million in interest expense due to a partial repayment of the outstanding loans under the Dresden Loan Agreements in 2002. 27 Table of Contents We recorded an income tax provision of $3 million in 2003, an income tax provision of $45 million in 2002 and an income tax benefit of $14 million in 2001. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. No net tax benefit was recorded in 2003 on pre tax losses due to continuing operating losses. Our tax provision for 2003 does not reflect an increase in our net deferred tax liability of approximately $46 million. This net deferred tax liability was recognized by the Japanese subsidiary of FASL LLC, FASL JAPAN, as tax expense in periods prior to our consolidation of FASL LLC on June 30, 2003, and therefore has not been recorded as a component of our tax expense for 2003. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions. No tax benefit was recorded in 2002 on pre tax losses due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter, due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses in the U.S. The effective benefit rate of 15.4 percent for 2001 was less than the statutory rate because of a lower than U.S. statutory 24 percent tax benefit rate on the 2001 restructuring charges, reflecting the allocation of the charges between the U.S. and foreign lower taxed jurisdictions, and a provision for U.S. taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of lower taxed foreign subsidiaries. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 80 percent in 2003, compared to 73 percent in 2002 and 67 percent in 2001. During 2003, approximately 15 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, as compared to one percent during 2002. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of FASL LLCs results of operations, which include sales by FASL LLC to Fujitsu, which are denominated in yen. Our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen denominated manufacturing costs. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in Fab 30, which are denominated in euros. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro, but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our Fab 30 manufacturing costs. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Comparison of Operating Income (Loss) The following is a summary of operating income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Computation Products $ (23 ) $ (661 ) $ (191 ) Memory Products (189 ) (159 ) 268 All Other (21 ) (405 ) (135 ) Total $ (233 ) $ (1,225 ) $ (58 ) Computation Products operating loss of $23 million in 2003 improved by $638 million compared to $661 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to incremental net sales of $204 million and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of $330 million and marketing, general and administrative expenses of $39 million, which resulted primarily from our cost reduction initiatives and the 2002 Restructuring Plan. In addition, cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $55 million from 2002. Computation Products operating loss of $661 million in 2002 increased by $470 million compared to $191 million in 2001 primarily due to a decrease in net sales. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in average selling prices of 13 percent and a decline in unit sales of 16 percent for microprocessors as a result of the sustained downturn in the PC industry. 28 Table of Contents Memory Products operating loss of $189 million in 2003 increased $30 million from 2002. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of FASL LLC on June 30, 2003. Memory Products operating loss was $159 million in 2002 compared to $268 million of operating income in 2001. The change in the operating result was primarily due to decrease in net sales of $392 million as a result of a 36 percent decline in average selling prices due to continued weakness in the Flash memory market. Our All Other operating loss of $21 million in 2003 improved by $384 million compared to 2002, primarily due to $331 million of restructuring and other special charges included in the 2002 results, and a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in 2003. Our All Other operating loss of $405 million in 2002 increased by $270 million compared to 2001. The operating loss included $331 million of restructuring and other special charges in 2002 compared to approximately $89 million in 2001. The remaining increase of operating loss was primarily due to an increase in operating loss of Personal Connectivity Solutions products, partially offset by approximately $27 million of improvement of operating results in Foundry Services. Financial Condition Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 28, 2003 totaled $1.1 billion, which included approximately $330 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments maintained by FASL LLC. FASL LLCs operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash balance for operations or to distribute it to us and Fujitsu. Pursuant to the operating agreement, and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements, FASL LLC must first distribute any cash balance to us and Fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each partys estimated tax liability, if any, related to FASL LLCs taxable income for each fiscal year. Any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by FASL LLC to fund its operations in accordance with its budget. If any cash remains, it must be used to repay FASL LLCs outstanding debt to us and Fujitsu. Any remaining cash after such distributions is distributed at the discretion of FASL LLCs Board of Managers, to us and Fujitsu, pro rata, based on each partys membership interest at the time of distribution, which currently is 60 percent and 40 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of FASL LLCs results of operations, which include FASL LLCs sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of FASL LLCs results of operations. At December 28, 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated net accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated net sales. The net changes in payables and accrued liabilities included payments in 2003 of $90 million for a technology license from IBM, approximately $64 million of payments in 2003 under the 2002 Restructuring Plan and an accrual of $29 million in December 2003 related to our license from IBM for technology and know how related to manufacturing products on 300 millimeter silicon wafers. Net cash used in operating activities was $120 million in 2002, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,303 million, adjusted by non cash related charges. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2002 as compared to 2001 were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a 31 percent decrease in net sales. At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 29, 2001 due to an increase of products to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of Flash memory production from Fab 25 following its conversion from logic manufacturing. 29 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $168 million in 2001. Although we had a net loss of $61 million, adjustments for non cash charges resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. These adjustments included: $623 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $82 million of restructuring charges, $27 million of impairment charges on equity investments and $10 million of provision for doubtful accounts, offset by non cash credits of $98 million from net charges in deferred income taxes and foreign grant and subsidy income, and other uses of cash in operating activities of approximately $423 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash inflow of $482 million from sales and purchases of available for sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired from the FASL LLC transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002, including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Alchemy Semiconductor, Inc., and $131 million from net purchases of available for sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $554 million in 2001, primarily due to $679 million used for the purchases of property, plant, and equipment, primarily for Fab 30 and our assembly and test facilities in Asia, and $122 million for additional equity investments in the Manufacturing Joint Venture, offset by $246 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by FASL LLC, a $40 million cash note to FASL LLC from Fujitsu as part of the FASL LLC transaction, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany as part of the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in a compensating cash balance. The compensating cash balance represents the minimum cash balance that must be maintained by AMD Saxony in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Dresden Loan Agreements. Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002, primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our 4.75% Debentures, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from issuing our 4.50% Notes, $108 million drawn pursuant to the September 2002 Term Loan Agreement (currently referred to as the July 2003 FASL Term Loan), net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million drawn pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement dated July 13, 1999 (currently referred to as the July 2003 Loan Agreement), $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financing, $29 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, and $76 million of net capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony as part of the Fab 30 project. These amounts were offset by $325 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $141 million in 2001, primarily due to $63 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to banks, $308 million drawn pursuant to the Dresden Loan Agreements, $38 million in capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony as part of the Fab 30 project, and $37 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee stock option exercises, offset by $137 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, $77 million used to repurchase our common stock and a $91 million increase in the compensating cash balance discussed above. 30 Table of Contents Notes Payable to Banks On July 7, 2003, we amended and restated our 1999 Loan and Security Agreement with a consortium of banks led by a domestic financial institution (the July 2003 Loan Agreement). We further amended the July 2003 Loan Agreement on October 3, 2003. The July 2003 Loan Agreement currently provides for a secured revolving line of credit of up to $125 million that expires in July 2007. We can borrow, subject to amounts set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. As of December 28, 2003, no amount was outstanding under the July 2003 Loan Agreement. We have to comply, among other things, with the following financial covenants if our net domestic cash (as defined in the July 2003 Loan Agreement) declines below $125 million: restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock; maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 Loan Agreement) as follows: Measurement Date Amount December 31, 2003 $1.25 billion Last day of each calendar quarter in 2004 $1.425 billion Last day of each calendar quarter in 2005 $1.85 billion March 31, 2006 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $2.0 billion achieve EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) according to the following schedule: Period Amount Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2003 $400 million Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2004 $550 million Four fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2004 $750 million Four fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2004 $850 million Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2004 $950 million Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2005 and on each fiscal quarter thereafter $1,050 million As of December 28, 2003, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $567 million and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Our obligations under the July 2003 Loan Agreement are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding FASL LLCs accounts receivable, inventory, and general intangibles. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following tables summarize our principal contractual cash obligations that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and principal guarantees of such indebtedness at December 28, 2003, and are supplemented by the discussion following the tables. 31 Table of Contents Principal contractual cash obligations that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 28, 2003 were: Payments due by period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andbeyond (Thousands) 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 500,000 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 402,500 402,500 Dresden Term Loan 664,056 37,307 335,759 290,990 July 2003 FASL Term Loan 72,500 27,500 27,500 17,500 FASL JAPAN Term Loan 167,926 44,780 44,780 44,780 33,586 Fujitsu cash note 40,000 10,000 30,000 Capital lease obligations 245,958 83,680 84,022 74,228 3,899 129 Other long term liabilities 116,091 33,911 15,262 15,555 16,123 35,240 Total Principal Contractual Cash Obligations $ 2,209,031 $ 193,267 $ 535,972 $ 472,760 $ 455,540 $ 16,252 $ 535,240 Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 28, 2003 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2003 and their expected expiration dates by year: Amounts of guarantee expiration per period AmountsGuaranteed* 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andBeyond (Thousands) Dresden intercompany guarantee $ 332,028 $ 18,653 $ 167,880 $ 145,495 $ $ $ July 2003 FASL Term Loan guarantee 43,500 16,500 16,500 10,500 FASL JAPAN Term Loan guarantee 100,756 26,868 26,868 26,868 20,152 FASL capital lease guarantees 147,303 53,655 49,494 40,422 3,732 Total guarantees $ 623,587 $ 115,676 $ 260,742 $ 223,285 $ 23,884 $ $ * Represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002, we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate per annum equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5 year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any 32 Table of Contents time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. Beginning on February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at our option, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006, unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price aspercentage ofprincipal amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our bonds with cash, stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price aspercentage ofprincipal amount Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.8 % Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.9 % On December 1, 2007 100.0 % The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are amortized ratably, over the term of the 4.50% Notes, as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. 33 Table of Contents Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Dresden Term Loan and Dresden Term Loan Guarantee AMD Saxony, our indirect, wholly owned German subsidiary, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the second quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.5 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 28, 2003, we had invested $2.3 billion in AMD Saxony and we currently estimate that during 2004 we will invest approximately $160 million. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. The Dresden Loan Agreements were amended in February 2004 to accommodate the construction, facilitization, and operation of Fab 36. Because most of the amounts under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros), the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on January 1, 1999, of 1.95583 deutsche marks to one euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros, and then used exchange rate as of December 28, 2003, of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into U.S. dollars. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of Fab 30. The funding consists of: equity contributions, subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from, and full cost reimbursement through, AMD; loans from a consortium of banks; and investment grants, investment allowances, interest subsidies, and loan guarantees from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. The Dresden Loan Agreements require that we partially fund Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to, or equity investments in, AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements, as of December 28, 2003 we had provided $179 million of subordinated loans and $286 million of equity investments in AMD Saxony. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In addition to support from us, the consortium of banks referred to above made available $954 million in loans to AMD Saxony to help fund Fab 30 project costs. The loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid. AMD Saxony had $664 million of such loans outstanding as of December 28, 2003, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Finally, pursuant to a Subsidy Agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony are supporting the Fab 30 project, in accordance with the Dresden Loan Agreements, in the form of: guarantees equal to 65 percent of AMD Saxony bank debt, or $432 million; capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $453 million; and interest subsidies totaling $191 million. 34 Table of Contents Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $412 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $131 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony has received advance payments for interest subsidies amounting to $22 million as of December 28, 2003. AMD Saxony also received $55 million in research and development subsidies through December 28, 2003. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. Historical exchange rates in effect at the time these investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies were received were used to translate amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars. Under the Subsidy Agreement, for the construction and financing of Fab 30, AMD Saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Consequently, as of December 2003, headcount was below the level agreed to by AMD Saxony at which AMD Saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available. However, the aggregate amount of grants and allowances actually received by AMD Saxony to date, calculated as a percentage of the maximum amount of grants and allowances available, does not exceed the actual headcount at AMD Saxony at December 2003, calculated as a percentage of the headcount target undertaken in the Subsidy Agreement. Accordingly, AMD Saxony does not believe it has received grants and allowances in excess of its entitlement under the Subsidy Agreement. However, we anticipate that the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement will be reduced from an originally anticipated amount of $517 million to approximately $453 million. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. The Dresden Loan Agreements, as amended, also require that we: provide interim funding to AMD Saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed, such funding to be repaid to AMD, as AMD Saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany; fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the Subsidy Agreement caused by AMD Saxony or its affiliates; and guarantee of up to 50 percent of AMD Saxonys obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which guarantee must not be less than $138 million or more than $373 million, until the bank loans are repaid in full. As of December 28, 2003, the amount outstanding under the guarantee was $332 million. As AMD Saxonys obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements, no incremental liability is recorded under the Dresden guarantee. AMD Saxony would be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements if we, AMD Saxony or AMD Saxony Holding GmbH (AMD Holding) fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the Dresden Loan Agreements; the sale of shares in AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; the failure to pay material obligations; 35 Table of Contents the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Saxony or AMD Holding; the occurrence of a default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement; and AMD Saxonys noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, asset cover ratio and a minimum liquidity covenant. Generally, any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by AMD that results in recourse to us of more than $2.5 million, and that is not cured by us, would result in a cross default under the Dresden Loan Agreements. As of December 28, 2003, we were in compliance with all conditions of the Dresden Loan Agreements. In the event we are unable to meet our obligations to AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements and the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is materially adversely affected, we will be in default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, which would permit acceleration of the outstanding loans of approximately $664 million. The occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross default under the Indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. We cannot assure that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. July 2003 FASL Term Loan and Guarantee On July 11, 2003, we amended our September 2002 Loan Agreement and assigned it to FASL LLC. Under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (the July 2003 FASL Term Loan), amounts borrowed bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.14 percent at December 28, 2003. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 28, 2003, $72.5 million was outstanding under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan, of which 60 percent is guaranteed by us and 40 percent is guaranteed by Fujitsu. FASL LLC has granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan. The July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement restricts FASL LLCs ability to pay cash dividends in respect of membership interests if FASL LLCs net domestic cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) declines below $130 million through the first quarter of 2004, $120 million from the second quarter of 2004 to the end of 2005 and $100 million during 2006. FASL LLC must also comply with additional financial covenants if its net domestic cash balance declines below $130 million through the first quarter of 2004, $120 million from the second quarter of 2004 to the end of 2005 and $100 million during 2006. At any time that net domestic cash falls below these thresholds, FASL LLC must comply with, among other things, the following financial covenants: maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) of not less than $850 million; achieve EBITDA according to the following schedule: Period Amount For the six months ending December 2003 $75 million For the nine months ending March 2004 $170 million For the four quarters ending June 2004 $285 million For the four quarters ending September 2004 $475 million For the four quarters ending December 2004 $550 million For the four quarters ending in 2005 $640 million For the four quarters ending in 2006 $800 million 36 Table of Contents maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the July 2003 FASL Term Loan) according to the following schedule: Period Ratio Fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 0.2 to 1.00 First fiscal quarter of 2004 0.25 to 1.00 Period ending June 2004 0.4 to 1.00 Period ending September 2004 0.8 to 1.00 Period ending December 2004 1.0 to 1.00 Full fiscal year 2005 1.0 to 1.00 Full fiscal year 2006 0.9 to 1.00 At December 28, 2003, FASL LLCs net domestic cash totaled $208 million, and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. FASL JAPAN Term Loan and Guarantee Because most amounts under the FASL JAPAN Term Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 28, 2003 of 107.19 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. As a result of the FASL LLC transaction, the Manufacturing Joint Ventures third party loans were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 18 billion yen (approximately $168 million on December 28, 2003) entered into between FASL JAPAN and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsus current debt rating and FASL JAPANs non consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. The interest rate was 0.98 percent as of December 28, 2003. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. FASL JAPANs assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Also, Fujitsu guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. Under this loan agreement, FASL JAPAN is required to comply with the following financial covenants: Ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six month period during such fiscal year; Maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the loan agreement), as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of not less than 60 billion yen; Maintain total net income plus depreciation, as of the last day of each fiscal period, as follows: Period Amount Fiscal year 2003 $78 million First fiscal quarter of 2004 $23 million First and second fiscal quarters of 2004 $68 million Fiscal year 2004 $214 million Fiscal year 2005 $197 million Fiscal year 2006 $182 million 37 Table of Contents Ensure that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of (i) interest expense for such period plus (ii) scheduled amortization of debt for borrowed money (as defined in the loan agreement) for such period, including lease rentals plus (iii) maintenance capital expenditures for FASL JAPANs existing and after acquired real property and improvements at its manufacturing facilities located in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, is not less than: Period Percentage First through Fourth Fiscal Quarters of 2003 90 % First Fiscal Quarter of 2004 100 % Second Fiscal Quarter of 2004 110 % Third and Fourth Fiscal Quarters of 2004 120 % Fiscal Year 2005 120 % Fiscal Year 2006 120 % As of December 28, 2003, FASL JAPAN was in compliance with these financial covenants. Fujitsu Cash Note As a result of the FASL LLC transaction, Fujitsu also loaned $40 million to FASL LLC pursuant to a promissory note. The note bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.14 percent as of December 28, 2003, and has a term of three years. The note is repayable in four equal payments, including interest, on September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Capital Lease Obligations On July 16, 2003, FASL JAPAN entered into a sale leaseback transaction for certain equipment with a third party financial institution in the amount of 12 billion yen (approximately $100 million on July 16, 2003) in cash proceeds. Upon execution of the agreement, the equipment had a net book value of approximately $168 million. As the term on the leaseback transaction is more than 75 percent of the remaining economic lives of the equipment, we are accounting for the transaction as a capital lease. We recognized an immediate loss of $16 million on the transaction due to the fact that the fair market value of the equipment was less than its net book value at the time of the transaction. We also recorded a deferred loss of approximately $52 million which is being amortized over the term of the lease in proportion to the amortization of the underlying leased assets. We guaranteed 50 percent of the outstanding obligations, under the lease arrangement. As of December 28, 2003, the outstanding lease obligations under this agreement were approximately $86 million. In addition, FASL LLC and its subsidiaries also entered into other capital lease and leaseback transactions during the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in additional capital lease obligations of $159 million as of December 28, 2003. Accordingly, as of December 28, 2003, FASL LLC had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of approximately $245 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2007. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. We guaranteed approximately $147 million of FASL LLCs aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations as of December 28, 2003. Other Long term Liabilities Included in other long term liabilities as of December 28, 2003 is approximately $99 million of restructuring accrual that will be paid through 2011 and approximately $18 million in customer cash deposits related to multi year supply agreements for Spansion Flash memory products that will be paid through 2005, which guarantee customers purchases of these products. Excluded from contractual cash obligations is approximately $263 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 project and a $23 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, as these liabilities do not require cash payments. 38 Table of Contents Principal contractual cash obligations that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 28, 2003 were: Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andbeyond (In Thousands) Operating leases $ 466,846 $ 74,288 $ 61,096 $ 47,969 $ 40,340 $ 39,967 $ 203,186 Unconditional purchase commitments 630,136 480,109 98,301 27,239 19,154 2,710 2,623 Total Principal Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,096,982 $ 554,397 $ 159,397 $ 75,208 $ 59,494 $ 42,677 $ 205,809 Operating Leases and Unconditional Purchase Commitments We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2018. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 28, 2003, were approximately $467 million, of which $126 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing supplies and services. Total purchase commitments as of December 28, 2003, were approximately $630 million for periods through 2009. In November 2003, we announced our intention to construct and facilitize a 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36. Fab 36 will be owned by a newly created partnership named AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, or AMD Fab 36, and will be located in Dresden, Germany, adjacent to Fab 30. In November 2003, AMD Fab 36 entered into an agreement with a German entity, M+W Zander, pertaining to the design and construction of the manufacturing facility. As of December 28, 2003, AMD Fab 36 is required to make payments to M+W Zander through May 2005 in an aggregate amount of approximately $440 million. The amounts payable under the construction agreement are denominated in euro. We used the exchange rate of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 28, 2003 to translate the amounts into U.S. dollars. As of December 28, 2003, our purchase commitments also included $80 million representing future payments to IBM under our joint development agreement. As IBMs services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. Purchase commitments also included approximately $71 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2007. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements. The remaining $39 million primarily consists of purchase agreements for raw materials and office supplies. 39 Table of Contents Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheets The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 28, 2003 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2003 and their expected expiration dates: Amounts of guarantee expiration per period AmountsGuaranteed* 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 andBeyond (In Thousands) FASL LLC operating lease guarantees $ 26,604 $ 12,279 $ 8,367 $ 5,958 $ $ $ AMTC payment guarantee 39,793 39,793 AMTC term loan guarantee 31,088 31,088 AMTC rental guarantee 145,811 145,811 ** Total guarantee $ 243,296 $ 43,367 $ 8,367 $ 5,958 $ 39,793 $ $ 145,811 * Amounts guaranteed represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. ** Amounts outstanding will diminish until the expiration of the guarantee. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to the effective date of FIN 45. FASL LLC Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by FASL LLC and its subsidiaries totaling approximately $27 million as of December 28, 2003. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by FASL LLC over the lease terms. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $149 million revolving credit facility and a $93 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, we guaranteed up to approximately $31 million plus interest and expenses under the term loan, up to approximately $40 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to approximately $17 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately $146 million. As of December 28, 2003, $73 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $81 million was drawn under the term loan. These borrowings are subject to the aforementioned guarantees except that our guarantee obligations with respect to the term loan terminated in February 2004 because the AMTC occupied the photomask facility under the rental agreement during 2003 and the rental guarantee replaced the term loan guarantee. Other Financial Matters Fab 36. A significant amount of the costs of the Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. We used the exchange rate of 0.804 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 28, 2003 to translate the amounts set forth below into U.S. dollars. We expect that over the next four years capital expenditures for Fab 36 will be approximately 40 Table of Contents $2.5 billion, of which approximately $600 million will occur in 2004. In connection with the Fab 36 project, we expect to obtain external financing of approximately $870 million in the form of loans from a consortium of banks, and up to approximately $675 million in grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony. We also expect to obtain financing of approximately $398 million from the State of Saxony, through an investment entity, and a group of European investors led by the project engineer and general contractor, M+W Zander. We will provide the balance of the funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36. In addition, upon the execution of final documentation, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2004, we will be required to guarantee 100 percent of the obligations of AMD Fab 36 under the loan agreements with the banks and to fund any shortfalls in government grants and allowances. As of December 28, 2003, we have invested approximately $25 million in exchange for our equity interest in AMD Fab 36. FASL LLC. During the four year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are obligated to provide FASL LLC with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls, if any. Generally, FASL LLC is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third party financing is not available, we must provide funding to FASL LLC equal to our pro rata ownership interest in FASL LLC, which is currently 60 percent. At this time, we believe that FASL LLC would be able to obtain such external financing when needed. However, there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding, if any, that we are required to provide during this four year period. Outlook In general, as we look ahead to 2004, we are encouraged by a recovering economy and positive projections for the semiconductor industry. During 2004 we expect to take advantage of additional cost efficiencies from our FASL LLC integration and from FASL LLCs conversion to 110 nanometer manufacturing process technology on certain of its products and our conversion to 90 nanometer manufacturing process technology for our microprocessor products. During the first quarter of 2004, for our Computation Products segment, we expect net sales to decline slightly in accordance with industry seasonal patterns. For our Memory Products segment, notwithstanding typical seasonal patterns, we expect net sales to be approximately flat for the quarter due to our position in the market and improving average selling prices, which we expect will be driven by increased average bit densities in the products sold and increased shipments of products based on MirrorBit technology. In the aggregate, we believe seasonal patterns will prevail and aggregate net sales will decline slightly in the first quarter of 2004. We expect our capital investments in 2004 to increase in comparison with 2003. We plan to make capital investments of approximately $1.5 billion during 2004, including Fab 36 construction and some equipment purchases, equipment purchases for FASL LLCs wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and to complete the transition to 90 nanometer manufacturing process technology at Fab 30. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion for 2004. We believe that we will be profitable for fiscal 2004 and that gross margins will improve in comparison to 2003. However, economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand. If economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn, our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected. We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with external financing will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments in the short term. Should additional funding be required such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debts when due, or to finance the construction and facilitization of Fab 36, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. Such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings or from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration 41 Table of Contents statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe, that in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us. Supplementary Stock Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Option Program Description Our stock option programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. We have several stock option plans under which key employees have been granted incentive (ISOs) and nonqualified (NSOs) stock options to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. ISOs granted under the plans have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs range from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Section II.

On June 27, 2003, we filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC and made an offer, which was approved by our stockholders, to exchange certain stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, outstanding under eligible option plans and held by eligible employees, for replacement options to be granted no sooner than six months and one day from the cancellation of the surrendered options. The offer to exchange expired on July 25, 2003. Options to purchase approximately 19 million shares of our common stock were tendered for exchange and cancelled on July 28, 2003. On January 30, 2004, we granted options to purchase 12,111,371 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.86, which represented the closing price of our common stock on that date, in exchange for options cancelled. On that date, we also granted additional options to purchase 25,165 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $15.55 to employees of one of our foreign subsidiaries in exchange for options cancelled. We did not record compensation expense as a result of the exchange. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Variable interest entities are often created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R) which replaces FIN 46. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on identifying them and assessing an enterprises interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R applies at different dates to different types of enterprises and entities, and special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to issuance of FIN 46R. Generally, application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Risk Factors We must achieve further market acceptance for our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, or we will be materially adversely affected. We introduced our AMD Opteron processors in April 2003, and we 43 Table of Contents introduced our AMD Athlon 64 processors in September 2003. We designed these processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of 64 bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing 32 bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile PCs. The success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including: market acceptance of our new 64 bit technology, AMD64, including the willingness of users to purchase products with 64 bit capability prior to having transitioned to 64 bit computing; our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on new process technologies, including 90 nanometer silicon on insulator technology, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; our ability to successfully transition to 90 nanometer manufacturing process technology on a timely basis; the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for these processors; and the support of operating system and application program providers for our 64 bit instruction set, including timely development of 64 bit applications. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments for research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products. In December 2002 we executed an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies, particularly 65 and 45 nanometer technologies to be implemented on 300 millimeter silicon wafers, for use in producing future high performance microprocessor products. The successful and timely development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in this agreement are critical to our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule. During 2002 and 2003, we paid approximately $190 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to research and development activities. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive or that our partnerships will be successful. We have experienced substantial fluctuations in revenues since 2001, and we may experience declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. Our total revenues were $3,519 million for 2003 and $2,697 million for 2002 compared to $3,892 million for 2001. The decline from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in unit sales and in average selling prices for our Computation Products, resulting from the industry wide weakness in PC sales, and a decrease in average selling prices for our Memory Products, reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries, and the execution of our plan to align our microprocessor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted demand, which included our decision, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2002, to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers. We incurred a net loss of $274 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, and $1.3 billion for 2002, compared to a net loss of $61 million for 2001. If conditions do not continue to improve in the microprocessor or Flash memory markets in accordance with our expectations we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that, if we do, we will be able to sustain it. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has until recently been in a severe downturn that adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business. The highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. The most recent downturn, which began in the fourth 44 Table of Contents quarter of 2000, was severe and prolonged, and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged. Our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns, including the incurrence of substantial losses during the most recent downturn, as a result of: the cyclical nature of the supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; excess production capacity; and accelerated declines in average selling prices. If conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future, as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree, our business will be adversely affected. Fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us. The Computation Products segment of our business is dependent upon the PC market. Industry wide fluctuations in the PC marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of PCs sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If end user demand for PCs is below our expectations, we may be adversely affected. In addition, current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry, as evidenced by the Hewlett Packard/Compaq merger, as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. We plan for significant capital expenditures in 2004, and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities, we may be materially adversely affected. We plan for capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion in 2004. Our ability to fund these expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, including third party loans and investments for the Fab 36 project and third party financing for FASL LLCs expansion plans. Our capital expenditures for 2004 include approximately $600 million for the Fab 36 project and approximately $160 million for the Fab 30 project. In addition, FASL LLC expects to spend approximately $583 million in connection with its plans to increase the manufacturing capacity of its wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities and for other research and development activities. During the four year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are also obligated to provide FASL LLC with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs. Generally, FASL LLC is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third party financing is not available, we must provide funding to FASL LLC equal to our pro rata ownership interest in FASL LLC, which is currently 60 percent. In addition, a significant amount of the costs of the Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. When we initially forecasted our budget for the Fab 36 project, we modeled certain financial assumptions, including that the foreign exchange rate, over time, would be one euro to one U.S. dollar. Since our initial forecast, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against the euro. If the U.S. dollar continues to depreciate against the euro, the costs of the Fab 36 project would be higher than we planned, which could have a material adverse effect on us. These capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors. We regularly assess markets for external 45 Table of Contents financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon planned projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we abandon projects such as the Fab 36 project, we may have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we may be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations, and may incur additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future. At December 28, 2003, our total debt was $2.1 billion and stockholders equity was $2.4 billion. In addition, at December 28, 2003, we had up to $125 million of availability under our July 2003 Loan Agreement (subject to our borrowing base). We had also guaranteed approximately $243 million of debt, which is not reflected as debt on our balance sheet. Our high degree of leverage may: limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties debts will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not successful in integrating the operations of FASL LLC, we could be materially adversely affected. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu Limited executed several agreements that resulted in the integration of our and Fujitsus Flash memory operations. We contributed Flash memory inventory, Fab 25 in Austin, Texas, the SDC, and our Flash memory assembly and test operations in Thailand, Malaysia and China. Fujitsu contributed its Flash memory division, including related inventory, cash, and its Flash memory assembly and test operations in Malaysia. In addition, both we and Fujitsu contributed our respective investments in our previous Manufacturing Joint Venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, located in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of FASL LLC. Our anticipated benefits from this transaction are subject to, among other things, the following risks: the possibility that FASL LLC will not be successful because of problems integrating the operations and employees of the two companies or achieving the efficiencies and other advantages intended by the transaction; and 46 Table of Contents the possibility that global business and economic conditions will worsen, resulting in lower than currently expected demand for Flash memory products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate these operations or that we will be able to achieve and sustain any benefit from FASL LLCs creation. Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market, its position in the Flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a significant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and in the Flash memory market. Because of its dominant position, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. In addition, Intels significant financial resources allow it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the Intel Inside brand program and other marketing programs. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by its: pricing and allocation strategies and actions; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and user brand loyalty. Intel also dominates the PC system platform. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs we depend on third party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. In recent years, many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, these companies produce chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other components to support each new generation of Intels microprocessors, and Intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities. We do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intels six and subsequent generation processors. Thus, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our ability to develop relationships with infrastructure providers and ensure that these third party designers and manufacturers design PC platforms to support new generations of our microprocessors. A failure of the designers and producers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings, particularly our new AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron microprocessors, would have a material adverse effect on us. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect competition from Intel to increase in 2004 and beyond to the 47 Table of Contents extent Intel reduces prices for its products and as Intel introduces new competitive products. For example, in February 2004, Intel announced that it intends to introduce 64 bit processors for servers and workstations that will be able to run existing 32 bit software applications in mid 2004. We believe that these processors will compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel announced that it will offer 64 bit processors for the desktop market and other market segments that will be able to run existing 32 bit software applications in a time frame based on both timing and availability of the infrastructure required to support them, and customer demand. These products would compete with our AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300 millimeter wafers using 90 nanometer process technology. Use of 90 nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300 millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200 millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels strong position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues. If we are unable to develop, produce and successfully market higher performing microprocessor products, we may be materially adversely affected. The microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever higher performance microprocessors. To compete successfully, we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes at competitive prices. If we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices, we could be materially adversely affected. To be successful, we must increase sales of our x86 microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets, particularly the latter. Our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: market acceptance for the AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors, which rely on market acceptance and demand for our AMD64 technology; our ability to fund our planned 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility and develop associated process technologies that will be required for long term competitiveness; our ability to increase our share of the enterprise market with tier one OEM customers in order to have the demand necessary to utilize the capacity of our planned 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility; our ability to successfully market the AMD Athlon XP, AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Duron processors, which rely in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed (measured in megahertz frequency); the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in Fab 30 to 90 nanometer process technology; our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive Intel pricing strategies, marketing programs, new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors, motherboards and chipsets; our ability, on a timely basis, to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent; our ability to expand system design capabilities; and the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors. 48 Table of Contents Our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the success of our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors and the continuing success of our AMD Athlon XP and AMD Duron microprocessors. If we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors, we may be materially adversely affected. If we were to lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends on Microsofts designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, including our AMD64 technology introduced with our AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64 processors, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer for our Spansion Flash memory products in the high end mobile telephone market, or a lack of market acceptance of FASL LLCs MirrorBit technology may have a material adverse effect on us. Since the third quarter of 2002, our Flash memory product sales growth was almost entirely based on strength in the high end mobile phone market. To date, our sales in that market have been concentrated with a few customers. In addition, we expect competition in the market for Flash memory devices to continue to increase as new competitors enter the Flash memory market, particularly the NOR segment, existing competing manufacturers introduce new products or pursue aggressive pricing strategies and industry wide production capacity increases. We may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in Flash memory devices as the market develops and other competitors introduce new competing products. A decline in unit sales of our Flash memory devices, lower average selling prices, a downturn in the mobile phone market or a loss of a significant mobile phone customer, would have a material adverse effect on us. In July 2002, we commenced production shipments of the first product with MirrorBit technology. MirrorBit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard Flash memory devices. A lack of customer or market acceptance, or any substantial difficulty in transitioning Flash memory products, including those based on MirrorBit technology, to any future process technology could reduce FASL LLCs ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us. Spansion Flash memory products are based on the NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to the NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Spansion Flash memory products are based on the Boolean logic based NOR (Not Or) architecture, which is typically used for code execution. FASL LLC does not manufacture products based on NAND (Not And) architecture, which typically offers greater storage capacity. During 2003, sales of products based on NAND architecture have grown at higher rates than sales of NOR products. This has resulted in the NAND vendors gaining a greater share of the overall Flash market. Any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on NAND architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers. The recent economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide, exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East, adversely affected demand for our products. Although economic conditions began to improve in the second half of 2003, another decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If the economic slowdown returns as a result of terrorist activities, military action or otherwise, it could adversely impact our customers ability to pay us in a timely manner. 49 Table of Contents Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others, could have a material adverse effect on us. If we do not transition to 90 nanometer manufacturing process technology at Fab 30 on a timely basis, we may not be able to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products. In addition, FASL LLCs manufacturing facilities may be inadequate to meet our demand for certain Flash memory products. As a result, FASL LLC may not be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of these products to allow us to meet demand for these products from our customers. At times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by building Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in Fab 30. In addition, FASL LLC is increasing its manufacturing capacity by transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies, expanding Fab 25, JV1, JV2, and JV3 and increasing the capacity of its assembly and test facilities to accommodate both a growth in units that transition to higher densities and an increase in MCP products. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we and FASL LLC may underutilize manufacturing facilities, and we could be materially adversely affected. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow. We believe that at this time, the most significant risk is manufacturing capacity constraint. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance, and decrease costs. During 2004, we plan to transition our microprocessor production to 90 nanometer process technology, and FASL LLC intends to transition the production of certain of its memory products to 110 nanometer process technology. During periods when we or FASL LLC are implementing new process technologies, our or FASL LLCs manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. Substantial delay in the technology transitions in Fab 30 to smaller process technologies employing silicon on insulator technology and in FASL LLCs wafer fabrication facilities to smaller geometries could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. For example, Intel currently manufactures certain microprocessor products on 300 millimeter wafers using 90 nanometer process technology. Use of 90 nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300 millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200 millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in meeting the milestones set forth in our joint development agreement with IBM, upgrading or expanding existing facilities, or changing our process technologies, which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. External factors, such as the SARS virus, bird flu and potential terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, may materially adversely affect us. In early 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 50 Table of Contents had an adverse effect upon the Asian economies and affected demand for our products in Asia. A new outbreak of the virus, or a new virus such as the recent bird flu virus, could have a similar impact on demand for our products in Asia. In addition, if there were to be a case of SARS discovered in any of our operations in Asia, the measures to prevent the spread of the virus could disrupt our operations at that location. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, and ultimately affect our sales. Also as a result of terrorism, the United States may be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition, and also may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities. Intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us. The integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive. Products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition, and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, competitors enter the market, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. Failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce, on a cost effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins, would have a material adverse effect on us. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our July 2003 Loan Agreement, as amended, contains restrictive covenants and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts, and the Dresden Loan Agreements impose restrictive covenants on AMD Saxony, including a restriction on its ability to pay dividends. The July 2003 FASL Term Loan contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on FASL LLCs ability to pay dividends and also requires FASL LLC to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments, and FASL LLCs ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of the July 2003 FASL Term Loan, can be affected by events beyond our or FASL LLCs control. We cannot assure you that we or FASL LLC will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, the July 2003 FASL Term Loan and or the Dresden Loan Agreements. In addition, these agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in 51 Table of Contents cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan would cause a cross default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement and a default under the July 2003 Loan Agreement or under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes would cause a cross default under the Dresden Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we or FASL LLC were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the July 2003 Loan Agreement, the July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement and the Dresden Loan Agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our July 2003 Loan Agreement, FASL LLC has granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 FASL Term Loan Agreement, and AMD Saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the Dresden Loan Agreements. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and our 4.50% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products and FASL LLC uses in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a few foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages we purchase. Similarly, FASL LLC purchases commercial non Flash memory die, such as SRAM, from third party suppliers and incorporates these die into its MCP products. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we or FASL LLC are unable to procure certain of these materials, we or FASL LLC might have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, and Singapore; or by subcontractors in the United States and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of Spansion products are performed at FASL LLCs facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, and China. We manufacture our microprocessors in Germany. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of our Personal Connectivity Solutions and chipset products, international joint ventures for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors, and we have international sales operations. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; 52 Table of Contents Any of the above risks, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on us. As part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets. Expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above, and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets. Also, a significant portion of the manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euros while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar continues to depreciate against the euro in the foreign exchange market, our gross margins may deteriorate. Our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be otherwise materially adversely affected. Our inability to effectively implement new modules of our enterprise resource planning system could have a material adverse effect on us. In November 2003, we restarted the implementation of the sales and distribution modules of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that we initially began implementing in early 2002 and postponed from September 2002 to November 2003 as part of our cost cutting initiatives. The ERP system is intended to provide an integrated information system to serve all of AMD. We are heavily dependent on the proper function of our internal systems to conduct our business. System failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions. If we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to system operations or these additional module implementations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the semiconductor industry does not continue to improve in accordance with our expectations or undergoes another downturn or if demand for our products is lower than our expectations, we may again postpone implementation of these modules. We rely on third parties to provide supply chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and some information technology services. We rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for Fab 25 and the SDC. In addition, we rely on a third party provider in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers is governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for Fab 25 and the SDC may be adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we decided to co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and create a more variable cost structure for the company. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. Our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year. This seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in Europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the PC market during the winter holiday season. In recent quarters, a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter. 53 Table of Contents Uncertainties involving the ordering, and shipment of, and payment for our products could materially adversely affect us. Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory. While we believe inventories in the supply chain are currently at reasonable levels, market conditions are uncertain and these and other factors could materially adversely affect our revenues. Our price protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued. These agreements, which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice, generally allow for the return of our products. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. The price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property, in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to cost effectively monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms, if at all. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us or FASL LLC to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product designs or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future litigation proceedings may materially affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. 54 Table of Contents Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our corporate headquarters in California and FASL LLCs manufacturing facilities in Japan are located in earthquake zones and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake. Our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California and FASL LLCs wafer fabrication facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in Japan. In the event of a major earthquake, we and FASL LLC could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. The conversion of our outstanding 4.50% Notes could have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share and the market price of our common stock. On November 25, 2002, we sold $402.5 million of our 4.50% Notes in a registered offering. The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate potential issuance of approximately 54 million additional shares. On March 1, 2004, the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange was $14.89. If the holders of our 4.50% Notes elect to convert all or some of their notes into common stock, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 28, 2003, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short term corporate notes, short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. 55 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 28, 2003 and comparable fair values as of December 29, 2002: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total 2003Fair value 2002Fair value (Dollars in Thousands) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 256,558 $ $ $ $ $ $ 256,558 $ 256,515 $ 14,276 Weighted average rate 1.05% Variable rate amounts $ 575,614 $ 575,614 $ 576,204 $ 109,076 Weighted average rate 1.01% Short term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 18,331 $ 8,387 $ $ $ $ $ 26,718 $ 26,703 $ 336,494 Weighted average rate 2.41% 2.38% Variable rate amounts $ 100,774 $ 100,774 $ 100,860 $ 272,463 Weighted average rate 1.30% Long term investments: Equity investments $ $ $ $ $ $ 7,765 $ 7,765 $ 16,845 $ 7,885 Fixed rate amounts $ 12,100 $ 12,100 $ 12,163 $ 12,554 Weighted average rate 1.30% Total Investment Portfolio $ 963,377 $ 8,387 $ $ $ $ 7,765 $ 979,529 $ 989,290 $ 752,748 Debt Obligations Debt fixed rate amounts $ $ $ $ 402,500 $ $ 500,000 $ 902,500 $ 902,500 $ 902,500 Weighted average rate 4.50% 4.75% 4.64% 4.64% Debt variable rate amounts $ 109,586 $ 418,040 $ 383,270 $ 33,586 $ $ $ 944,482 $ 944,482 $ 697,234 Weighted average rate 3.53% 4.90% 4.86% 0.98% 4.60% 4.60% Notes payable to banks $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 913 Weighted average rate Capital leases $ 83,680 $ 84,022 $ 74,228 $ 3,899 $ 129 $ $ 245,958 $ 244,641 $ 37,229 Weighted average rate 5.40% 5.15% 4.89% 9.59% 3.90% 5.50% 5.50% Total Debt Obligations $ 193,266 $ 502,062 $ 457,498 $ 439,985 $ 129 $ 500,000 $ 2,092,940 $ 2,091,623 $ 1,637,876 Foreign Exchange Risk. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries and AMD Saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed asset purchase commitments. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We had an aggregate of $421 million (notional amount) of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in Japanese yen and European Union euro outstanding as of December 28, 2003. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 28, 2003 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. 56 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002.
