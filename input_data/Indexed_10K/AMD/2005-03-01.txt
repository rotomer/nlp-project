ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2004, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market industry standard digital ICs that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations, servers, communications equipment such as mobile phones and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products consist primarily of microprocessors and Flash memory devices. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. In 2004, we continued to focus on customer centric innovation by developing microprocessor and Flash memory products that assist our customers in adding functionality and enhancing the performance of their products. We continued to design and develop microprocessor products based on AMD64 technology, which allow our customers to protect their existing investments by continuing to use their 32 bit software applications while transitioning to a 64 bit platform. As of December 26, 2004, sales of AMD64 based processors represented approximately one half of our net sales for the Computation Products segment. In Flash memory, we continued to manufacture products based on our MirrorBit technology, which we believe will enable our customers to cost effectively include next generation applications, such as high resolution cameras and streaming video, on their mobile phone. We also introduced floating gate memory products manufactured on 110 nanometer technology and substantially completed the integration of our and Fujitsus Flash memory operations in Spansion. We also continued to devote resources to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies. During 2004, we successfully transitioned to smaller manufacturing geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products. As of December 26, 2004, we were manufacturing our microprocessor products using primarily 90 nanometer technology and we were manufacturing our highest density and performance Flash memory products on 110 nanometer floating gate and MirrorBit technology. In 2004, despite a net loss in the fourth quarter, we returned to a full year of profitability. Total net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion increased 42 percent compared with net sales of $3.5 billion for 2003. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the effects of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which include sales by Spansion to Fujitsu, for the twelve months in 2004 as compared to six months in 2003. Our transition to smaller manufacturing process geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products contributed to lower manufacturing costs per unit and higher overall gross margins, which, along with increased net sales, contributed to a net income of $91 million in 2004 compared to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. We also substantially completed the construction of Fab 36, our 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany and we are currently in the process of installing equipment. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006, will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our microprocessors. However, in 2004, the cyclical Flash memory market posed unique challenges for us. In the second half of 2004, Memory Products net sales decreased by $259 million, compared to the first half of 2004. Factors that 20 Table of Contents contributed to this decline included aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for Flash memory products. In addition, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales during the third quarter of 2004. The down turn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in Japan and a delay in our qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the fourth quarter of 2004. For 2005, we believe critical success factors include: continuing to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly in the enterprise segment; taking products based on our second generation MirrorBit technology to market and effectively ramping such products to mass production on a timely basis; strengthening our relationships with key customers and establishing relationships with new customers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully developing and continuing to transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products; developing and introducing new microprocessor products for the mobile, server and workstation markets, including dual core processors, on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; developing and introducing new Flash memory products on a timely basis; controlling costs; increasing the adoption of MirrorBit technology; and expanding our participation in high growth global markets, including China, Latin America, India and Eastern Europe. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted United States accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, restructuring charges and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with managements expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to managements judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning. Inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less, are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other 21 Table of Contents factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them in our filings with the SEC. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the assets carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Restructuring Charges. We record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur. Our remaining restructuring accruals include estimates pertaining to facility exit costs and subleasing assumptions resulting from exiting certain facilities. We review these accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates. These changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net, line of our consolidated operating statements. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time. In fiscal 2003, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. In fiscal 2004, a portion of the valuation allowance was utilized as a result of net operating profits. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our earnings. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision (benefit) line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing 22 Table of Contents jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. Results Of Operations In March 1993, we and Fujitsu formed Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing Flash memory devices. Through the Manufacturing Joint Venture, we and Fujitsu constructed and operated advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our Flash memory operations. The Manufacturing Joint Venture was contributed to a new entity, Spansion LLC, which is owned 60 percent by us and 40 percent by Fujitsu. As a result of this transaction, we began consolidating Spansions results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of the Manufacturing Joint Ventures operating results under the equity method. As Spansion did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of 2003 do not include the consolidation of Spansions results of operations. Accordingly, our operating results for the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003 are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods. Also, because we have a 60 percent controlling interest in Spansion, Fujitsus 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of Spansion is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements. This minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income (loss) of our Memory Products segment because operating income (loss) for our Memory Products segment includes operations incremental to those of Spansion. In addition, the minority interest calculation is based on Spansions net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which consisted of the microprocessor, memory products and other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment, which consisted of fees for products sold to Vantis Corporation, our former programmable logic devices subsidiary, and Legerity Inc., our former voice communication products subsidiary. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, we changed our reportable segments to the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products, and the Memory Products segment, which includes Flash memory products. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we began presenting our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because the operating loss from this operating segment exceeded 10 percent of the combined profit of all our operating segments and therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of Statement of Financial Standards 131, Segment Reporting (FAS 131). Previously, we included our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment in our All Other category. The Personal Connectivity Solutions segment includes primarily low power, high performance x86 and MIPS architecture based embedded microprocessors. In addition to our three reportable segments, we also have the All Other category, which is not a reportable segment, and which includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. However, because Spansion did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for periods prior to June 30, 2003 did not include the consolidation of Spansions operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 26, 2004, is not comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior periods presented. We use a 52 to 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, each included 52 weeks. 23 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our net sales and operating income (loss) by segment and category for 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Net sales Computation Products $ 2,528 $ 1,960 $ 1,756 Memory Products 2,342 1,419 741 Personal Connectivity Solutions 131 140 166 All Other 34 Total Net Sales $ 5,001 $ 3,519 $ 2,697 Operating income (loss) Computation Products $ 303 $ (23 ) $ (661 ) Memory Products 35 (189 ) (159 ) Personal Connectivity Solutions (72 ) (14 ) (25 ) All Other (44 ) (7 ) (380 ) Total Operating Income (Loss) $ 222 $ (233 ) $ (1,225 ) Computation Products Computation Products net sales of $2.5 billion in 2004 increased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced AMD64 based processors, particularly our AMD Athlon 64 processors, which contributed to a richer product mix. Similarly, the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors. As of December 26, 2004, sales of AMD64 based processors represented approximately one half of our net sales for the Computation Products segment. Sales increased across all geographic regions, and growth was particularly strong in North America and Asia. Computation Products net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003 increased 12 percent compared to net sales of $1.8 billion in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a 15 percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our OEM customers. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices. Computation Products operating income of $303 million in 2004 increased by $326 million compared to an operating loss of $23 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64 based products, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start up costs and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Computation Products operating loss of $23 million in 2003 improved by $638 million compared to an operating loss of $661 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in net sales and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of $330 million and marketing, general and administrative expenses of $39 million, as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and the 2002 Restructuring Plan. In addition, cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $55 million from 2002. 24 Table of Contents Memory Products Memory Products net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004 increased 65 percent compared to net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to increased demand for Flash memory products across all geographies, which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices, and the effect of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu of $1.1 billion for 12 months in 2004 compared to $449 million for six months in 2003. In the second half of 2003, demand for Flash memory products began to increase significantly, and this trend continued through the first half of 2004. In the second half of 2004, however, our Memory Products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for Flash memory products. In addition, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, due in part to channel inventory accumulation by wireless OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales during the third quarter. The downturn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in Japan and a delay in qualifying a new Flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the fourth quarter. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. Memory Products net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003 increased 92 percent compared to net sales of $741 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu during the last six months of fiscal 2003 and increased demand for Flash memory products, particularly in the second half of 2003. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between AMD and Fujitsu. Memory Products operating income of $35 million increased $224 million from an operating loss of $189 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu, for 12 months in 2004 compared to six months in 2003. In addition, our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to 110 nanometer process technology for certain of our Flash memory products in 2004 and as a result of increased shipments of Flash memory products based on MirrorBit technology, which are less expensive to manufacture than Flash memory products based on floating gate technology. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion on June 30, 2003. Memory Products operating loss of $189 million in 2003 increased $30 million from an operating loss of $159 million in 2002. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansion on June 30, 2003. Personal Connectivity Solutions Personal Connectivity Solutions (PCS) net sales of $131 million in 2004 decreased seven percent compared to net sales of $140 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $43 million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors, partially offset by a $33 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products. We acquired the Geode product line from National Semiconductor in August 2003. Accordingly, the increase in sales of AMD Geode products in 2004 was due to the fact that in 2004 we had 12 months of sales whereas in 2003 we had approximately four months of sales. PCS net sales of $140 million in 2003 decreased 15 percent compared to net sales of $166 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a $53 million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors and networking products, partially offset by a $28 million increase in sales of AMD Geode and wireless products. PCS operating loss of $72 million in 2004 increased compared to an operating loss of $14 million in 2003. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a $48 million increase in operating expenses. Operating 25 Table of Contents expenses increased due to an increase of approximately $35 million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix, and an aggregate increase of $14 million in research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our AMD Geode products and other product development. Manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more AMD Geode products, which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors. PCS operating loss of $14 million in 2003 improved compared to the operating loss of $25 million in 2002. The improvement was primarily due to sales of $12 million of certain embedded microprocessors and networking products that had been previously written off. All Other Category There were no net sales generated in the All Other category in 2003 or 2004. All Other net sales of zero in 2003 decreased from $34 million in 2002 due to the discontinuation of our Foundry Services in 2002. All Other operating loss of $44 million in 2004 increased from $6 million in 2003, primarily due to an increase of approximately $30 million in corporate bonus and profit sharing expense. In addition, All Other operating loss in 2004 included approximately $5 million of restructuring and other special charges, while in 2003 we had a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge. All Other operating loss of $6 million in 2003 improved by $374 million compared to an operating loss of $380 million in 2002, primarily due to $331 million of restructuring and other special charges included in the All Other category for 2002, compared to a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in 2003. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income and Other, Net, Interest Expense and Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions except forpercentages) Cost of sales $ 3,033 $ 2,327 $ 2,106 Gross margin 39 % 34 % 22 % Research and development expense $ 935 $ 852 $ 816 Marketing, general and administrative expense 807 587 670 Restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net 5 (14 ) 331 Interest income and other, net 31 (21 ) (32 ) Interest expense 112 110 71 Income tax provision 6 3 45 Gross margin percentage increased to 39 percent in 2004 compared to 34 percent in 2003. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 42 percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller, more cost efficient, manufacturing process technologies for both of our microprocessors and Flash memory products. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansions operating results as of June 30, 2003. Gross margin percentage increased to 34 percent in 2003 compared to 22 percent in 2002. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 30 percent, accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent. Our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, microprocessor unit sales 26 Table of Contents increased 15 percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent, and we realized revenues of $63 million, or approximately two gross margin percentage points, from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansions operating results as of June 30, 2003. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $67.1 million in 2004, $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002. Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, an increase in start up costs of approximately $29 million associated with the Fab 36 project and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002, due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million paid to IBM to jointly develop new process technologies for use in future microprocessor products. The increases in research and development expenses were offset by a $35 million reduction in research and development costs, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes. We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $20.7 million in 2004, $29 million in 2003 and $21.8 million in 2002. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $807 million in 2004 increased 37 percent compared to $587 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $112 million primarily associated with our AMD 64 based processors, expenses from Spansion of $153 million for 12 months of 2004 compared to $78 million for six months in 2003 and new regulatory compliance costs of $15 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $587 million in 2003 decreased 12 percent compared to $670 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $55 million and cost reductions from the 2002 Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives. Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. As part of this plan, and as a result of our agreement with IBM to jointly develop future generations of our microprocessor manufacturing process technology, we ceased microprocessor related research and development in the SDC and eliminated most of the related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC. 27 Table of Contents The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. Pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of $330.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, consisting primarily of $68.8 million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs, an asset impairment charge of $32.5 million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued microprocessor development activities, asset impairment charges of $30.6 million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in microprocessor process development and manufacturing activities, anticipated exit costs of $138.9 million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of $55.5 million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed ERP software and other information technology implementation activities. During 2003, management approved the sale of additional equipment primarily used in the SDC that was identified as no longer useful in our operations. As a result, we recorded approximately $11 million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2003, including $3.3 million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment. During 2003, we also revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan from 2,000 to 1,800 in response to the additional resources required due to the Spansion transaction. As a result, we reversed $8.9 million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual. As of December 26, 2004, 1,786 employees had been terminated pursuant to the 2002 Restructuring Plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of $60 million in severance and employee benefit costs. During 2004, we adjusted the restructuring accrual related to the 2002 Restructuring Plan, which resulted in an additional $5.2 million restructuring charge for the period. The adjustment was primarily related to a change in our estimate of potential sublease opportunities associated with abandoned facilities located in Sunnyvale, California. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. With the formation of Spansion and other business changes, we no longer track the overall cost savings from the 2002 Restructuring Plan because we do not believe this information would be useful. 28 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 26, 2004: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits AssetImpairment Exit andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherRestructuringCharges Total (in thousands) 2002 provision $ 68,770 $ 118,590 $ 138,900 $ 4,315 $ 330,575 Non cash charges (118,590 ) (118,590 ) Cash charges (14,350 ) (795 ) (15,145 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 2003 provision $ 7,791 $ 3,314 $ 11,105 Cash charges (38,816 ) (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non cash charges (7,791 ) (7,791 ) Non cash adjustments (8,864 ) (15 ) (8,879 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 $ 120,623 $ 127,363 Cash charges (6,789 ) (20,150 ) (26,939 ) Non cash adjustments $ 49 $ 5,203 $ 5,252 Accruals at December 26, 2004 $ 105,676 $ 105,676 Effects of 2001 Restructuring Plan In 2001, in response to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues, we implemented a restructuring plan (the 2001 Restructuring Plan). We completed our execution of the 2001 Restructuring Plan as of December 26, 2004. During 2003, we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by $12.2 million based on the most current information available and we realized a recovery of approximately $3.9 million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that we determined was impaired as a result of the 2001 Restructuring Plan. Both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net. With the formation of Spansion and other business changes, we no longer track the overall cost savings from this 2001 Restructuring Plan because we do not believe the information would be useful. The following table summarizes activity under the 2001 Restructuring Plan from December 30, 2001 through December 26, 2004: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits Facilities andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherFacilitiesExitCosts Total (in thousands) Accruals at December 30, 2001 $ 26,622 $ 15,500 $ 646 $ 42,768 Cash charges (26,622 ) (445 ) (27,067 ) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ $ 15,055 $ 646 $ 15,701 Non cash adjustments (11,574 ) (646 ) (12,220 ) Cash charges (2,485 ) (2,485 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ $ 996 $ $ 996 Cash charges (991 ) (991 ) Non cash adjustments (5 ) (5 ) Accruals at December 26, 2004 $ $ $ $ 29 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net We recorded a net charge of interest income and other, net of $31 million in 2004 compared to interest income and other, net of approximately $21 million in 2003. This charge was due primarily to a charge of approximately $32 million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) for our common stock. The charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. In addition, interest income and other, net, in 2004 included a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of the Dresden Term Loan, and a loss of approximately $6 million during the second quarter of 2004 resulting from the mark to market of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG, which do not qualify as accounting hedges. Interest income and other, net, of approximately $21 million in 2003 decreased 34 percent from $32 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of $16 million caused by lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances and a charge of $2.3 million in 2003 for other than temporary declines in our equity investments. This decrease was offset by a gain of approximately $6 million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to Spansion. Fujitsu now owns a 40 percent interest in these assets. The gain on the deemed sale of these assets to Spansion was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction. Interest Expense Interest expense of $112 million in 2004 was flat compared to $110 million in 2003. On October 29, 2004, we sold $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes). Interest accrued on the 7.75% Notes was partially offset by the absence of interest expense, as of November 2, 2004, for amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, which we prepaid on November 2, 2004, and the absence of interest expense with respect to $201 million of our 4.50% Notes, which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004. We also capitalized interest during 2004 of $9 million in connection with our Fab 36 construction activities in Dresden, Germany. Interest expense of $110 million in 2003 increased 55 percent compared to $71 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to annual interest charges of $18 million on our 4.50% Notes sold in November 2002, $5 million of interest on $110 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and the Spansion transaction, which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $9 million in 2003. In addition, in 2002 we capitalized interest of $10.7 million on continued expansion and facilitization of Fabs 25 and 30 compared to $1.5 million in 2003. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $6 million in 2004, $3 million in 2003 and $45 million in 2002. The income tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects U.S. income taxes, including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations, partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of U.S. deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter, due to continuing substantial operating losses in the United States. As of December 26, 2004, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $930 million and $45 million. We also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $88 million. We also had 30 Table of Contents federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $246 million and $86 million. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2005 through 2024, if not utilized. We maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets ($694 million at December 26, 2004) because of our history of recent losses. Other Items International sales as a percent of net sales were 79 percent in 2004, 80 percent in 2003 and 73 percent in 2002. During 2004 and 2003, approximately 22 and 15 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, as compared to one percent during 2002. The increase in the percentage in 2004 and 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the consolidation of Spansions results of operations, effective June 30, 2003, which include sales by Spansion to Fujitsu, which are denominated in yen. Our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen denominated manufacturing costs. In addition, we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in Fab 30, which are denominated in euro. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro, but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our Fab 30 and Fab 36 manufacturing costs. The impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material, on an annual basis, principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, below. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 26, 2004 totaled $1.2 billion, which included approximately $196 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of Spansion. Spansions operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash for operations or to distribute it to us and Fujitsu. Pursuant to the operating agreement, and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements, Spansion must first distribute any cash balance to us and Fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each partys estimated tax liability, if any, related to Spansions taxable income for each fiscal year. Any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by Spansion to fund its operations in accordance with its budget. If any cash remains, it must be used to repay Spansions outstanding debt to us and Fujitsu. Any remaining cash may be distributed at the discretion of Spansions Board of Managers, to us and Fujitsu, pro rata, based on each partys membership interest at the time of distribution, which currently is 60 percent and 40 percent. Due to our repayment of amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan on November 2, 2004 and the related termination of the Dresden Loan Agreements effective December 23, 2004, we are no longer required to maintain a compensating cash balance. Therefore, as of December 26, 2004, our compensating cash balance was zero as compared to $218 million as of December 28, 2003. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2004. Net income of $91 million, non cash charges, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and a $32 million charge associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for common stock, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2004 as compared to 2003 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales, and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of AMD64 based processors and improved market conditions. For fiscal 2004, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 23 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and 31 Table of Contents amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of Spansions results of operations. For fiscal 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In 2003, the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities primarily included payments of $90 million for a technology license from IBM and approximately $64 million of payments under the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Net cash used in operating activities was $120 million in 2002, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1.3 billion, adjusted by non cash charges. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2002 as compared to 2001 were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a 31 percent decrease in net sales. At December 29, 2002, inventory increased as compared to December 29, 2001 due to an increase of products to support anticipated 2003 sales, a change in the mix of inventory, and the impact of Flash memory production from Fab 25 following its conversion from a microprocessor manufacturing facility. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004, primarily as a result of $1.4 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $569 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $150 million from sales and purchases of available for sale securities, offset by $34 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash proceeds of $482 million from sales and purchases of available for sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired in conjunction with the Spansion transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $854 million in 2002, including $705 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment primarily for Fab 30 and Fab 25, $27 million, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Alchemy Semiconductor, and $131 million from net purchases of available for sale securities, offset by $9 million of proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $413 million in 2004. This amount included $745 million of proceeds from financing activities, including $588 million in proceeds, net of $13 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 7.75% Notes, approximately $250 million in investments from the non affiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, $60 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions, $30 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $124 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options and the elimination of our $224 million compensating cash balance due to the prepayment of our Dresden Term Loan. These amounts were offset by $898 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, including approximately $647.2 million used to prepay amounts outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, a $40 million cash note to Spansion from Fujitsu as part of the Spansion transaction, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany for the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in our compensating cash balance, which represented the minimum cash balance that AMD Saxony was required to maintain in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Dresden Term Loan. 32 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $907 million in 2002, primarily due to $486 million in proceeds, net of $14 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 4.75% Debentures, $391 million in proceeds, net of $11 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 4.50% Notes, $108 million drawn under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs, $120 million drawn under our revolving credit facility, $21 million in proceeds from equipment lease financings, $29 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, and $76 million of net capital investment allowances and interest subsidies received from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony for the Fab 30 project. These amounts were offset by payments of $325 million on debt and capital lease obligations. Liquidity We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together with currently available credit facilities (see Revolving Credit Facilities, below) and external financing, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term. We also believe that we have sufficient financing arrangements in place to fund the estimated $2.5 billion required to facilitize Fab 36. See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, below. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debts when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. Such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings, or from issuances of additional debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us. Revolving Credit Facilities AMD Revolving Credit Facility Our revolving credit facility provides for a secured revolving line of credit of up to $100 million that expires in July 2007. We can borrow, subject to amounts set aside by the lenders, up to 85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors. As of December 26, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility, we have to comply, among other things, with the following financial covenants if our net domestic cash (as defined in our revolving credit facility) declines below $125 million: restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock; maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in our revolving credit facility) as follows: Measurement Date Amount (in millions) Last day of each fiscal quarter in 2004 $ 1,425 Last day of each fiscal quarter in 2005 $ 1,850 Last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 2,000 33 Table of Contents achieve EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) according to the following schedule: Period Amount (in millions) Four fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2004 $ 950 Four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2005 and four fiscal quarters ending each fiscal quarter thereafter $ 1,050 As of December 26, 2004, net domestic cash, as defined, totaled $831 million and the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding Spansions accounts receivable, inventory and general intangibles. Spansion Japan Revolving Loan Agreement In March 2004, Spansion Japan Limited, a subsidiary of Spansion, entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with certain Japanese financial institutions in the aggregate amount of 15 billion yen (approximately $145 million as of December 26, 2004). Spansion Japan can draw under the facility until March 24, 2005. The revolving facility consists of two tranches: tranche A in the aggregate amount of up to nine billion yen (approximately $87 million as of December 26, 2004) and tranche B in the aggregate amount of up to six billion yen (approximately $58 million as of December 26, 2004). However, as described in more detail below, the total amount that Spansion Japan can draw is limited based on the value of Spansion Japans accounts receivable from Fujitsu, which are pledged as security to the lenders. As of December 26, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. Amounts borrowed under tranche A bear interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 0.55 percent. Amounts borrowed under tranche B bear interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.2 percent. Spansion Japan must first fully draw under tranche A prior to drawing amounts under tranche B. Borrowings must be used for working capital purposes and must be repaid no later than April 24, 2005. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, Spansion Japan is required to comply with the following financial covenants: ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six month (mid year) period; maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the agreement) at an amount not less than 60 billion yen (approximately $579 million as of December 26, 2004) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; maintain total net income plus depreciation of $213 million as of the last day of fiscal year 2004; and ensure that as of the last day of each of the third and fourth quarter of 2004, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of interest expenses plus the amount of scheduled debt repayments plus capital expenditures for its facilities located in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, for such period, is not less than 120%. As of December 26, 2004, Spansion Japan was in compliance with these financial covenants. As security for amounts outstanding under the revolving facility, Spansion Japan pledged its accounts receivable from Fujitsu. The accounts receivable are held in trust pursuant to the terms of a trust agreement. Under the trust agreement, Spansion Japan is required to maintain the value of its accounts receivable at specified thresholds (as defined by the trust agreement), based upon the amounts outstanding under tranche A and tranche B. In addition, the trustee collects payments from Fujitsu into a separate trust account and releases these amounts to Spansion Japan, subject to the calculated thresholds, upon instruction from the agent for the lenders. At any 34 Table of Contents time when the accounts receivable balance in the trust account is less than the required thresholds, Spansion Japan is required to do one of the following to cure the shortfall: provide additional cash to the trust; or repay a specified portion of the outstanding loans. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become automatically due and payable upon the occurrence of specified events with respect to Spansion Japan, including: filings or proceedings in bankruptcy, failure to pay any obligations under the revolving credit facility that have become due, failure to pay other third party indebtedness where such debt exceeds 200 million yen (approximately $2 million as of December 26, 2004), or if the value of the accounts receivable from Fujitsu held in trust is below the required thresholds and such shortfall is not remedied within three business days. In addition, amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become automatically due and payable upon the occurrence of specified events with respect to Fujitsu including: filings or proceedings in bankruptcy, default by Fujitsu with respect to payments to Spansion Japan or other obligations under their purchase and sale agreement, or default by Fujitsu with respect to other third party indebtedness where such debt exceeds one billion yen (approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2004). As of December 26, 2004, the amount of accounts receivable held in the trust was approximately $166 million. Because most amounts under the Spansion Japan Revolving Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts stated above are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004 of 103.62 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 26, 2004, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table. Principal contractual cash obligations at December 26, 2004 were: Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 andbeyond (in thousands) 4.75% Debentures $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 500,000 4.50% Notes 201,500 201,500 7.75% Notes 600,000 600,000 Repurchase Obligations to Fab 36 Partners (1) 121,931 16,242 26,422 26,422 26,422 26,423 July 2003 Spansion Term Loan 44,599 27,500 17,099 Spansion Japan Term Loan 127,389 46,323 46,323 34,743 Fujitsu Cash Note 40,000 10,000 30,000 AMD Penang Term Loan 6,325 1,518 1,518 1,518 1,518 253 Spansion China Loan 32,499 32,499 Capital Lease Obligations 184,853 96,746 83,079 4,816 212 Operating Leases 430,854 76,865 63,812 51,007 44,547 39,071 155,552 Unconditional Purchase Commitments (2)(3) 1,281,200 281,662 205,951 209,301 183,774 43,074 357,438 Total principal contractual cash obligations $ 3,571,150 $ 589,355 $ 474,204 $ 529,307 $ 256,473 $ 108,821 $ 1,612,990 35 Table of Contents (1) This is the amount of silent partnership contributions received by AMD Fab 36 KG as of December 26, 2004 from the unaffiliated limited partners under the Fab 36 partnership agreements. Assuming certain milestones are met by AMD Fab 36 KG, we expect to receive a total of up to $189 million of silent partnership contributions. AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase each partners silent partnership contribution in annual installments one year after the partner has contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements. As of December 26, 2004, Fab 36 Beteiligungs had contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements, but Leipziger Messe had not contributed the full amount. Therefore, the condition precedent to our repurchase obligations with respect to Leipziger Messes silent partnership contribution had not been met. See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, below. (2) Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (3) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume or purchase commitment in the table above. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002 we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The interest rate payable on the 4.75% Debentures will reset on August 1, 2008, August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016 to a rate equal to the interest rate payable 120 days prior to the reset dates on 5 year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 43 basis points. The interest rate will not be less than 4.75 percent and will not exceed 6.75 percent. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.75% Debentures on February 1, 2009, February 1, 2012, and February 1, 2017. The holders of the 4.75% Debentures also have the ability to require us to repurchase the 4.75% Debentures in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 4.75% Debentures are convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures will be convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. As of February 5, 2005, the 4.75% Debentures are redeemable by us for cash at our option at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we may not redeem the 4.75% Debentures prior to February 5, 2006, unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 130 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 4.75% Debentures with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 36 Table of Contents 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we issued $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes are redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we may not redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock is at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on December 4, 2005 through November 30, 2006 101.800 % Beginning on December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007 100.900 % On December 1, 2007 100.000 % The 4.50% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2007, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $7.37 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Notes will be convertible into approximately 135 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $12 million are amortized ratably, over the term of the 4.50% Notes, as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 4.50% Notes in the event that we undergo specified fundamental changes, including a change of control. In each such case, the redemption or repurchase price would be 100 percent of the principal amount of the 4.50% Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 26, 2004 we had exchanged an aggregate of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for 29,391,261 shares of our common stock in a series of transactions. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a charge of approximately $32 million, which represented the difference between the fair value of the shares issued in the transactions and the fair value of shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remainder of our 4.50% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the 7.75% Notes plus existing cash to prepay the full amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium. See Repayment of Dresden Term Loan, below. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and 37 Table of Contents unpaid interest plus a make whole premium, as defined in the agreement. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price asPercentage ofPrincipal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 % Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 % Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 % On November 1, 2011 100.000 % In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the 7.75% Notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our equity securities at 107.75 percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries except Spansion and its subsidiaries, from: incurring additional indebtedness; paying dividends and making other restricted payments; making certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; creating or permitting certain liens; creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; using the proceeds from sales of assets; entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidating or merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. We also entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the 7.75% Notes, which granted the holders certain exchange and registration rights with respect to the 7.75% Notes. We agreed to: file a registration statement within 90 days after October 29, 2004 enabling holders to exchange 7.75% Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms; use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 180 days after October 29, 2004; use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an exchange offer of the 7.75% Notes for registered notes within 225 days after October 29, 2004; and file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the 7.75% Notes if we cannot effect the exchange offer within the time periods listed above. If we do not meet these deadlines, additional interest of 0.25% per instance will be paid on the 7.75% Notes until the obligations under the registration rights agreement are fulfilled. On January 20, 2005 we filed a registration statement on Form S 4 in order to enable holders to exchange the outstanding 7.75% Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms. 38 Table of Contents Issuance costs incurred in connection with this transaction in the amount of approximately $13 million will be amortized ratably over the term of the 7.75% Notes as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements We are facilitizing our new 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, in Dresden, Germany, which is located adjacent to Fab 30. Fab 36 is owned by a German limited partnership named AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, or AMD Fab 36 KG. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. Accordingly, AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. We expect that Fab 36 will produce future generations of our microprocessor products, and that it will be in volume production in 2006. AMD, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We also anticipate receiving up to approximately $735 million in grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. We expect that capital expenditures for Fab 36 through 2007 will be approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: Equity contributions from us of $792 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $1.0 billion, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated limited partners; investments of up to approximately $433 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; loans of up to approximately $947 million from a consortium of banks; up to approximately $735 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony; and a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 26, 2004, we had contributed $248 million of equity in AMD Fab 36 KG and no loans were outstanding. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The partnership has been established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partners termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. Also on April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a term loan agreement and other related agreements (the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $947 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of technical completion at Fab 36, which requires certification by the banks 39 Table of Contents technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion. We currently anticipate that AMD Fab 36 KG will attain these milestones and first be able to draw on the loans in 2006. The amounts borrowed under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in September 2007 and terminating in March 2011. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our and our subsidiaries cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, less the amount outstanding under any third party revolving credit facility or term loan agreement with an original maturity date for amounts borrowed of up to one year (group consolidated cash), declines below the following amounts: Amount (in thousands) if Moodys Rating is at least if Standard & Poors Rating is at least $500,000 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425,000 Ba3 and BB 400,000 Ba2 and BB 350,000 Ba1 and BB+ 300,000 Baa3 or better and BBB or better As of December 26, 2004, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million, and therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partners aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $792 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $271 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $162 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions are due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partners capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments 40 Table of Contents significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partners capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.7 million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of $2.8 million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messes and Fab 36 Beteiligungs contributions over time. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase Leipziger Messes silent partnership interest of $108 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing one year after Leipziger Messe has completed its limited partnership and silent partnership contributions, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs silent partnership interest of $81 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. For accounting and financial reporting purposes under United States generally accepted accounting principles, we classified the silent partnership contributions as debt, based on their fair value because of the mandatory redemption features described in the prior paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent to 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG expects to receive from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are subject to the put and call provisions referenced above. These contributions are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. Upon consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As of December 26, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG received $122 million of silent partnership contributions and $128 million of limited partnership contributions from the unaffiliated limited partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $735 million. As of December 26, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG received cash allowances of $5 million for investments made in 2003 and cash grants of $25 million for investments made in 2003 and 2004. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KGs obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. 41 Table of Contents Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: failure of any limited partner to make contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the partnership agreements or our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; AMD Fab 36 KGs noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and AMD Fab 36 KGs noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross default under our loan agreements, including the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures, 4.50% Notes and 7.75% Notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Generally, the amounts under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements and the partnership agreements are denominated in euros. However, we report these amounts in U.S. dollars, which are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate at December 26, 2004, of 0.739 euro to one U.S. dollar, to translate the amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. However, with respect to amounts of limited partnership and other equity contributions, investment grants, allowances and subsidies received by AMD Fab 36 KG through December 26, 2004, we used the historical exchange rates that were in effect at the time AMD Fab 36 KG received these amounts to convert amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. July 2003 Spansion Term Loan and Guarantee Under our July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, as amended, amounts borrowed bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.98 percent at December 26, 2004. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal and interest installments ending in September 2006. As of December 26, 2004, $45 million was outstanding under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, of which 60 percent is guaranteed by us and 40 percent is guaranteed by Fujitsu. Spansion granted a security interest in certain property, plant and equipment as security under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan. In addition, as security for our guarantee obligations, we granted a security interest in certain of our assets, including our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds. 42 Table of Contents Pursuant to the terms of the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, Spansion is required to comply with the following financial covenants during an enhanced covenant period, which occurs if either Spansions net domestic cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is below $60 million or if its net worldwide cash balance (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is below $130 million: maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) of not less than $850 million; achieve EBITDA according to the following schedule: Period Amount (in millions) For the four quarters ending December 2004 $ 550 For the four quarters ending in 2005 $ 640 For the four quarters ending in 2006 $ 800 maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan) according to the following schedule: Period Ratio Period ending December 2004 1.0 to 1.00 Full Fiscal Year 2005 1.0 to 1.00 Full Fiscal Year 2006 0.9 to 1.00 In addition, during an enhanced covenant period, Spansion is restricted in its ability to pay cash dividends to us or Fujitsu. As of December 26, 2004, Spansions net domestic cash balance was $119 million and its net worldwide cash balance was $196 million. Because Spansion was not in an enhanced covenant period, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. Spansion Japan Term Loan and Guarantee As a result of the formation of Spansion, the third party loans of the Manufacturing Joint Venture were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan entered into between Spansion Japan, which owns the assets of the Manufacturing Joint Venture, and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsus current debt rating and Spansion Japans non consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. The interest rate was 0.98 percent as of December 26, 2004. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. As of December 26, 2004, $127 million was outstanding under this term loan agreement. Spansion Japans assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Also, Fujitsu guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Spansion Japan Term Loan, Spansion Japan is required to comply with the following financial covenants: ensure that assets exceed liabilities as of the end of each fiscal year and each six month period during such fiscal year; maintain an adjusted tangible net worth (as defined in the loan agreement), as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of not less than 60 billion yen (approximately $579 million based on the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004); 43 Table of Contents maintain total net income plus depreciation, as of the last day of each fiscal period, as follows: Period Amount (in millions) Fiscal year 2004 $ 221 Fiscal year 2005 $ 204 Fiscal year 2006 $ 188 ensure that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of (a) net income plus depreciation to (b) the sum of (i) interest expense for such period plus (ii) scheduled amortization of debt for borrowed money (as defined in the loan agreement) for such period, including lease rentals plus (iii) maintenance capital expenditures for Spansion Japans existing and after acquired real property and improvements at its manufacturing facilities located in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, is not less than: Period Percentage Third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 120 % Fiscal year 2005 120 % Fiscal year 2006 120 % As of December 26, 2004, Spansion Japan was in compliance with these financial covenants. Because most amounts under the Spansion Japan Term Loan are denominated in yen, the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004 of 103.62 yen to one U.S. dollar to translate the amounts denominated in yen into U.S. dollars. Fujitsu Cash Note As a result of the Spansion transaction, Fujitsu loaned $40 million to Spansion pursuant to a promissory note. The note bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus four percent, which was 5.98 percent as of December 26, 2004, and has a term of three years. The interest rate cannot exceed seven percent. The note is repayable in four equal payments on September 30, 2005, December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Interest is payable quarterly. AMD Penang Term Loan On January 29, 2004, our subsidiary in Malaysia, AMD Export Sdn. Bhd., or AMD Penang, entered into a term loan agreement with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the loan agreement, AMD Penang can borrow up to 30 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $8 million as of December 26, 2004) in order to fund the purchase of equipment. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9 percent and is payable in equal, consecutive, monthly principal and interest installments through February 2009. The total amount outstanding as of December 26, 2004 was approximately $6 million. Spansion China Loan During the second quarter of 2004, Spansion (China) Limited, a subsidiary of Spansion, entered into two revolving loan agreements with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the revolving foreign exchange loan agreement, Spansion China can borrow in U.S. dollars up to an amount of $18 million. Under the terms of the revolving Renminbi (RMB) loan agreement, Spansion China can borrow up to RMB 120 million (approximately $14.5 million as of December 26, 2004). The interest rate on the U.S. dollar denominated loans is LIBOR plus one percent and the interest rate on the RMB denominated loans is fixed at 4.779 percent. The maximum term of each loan is 12 months from the date of each drawdown. As of December 26, 2004, Spansion China had fully drawn on the loans. 44 Table of Contents Capital Lease Obligations As of December 26, 2004, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of approximately $185 million. Obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through 2008. Leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment. We guaranteed approximately $87 million of Spansions and its subsidiaries aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2004. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2032. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future lease obligations as of December 26, 2004, were approximately $431 million, of which $106 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non cancelable purchase commitments as of December 26, 2004, were approximately $1.3 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include approximately $546 million related to contractual obligations to purchase energy and gas for Fab 30 and Fab 36 and $250 million representing future payments to IBM pursuant to the joint development agreement. As IBMs services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. Our non cancelable purchase commitments also include approximately $141 million to M+W Zander for the design and construction of Fab 36 and other related services. These payments will be made to M+W Zander as services are performed. In addition, unconditional purchase commitments also include approximately $68 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2009. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements. The remaining commitments primarily consist of non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above. Other Long Term Liabilities The only component of Other Long Term Liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of approximately $87 million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. We included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above. The other components of Other Long Term Liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of approximately $274 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $22 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Repayment of Dresden Term Loan AMD Saxony, our indirect, wholly owned German subsidiary, continues to facilitize Fab 30, which began production in the second quarter of 2000. AMD, the Federal Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks provided financing for the Fab 30 project. We currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of Fab 30 will be $2.5 billion when it is fully equipped by the end of 2005. As of December 26, 2004, we had invested approximately $2.4 billion in the Fab 30 project. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, in order to finance the project. On November 2, 2004, AMD Saxony prepaid the full amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium, and the Dresden Term Loan 45 Table of Contents and related security agreements were terminated effective December 23, 2004. We recognized a charge of approximately $14 million (included in interest income and other, net) associated with the prepayment of the Dresden Term Loan, which included the prepayment premium of approximately $8.5 million and write off of remaining capitalized financing costs of approximately $5.3 million. Also in March 1997, AMD Saxony entered into a Subsidy Agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony in support of the Fab 30 project. Under this agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony agreed to provide: guarantees equal to 65 percent of the amount outstanding under the Dresden Term Loan, which was zero as of December 26, 2004; capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $493 million as of December 26, 2004; and interest subsidies totaling $208 million as of December 26, 2004. Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $411 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $153 million in interest subsidies through December 26, 2004. AMD Saxony also received $58 million in research and development subsidies through December 26, 2004. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses. As of December 26, 2004, these amounts were being amortized ratably through December 2007. AMD Saxony has received substantially all investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies to which it is entitled. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. Under the original Subsidy Agreement, AMD Saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2003 and to maintain such headcount until December 2008. In April 2004, the German governmental authorities advised AMD Saxony that rather than maintaining employee headcount attained by December 2003 through December 2008, it would be required to maintain employee headcount attained as of December 2002 through December 2007. Beginning in April 2004, we adjusted the quarterly amortization of the grants and allowances until December 2007. In December 2002, AMD Saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Consequently, as of December 26, 2004, headcount was below the level agreed to by AMD Saxony at which AMD Saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available. Although the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the Subsidy Agreement was reduced from $563 million to approximately $493 million, this reduction did not result in a repayment of capital investment grants and allowances already received. We adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly. Sachsische Aufbaubank GmbH, (the SAB) an entity acting on behalf of the Free State of Saxony, requested that AMD Saxony exchange investment grants that it had previously received in the amount of approximately $101 million for an equivalent amount of investment allowances. AMD Saxony has agreed to repay these investment grants in 2005. AMD Saxony will receive the corresponding amount of investment allowances from the German tax authorities. There is no right of setoff between these two amounts because investment grants are co financed by the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany whereas investment allowances are financed only by the Federal Republic of Germany. Accordingly, as of December 26, 2004, we recorded a receivable for the investment allowances and a payable in a corresponding amount for the investment grants. The receivable and payable are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the exchange will not have an impact on our operating results and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents Guarantees Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 26, 2004 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2004 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. For more information on these guarantees, see Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees, above.

(2) This is the amount of silent partnership contributions received by AMD Fab 36 KG, as of December 26, 2004 from the unaffliated limited partners under the Fab 36 partnership agreements. Assuming certain milestones are met by AMD Fab 36 KG, we expect to receive a total of up to $189 million of silent partnership contributions. AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase each partners silent partnership contribution in annual installments one year after the partner has contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements. We guaranteed these obligations. As of December 26, 2004, Fab 36 Beteiligungs had contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements, but Leipziger Messe had not contributed the full amount. Therefore, the condition precedent to our repurchase obligations with respect to Leipziger Messes silent partnership contribution had not been met. See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, above. Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 26, 2004 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2004 and their expected expiration dates: AmountsGuaranteed (1) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 andBeyond (in thousands) Spansion operating lease guarantees $ 24,414 $ 13,267 $ 8,069 $ 2,052 $ 1,026 AMTC revolving loan guarantee $ 43,308 $ 43,308 AMTC rental guarantee (2) $ 153,489 $ 153,489 Other $ 5,629 $ 1,813 $ 3,816 Total guarantees $ 226,840 $ 15,080 $ 11,885 $ 45,360 $ 1,026 $ 153,489 (1) Amounts represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. (2) Amount of the guarantee diminishes as the rent is paid. 47 Table of Contents Spansion Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling approximately $24 million as of December 26, 2004. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease term. Under the provision of FIN 45, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they are for our subsidiarys performance obligations. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. The results of operations of AMTC, which we account for following the equity method of accounting, are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $162 million revolving credit facility and a $102 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, as of December 26, 2004, we guaranteed up to approximately $43 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to approximately $20 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately $153 million. As of December 26, 2004, $80 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $78 million was drawn under the term loan. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they were issued prior to December 31, 2002, the effective date of FIN 45. Other Financial Matters Spansion LLC. During the four year period commencing on June 30, 2003, we are obligated to provide Spansion with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls, if any. Generally, Spansion is first required to seek any required financing from external sources. However, if such third party financing is not available, we must provide funding to Spansion equal to our pro rata ownership interest, which is currently 60 percent. At this time, we believe that Spansion would be able to obtain such external financing when needed. However, there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding, if any, that we are required to provide during this four year period. Sale Leaseback Transaction In January 2005, Spansion Japan entered into a sale and leaseback transaction for certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the amount of approximately 8.2 billion yen (approximately $79 million based on the exchange rate as of December 26, 2004). As the sales proceeds slightly exceed the net book value of the equipment, there is a minimal deferred gain to be recognized on the sale. Under the agreement, the lease payments will be made in six equal semi annual payments and the lease will terminate on December 31, 2007. At the expiration of the lease term, Spansion Japan has the option to purchase the equipment at an agreed upon price, which we believe to be a bargain purchase option. In addition, Spansion Japan can renew the lease if the lessor and Spansion Japan both agree upon the renewal terms not later than six months prior to the expiration of the lease term. During the term of the lease, Spansion Japan is required to comply with certain financial covenants. 48 Table of Contents Outlook During the first quarter of 2005, for our Computation Products segment, we expect net sales to decline slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. For our Memory Products segment, we expect net sales to decline during the first quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 due to continued imbalance in supply and demand, continued pressure on average selling prices and seasonality. In fiscal 2005, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion, and research and development expenses, both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales, to increase primarily due to Fab 36 start up costs of approximately $200 million. We also expect total marketing, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2005, but to decline as a percentage of sales. In 2005, our strategy is to expand our position in the enterprise segment with our AMD64 based processors; to leverage our Spansion product portfolio to expand our position in the Flash memory market, and to increase the adoption of our MirrorBit technology. However, economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand. If economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations, or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn, our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected. Supplementary Stock Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Option Program Description Our stock option programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), which had previously been approved by our Board of Directors. Stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before April 29, 2004, (the Prior Plans), including those that were not approved by our stockholders, were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of April 29, 2004, equity awards are made only from the 2004 Plan. Under our Prior Plans key employees generally were, and under the 2004 Plan key employees generally are, granted nonqualified stock options (NSOs) to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. Any incentive stock options (ISOs) granted under the Prior Plans or the 2004 Plan have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs range from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, we have also granted awards of restricted stock. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.01 per share. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee or consultant. Restricted stock that vests based on continued service does not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock that vests based on performance does not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. 49 Table of Contents Section II.

(3) The listed officers are those executive officers listed in the summary compensation table in our proxy statements for our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on April 28, 2005, and the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2004 and 2003. 50 Table of Contents On June 27, 2003, we filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC and made an offer, which was approved by our stockholders, to exchange certain stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, outstanding under eligible option plans and held by eligible employees, for replacement options to be granted no sooner than six months and one day from the cancellation of the surrendered options. The offer to exchange expired on July 25, 2003. Options to purchase approximately 19 million shares of our common stock were tendered for exchange and cancelled on July 28, 2003. On January 30, 2004, we granted options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price that represented the closing price of our common stock on that date, in exchange for options cancelled. We did not record compensation expense as a result of the exchange. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement, instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes, the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments. Among other things, SFAS 123R also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and, if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date, to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification. In addition, SFAS 123R amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS 123R is effective generally for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. As of the required effective date, all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original Statement 123 will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under the original Statement 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original Statement 123. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and will adopt this statement at the effective date. Although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time, we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements. 51 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS If we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations to Fab 36 or Spansion. Our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing. In 2005, we plan to make approximately $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. Moreover, under the partnership agreement for AMD Fab 36 KG, our German subsidiaries, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to invest approximately $792 million into AMD Fab 36 KG. In addition, under the revolving credit agreement among AMD, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 KG, we or AMD Fab 36 Holding are required to provide up to approximately $1.0 billion to AMD Fab 36 KG. Loans provided to AMD Fab 36 KG under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to AMD Fab 36 KG. We are also obligated through June 30, 2007 to provide Spansion with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs. Generally, Spansion must seek any required financing from external sources. However, if third party financing is not available, either on a non recourse basis to us or with guarantees based on our pro rata ownership interest, we must provide funding to Spansion equal to our pro rata ownership interest in Spansion, which is currently 60 percent. An inability to meet our funding obligations for Spansion could, among other things, result in additional equity in Spansion being issued to Fujitsu or third parties, which would reduce our ownership in and control over Spansion. Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and/ or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. For example, if we abandon the Fab 36 project, we will have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we will be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position. As of December 26, 2004, we had consolidated debt of approximately $1.9 billion. In addition, we guaranteed approximately $227 million of obligations, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our substantial indebtedness may: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 52 Table of Contents place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, in the future. Subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. In particular, as of December 26, 2004, we and our subsidiaries would have had the following additional borrowings available: Up to $100 million under our revolving credit facility. Amounts borrowed under this facility are secured by all of our accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles (excluding intellectual property) and the related proceeds, excluding Spansions accounts receivable, inventory and general intangibles. Spansion Japan had up to 15 billion yen (approximately $145 million as of December 26, 2004) available under a revolving credit facility. AMD Fab 36 KG will have the ability, subject to achieving certain milestones, to borrow up to $947 million (based on an exchange rate of 0.739 euro to one U.S. dollar as of December 26, 2004) from a consortium of banks under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements during 2006 and 2007. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indentures governing our 4.50% Notes, 4.75% Debentures and 7.75% Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from sales of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and 53 Table of Contents consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition: The guarantees associated with the Fab 36 Loan Agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments, and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on our ability to pay dividends, and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts. The July 2003 Spansion Term Loan, as amended, contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on Spansions ability to pay dividends and also requires Spansion to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash or its net worldwide cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy the covenants, financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. In addition, our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. Similarly, a default with respect to any indebtedness in excess of $25 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures and 4.50% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our revolving credit facility, and in certain property, plant and equipment under the July 2003 Spansion Term Loan Agreement. If the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 4.75% Debentures, 4.50% Notes and 7.75% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, or if there is a significant delay in Microsofts release of an operating system that works with our AMD64 technology, our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, including the timely introduction of an operating system that works with our AMD64 technology, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. In July 2004, Microsoft announced a delay in the release of its Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003 for 64 bit Extended Systems and Windows XP 64 bit for 64 bit Extended Systems. The new Windows editions are designed to take advantage of 64 bit extensions to the standard x86 instruction set. Microsoft estimated that the release of this software will occur in the first half of 2005. Previously, Microsoft 54 Table of Contents estimated the release date for this software would be in late 2004. This delay could adversely impact the timing of development of 64 bit applications by independent software providers and the adoption of 64 bit computing by end users. As a result, this delay could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our AMD 64 based processors. We must achieve further market acceptance of our 64 bit technology, AMD64, or we will be materially adversely affected. We designed our AMD64 based processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of 64 bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing 32 bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile PCs. Market acceptance of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including: the support of operating system and application program providers for our 64 bit instruction set, including timely development of 64 bit applications; the willingness of users to purchase products with 64 bit capability prior to the availability of operating systems and software applications that take full advantage of our AMD64 technology; our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; and the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards, memory and chipsets designed for these processors. If we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, we will be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we work together to develop new process technologies. In September 2004, we amended this agreement and extended its termination date from December 2005 to December 2008. Under this amended agreement, we anticipate that from December 26, 2004 through December 2008, we would pay fees to IBM of between approximately $220 million and $250 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 26, 2004, we paid approximately $247 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume research and development activities for microprocessors internally or find an alternative partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in the joint development agreement are critical to our AMD64 based processors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule. 55 Table of Contents The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles, manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; excess production capacity; and accelerated declines in average selling prices. For example, in 2001 and 2002, we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the downturn in the Flash memory market contributed to a decline in our Memory Product net sales. If these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur, we could be materially adversely affected. Fluctuations in demand for PCs and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics may adversely affect sales of our products. The Computation Products segment of our business is dependent upon the market for computers, including PCs. Industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If end user demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. The Memory Products segment of our business is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones as well as consumer electronics, automotive electronics and other embedded applications. If demand for these devices is below our expectations or if the manufacturers of successive generations of these devices do not require NOR based Flash memory products or increasing Flash memory content, we could be materially adversely affected. Intense competition in the microprocessor and Flash memory markets could materially adversely affect us. The IC industry is intensely competitive. With respect to our microprocessor products, our competitor is Intel. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our costs on existing products or fail to develop and introduce, on a cost effective and timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins. Our principal competitors in the Flash memory market are Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics N.V., Sharp Electronics Corporation, Silicon Storage Technology and Macronix International. The Flash memory market is characterized by migration to higher density and lower cost devices and a competitive pricing 56 Table of Contents environment. In addition, ample capacity for manufacturing Flash memory products exists due to recent capital investment by some of our competitors, which is likely to further contribute to a competitive pricing environment. In the past, including the second half of 2004, the net increases of supply, meaning the difference of capacity additions less capacity reductions due to obsolescence, exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. In the second half of 2004, fluctuations in the rate at which industry capacity grew relative to the growth rate in demand for Flash memory products, particularly NOR based products, contributed to a decrease in our average selling prices and hurt our results of operations. If this continues in the future we would be materially adversely affected. To compete successfully, we must transition to technologies that meet the increasing demand for higher Flash memory content in mobile phones, consumer electronics and automotive applications, among other markets, at competitive prices. We expect competition in the Flash memory market to increase as existing manufacturers introduce new products, new manufacturers enter the market, industry wide production capacity increases, to the extent potential customers choose NAND based products over NOR based products and competitors aggressively price their Flash memory products. In addition, we and certain of our competitors have licensed non volatile memory technology called NROM technology from a third party. NROM technology allows memory devices to store two bits of data in a memory cell. NROM technology has similar characteristics to our MirrorBit technology, which may allow these competitors to develop Flash memory technology that is competitive with MirrorBit technology. Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market, its position in the Flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a dominant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and a significant competitor in the Flash memory market. Intels significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, particularly microprocessors and Flash memory products, and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: pricing and allocation strategies and actions, including aggressive pricing for Flash memory products and microprocessors to increase market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and strong brand, and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of the brand. For example, with respect to the microprocessor market, Intel exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the Intel Inside brand program and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the PC system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a PC system. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. In marketing our microprocessors to OEMs, we depend on 57 Table of Contents third party companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. In recent years, many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to Intel or exited the business. In addition, Intel has significant leverage over these companies because they support each new generation of Intels microprocessors. We do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intels proprietary bus interface protocol. Thus, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our continued success in developing and maintaining relationships with infrastructure providers in order to ensure that these third party designers and manufacturers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components support our microprocessor offerings, particularly AMD64 based microprocessors. A failure of the designers and manufacturers of motherboards, chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings, particularly our AMD64 based microprocessors, could have a material adverse effect on us. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market, to continue to be a significant competitor in the Flash memory market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We also expect competition from Intel to increase to the extent Intel reduces prices on its microprocessor and or Flash memory products and introduces new competitive products. For example, in 2004 Intel introduced a 64 bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing 32 bit software applications. This processor competes with our AMD Opteron microprocessor. In addition, Intel recently announced that it will offer dual core 64 bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of 2005. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300 millimeter wafers using 90 nanometer process technology, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture. We are currently completing our transition to 90 nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing, and we expect to transition to 300 millimeter wafers in 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five OEM and distributor customers (including Fujitsu) accounted for approximately 50 percent of our total gross revenues in 2004. In addition, our Flash memory product sales growth is dependent to a large extent on demand for high end mobile telephones and our sales in the wireless market have been concentrated in a limited group of customers. If we were to lose a significant customer, or if one of our top customers downsizes or otherwise contracts its operations, demand for our products could decrease and we would be materially adversely affected. If we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify such products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new technologies, we could be materially adversely affected. For 58 Table of Contents example, during the second half of 2004 we experienced a delay in qualifying a new Spansion Flash memory product for the wireless segment. This delay contributed to lower than anticipated Flash memory product revenues for the quarter ended December 26, 2004. Qualifying this product in accordance with our specifications and our revised schedule is critical to our ability to increase sales of our Memory Products segment. In addition, we plan to introduce our dual core microprocessors for servers and workstations in mid 2005, followed by dual processors for the PC market in the second half of 2005. If we are not able to introduce dual core processors on a timely basis or if our dual core processors do not achieve market acceptance, we will be materially adversely affected. A lack of market acceptance of MirrorBit technology could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that market acceptance of MirrorBit technology is a critical factor impacting our ability to increase Flash memory product revenues and market share and decrease the cost of products in our Memory Products segment. MirrorBit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell. A lack of continued market acceptance of MirrorBit technology, adoption of such technology at a slower rate than we anticipate, or any substantial difficulty in transitioning Flash memory products, including those based on MirrorBit technology, to any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market. Spansion Flash memory products are based on NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to NAND architecture could materially adversely affect us. Flash memory products are generally based on either NOR architecture or NAND architecture. NAND has historically been the preferred architecture for data storage because of attributes such as high densities and fast write and erase speeds. NOR has been the preferred architecture for code storage because of its fast read performance and superior reliability. To date, our Flash memory products have been based on NOR architecture, and we do not manufacture products based on NAND architecture. During 2003 and 2004, industry sales of products based on NAND architecture grew at higher rates than sales of NOR based products. This resulted in NAND vendors gaining a greater share of the overall Flash memory market. As mobile telephones and other consumer driven applications become more advanced they will require higher density Flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements. Because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications, customers may increasingly choose NAND based products. Any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on NAND architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our revenues and market share. We intend to address end markets traditionally served by NAND based products with products based on our ORNAND architecture. We are currently developing these products and if they, or any future products based on our MirrorBit technology and ORNAND architecture, fail to achieve acceptance in markets traditionally served by NAND architecture, or at all, we could be materially adversely affected. We are required to reach agreement with Fujitsu regarding certain actions of our majority owned subsidiary, Spansion, and our interests may not be aligned. We own 60 percent of the equity interest in Spansion while Fujitsu owns the remaining 40 percent. Although we are entitled to appoint a majority of the board of managers, which generally manages the affairs of Spansion, certain actions by Spansion require Fujitsus consent for as long as Fujitsu maintains specific levels of equity ownership in Spansion. In addition, based upon designated thresholds of Fujitsus percentage interest in Spansion, certain actions require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the managers appointed by Fujitsu. These actions, which primarily represent protective rights for Fujitsu as a minority member, include: major investments, acquisitions and dispositions of assets; 59 Table of Contents a merger or consolidation resulting in the transfer of more than 50% of the equity interests; settlement of major legal proceedings and other actions; approval of certain material contracts between us and Spansion; changes to the equity capital structure of the Spansion; and winding up Spansion or one of its material subsidiaries. There can be no guarantee that our interests and those of Fujitsu will be aligned with respect to such decisions and we may be unable to take steps that we believe are desirable. In addition, a reduction in our percentage interest may result in our inability to appoint a majority of Spansions board of managers, which could result in the loss of effective control of Spansion, although the results of operations of Spansion may continue to impact significantly our results of operations and we still may be required to make loans to, and guarantee indebtedness of, Spansion. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on us. At times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products. During such times, many of our costs remain fixed and cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize manufacturing facilities. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continuously modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in the development of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. We are currently completing the transition to 90 nanometer process technology for our microprocessor products. In addition, we plan to transition the manufacture of certain Flash memory products to 90 nanometer 60 Table of Contents process technology in the second half of 2005. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. One or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume. The cost of a recall, software fix, product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because some equipment and material that we purchase is complex, it is sometimes difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. In addition, certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. Although there are alternative sources available, we have not qualified these sources and we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for SOI wafers. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of IC packages we purchase. Similarly, we purchase commercial non Flash memory die, such as SRAM and pSRAM, from third party suppliers and incorporate these die into Spansion MCP products. Some of these suppliers are also our competitors in the Flash memory market. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. 61 Table of Contents We outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co source some information technology services. We rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third party provider in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. Sales of our products are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our microprocessor customers. From time to time, we enter into long term supply arrangements with our Flash memory customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. In addition, these agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products. In 2004, one of our distributors, Avnet, accounted for approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In addition, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales in 2004. Fujitsu primarily distributes Spansion Flash memory products. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price 62 Table of Contents protection rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales were approximately 80 percent and 79 percent in 2003 and 2004. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. We manufacture our microprocessors in Germany and certain Spansion Flash memory products are manufactured in Japan. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in protecting our intellectual property; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. The last economic slowdown in the United States and worldwide adversely affected demand for our products. Although economic conditions have improved since the second half of 2003, another decline in the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions or consumer confidence in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, Chinas economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and Chinese authorities have recently introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth. For example, during the third quarter of 2004, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales. If Chinese authorities are not able to stage an orderly slowdown, Chinas economy could be affected. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, ultimately affecting our sales. 63 Table of Contents Also as a result of terrorism, the United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. As a result of our foreign operations, we have sales, costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the European Union euro and the Japanese yen. For example: a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars; certain manufacturing costs for our Spansion Flash memory products are denominated in yen; some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen; sales of our Flash memory products in Japan are denominated in yen; and certain costs of our Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our U.S. dollar denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As of December 26, 2004 we had an aggregate of $483 million (notional amount) of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro and yen. However, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, even where revenues and expenses are matched, we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency. These transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products, which adversely affects demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are 64 Table of Contents buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks and other common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner. We may become a party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from using some technology, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products, increase the costs of selling some of our products, or damage our reputation. We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded. Our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations. Any failure to control the use of, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the 65 Table of Contents attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California and manufacturing facilities for Spansion Flash memory products are located near major earthquake fault lines in Japan. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect us. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 26, 2004, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short term corporate notes, short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. However, we used the net proceeds from the sale of our 7.75% Notes along with existing cash, to prepay the full amount owed by AMD Saxony under the Dresden Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest through the prepayment date and a prepayment premium. 66 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 26, 2004 and comparable fair values as of December 28, 2003: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total 2004 Fair value 2003 Fair value (Dollars in Thousands) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 511,566 $ $ $ $ $ $ 511,566 $ 511,566 $ 256,515 Weighted average rate 2.19% 2.19% 2.19% Variable rate amounts $ 281,000 $ 281,000 $ 281,000 $ 576,204 Weighted average rate 2.21% 2.21% 2.21% Short term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 2,879 $ $ $ $ $ $ 2,879 $ 2,557 $ 26,703 Weighted average rate 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% Variable rate amounts $ 274,625 $ $ $ $ $ 274,625 $ 274,625 $ 100,860 Weighted average rate 2.35% 2.35% 2.35% Long term investments: Equity investments $ $ $ $ $ $ 3,492 $ 3,492 $ 6,653 $ 16,845 Fixed rate amounts $ 13,676 $ $ $ $ $ $ 13,676 $ 13,676 $ 12,163 Weighted average rate 2.26% 2.26% 2.26% Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,083,746 $ $ $ $ $ 3,492 $ 1,087,238 $ 1,090,077 $ 989,290 Debt Obligations Debt fixed rate amounts $ 17,760 $ 27,940 $ 229,440 $ 27,940 $ 26,676 $ 1,100,000 $ 1,429,756 $ 1,927,626 $ 902,500 Weighted average rate 6.15% 6.19% 6.19% 6.49% 6.49% 6.39% 6.51% 6.51% 4.64% Debt variable rate amounts $ 116,322 $ 93,423 $ 34,742 $ $ $ $ 244,487 $ 244,487 $ 944,482 Weighted average rate 3.96% 3.96% 1.11% 3.55% 3.55% 4.60% Capital leases $ 96,746 $ 83,079 $ 4,816 $ 212 $ $ $ 184,853 $ 183,406 $ 244,641 Weighted average rate 4.76% 3.82% 7.43% 0.64% 4.40% 4.40% 5.50% Total Debt Obligations $ 230,828 $ 204,442 $ 268,998 $ 28,152 $ 26,676 $ 1,100,000 $ 1,859,096 $ 2,355,519 $ 2,091,623 Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we have sales, costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the European Union euro and the Japanese yen. For example: a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars; certain manufacturing costs for our Spansion Flash memory products are denominated in yen; some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen; sales of our Flash memory products in Japan are denominated in yen; and certain costs of our Fab 36 project are denominated in euro. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our U.S. dollar denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 26, 2004, we had an aggregate of $483 million (notional amount) of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in Japanese yen and European Union euro outstanding. 67 Table of Contents Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 26, 2004 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, even where revenues and expenses are matched, we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency. These transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003. All of our foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts mature within the next 12 months. 2004 2003 Notionalamount Averagecontractrate Estimatedfair value Notionalamount Averagecontractrate Estimatedfair value (Thousands except contract rates) Foreign currency forward contracts: Japanese yen $ 10,542 104.34 $ (73 ) $ $ European Union euro 11,846 1.1846 1,685 199,458 1.1398 17,616 Foreign currency option contracts: Japanese yen $ $ $ 58,260 115.00 $ 4,605 European Union euro 460,707 1.2869 28,375 163,400 1.1671 11,034 Total: $ 483,095 $ 29,987 $ 421,118 $ 33,255 68 Table of Contents
