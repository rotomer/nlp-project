ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2005, which are included in this annual report. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Overview We design, manufacture and market microprocessors for the computing, communications and consumer electronics markets. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Spansion Inc., our formerly consolidated majority owned subsidiary, on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through, Spansion (formerly Spansion LLC). Total net sales for 2005 of $5.8 billion increased 17 percent compared with net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion. This growth was driven by the performance of our Computation Products segment where net sales of $3.8 billion increased by 50 percent compared to 2004, due to increased unit sales and average selling prices. We believe that our strategy of developing new generations of products based on our customers needs contributed to accelerating customer and end user adoption of our microprocessors across all geographies. In particular, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005, and AMD Athlon 64 dual core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. Moreover, we believe that our sales growth in each of our product lines outpaced the industry, resulting in increased market share for us. Sales of products for the server market was the fastest growing part of our business in 2005, followed by sales of products for notebook PCs and sales of products for desktop PCs. Increasing demand from enterprises for our products allowed us to add a number of new customers. As a result, 90 percent of the top 100, and more than 45 percent of the top 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies or their subsidiaries use AMD64 technology. On December 21, 2005, Spansion Inc. completed its IPO of 47,264,000 shares of its Class A common stock. Prior to the IPO, Spansion was our majority owned subsidiary and its financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. However, due to Spansions IPO, our ownership interest in Spansion was diluted from 60 percent to 37.9 percent. As a result, we no longer exercise control over Spansion and we no longer consolidate Spansions financial position, results of operations or cash flows with ours. We began applying the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in Spansion and our share of Spansions net income from December 21, 2005 based on our remaining equity interest, which is currently 37.9 percent. The overall growth of our annual net sales was partially offset by the results of our Memory Products segment. In 2005, net sales of our Memory Products segment of approximately $1.9 billion decreased 18 percent compared to net sales of approximately $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansions results of operations in our Memory Products segment only through December 20, 2005 because of Spansions IPO. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansions net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 were excluded from our Memory Products net sales in 2005. Other factors that contributed to the decline in Memory Products net sales included aggressive pricing by competitors due in most cases to oversupply of products in the NOR Flash memory market and a delay in Spansions qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category, which contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the first half of 2005. During 2005, we reduced our debt and capital lease obligations by $489 million, which includes the deconsolidation of $370 million of Spansions indebtedness to third parties as a result of Spansions IPO. 24 Table of Contents Moreover, as of December 25, 2005, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.8 billion, which includes cash proceeds of approximately $260 million from Spansions repayment of amounts outstanding under loans due to us, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 26, 2004. We also substantially completed the construction and initial facilitization of Fab 36, our 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany. We intend to make production shipments of wafers manufactured using 90 nanometer technology in Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2006 and to begin manufacturing using 65 nanometer technology by the end of 2006. Our goal is to be substantially converted to 65 nanometer technology in Fab 36 by mid 2007. The additional capacity gained through the use of larger 300 millimeter wafers plays an important role in our growth plans for the next several years. We plan to add production output on a steady year to year basis, while also keeping fab utilization at consistently high levels. For 2006, we anticipate further growth in both annual net sales and market share. We believe critical success factors include our ability to: continue to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly by business enterprises, including small and medium businesses, as well as large enterprises, academic institutions and government institutions; strengthen our relationships with key customers and suppliers and establish relationships with new customers and suppliers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; ramp the production at Fab 36 and at a third party foundry on a timely basis in response to market requirements; develop and introduce new products on a timely basis and achieve efficient and timely volume production of these products; extend our portfolio of x86 technology from the traditional PC and server markets into embedded applications in such markets as storage subsystems, networking and telephony equipment, handheld computing devices, computation and office equipment products, and consumer electronics; design and deliver products that meet the demands of consumers as digital content becomes increasingly used with a variety of connected digital devices; and continue to expand our participation in high growth global markets. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on going basis, including those related to our revenues, inventories, asset impairments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with managements expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Reserves. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to managements judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results. 25 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning. Generally, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value. If we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted, additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. To the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins, we would disclose them in our filings with the SEC. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. We consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present. These indicators may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. If these or other indicators are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value. If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset(s). The new carrying value of the related asset(s) is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset(s). We may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. As of December 25, 2005, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities are subject to a full valuation allowance, which was initially established in the fourth quarter of 2002. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 25, 2005, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2005, the valuation allowance increased primarily due to the continuation of start up losses at Fab 36 in Germany net of utilization of valuation allowance as a result of operating profits in the U.S. If we in the future determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed, resulting in a benefit to our operating results. Such benefits would be recorded on the income tax (benefit) provision line of our statement of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations We review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, taxes and minority interest. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on managements judgment. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had two reportable segments: the Core Products segment, which consisted of the microprocessor, memory products and other IC products operating segments, and the Foundry Services segment, which consisted of fees for products sold to Vantis Corporation, our former programmable logic devices subsidiary, and Legerity Inc., our former voice communication products subsidiary. Effective June 30, 2003, we and Fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our Flash memory operations including our existing joint manufacturing venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, or FASL. FASL was contributed to a new entity, Spansion LLC (formerly known as FASL LLC), which was owned 60 percent by us and 40 percent by Fujitsu. As a result of this transaction, we began consolidating Spansions results of operations on June 30, 2003. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our share of FASLs operating results under the equity method. As a result of the formation of Spansion LLC effective June 30, 2003, we reorganized our operating segments and created the following two reportable segments: the Computation Products segment, which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile PCs, servers and workstations and chipset products; and the Memory Products segment, which includes Spansion Flash memory products. In addition to our reportable segments, we also have the All Other category that is not a reportable segment. It includes several operating segments as well as certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of our operating segments because our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM, does not consider these operating expenses and credits in evaluating the operating performance of our operating segments. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we began presenting our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because this operating segments operating losses exceeded 10 percent of the combined operating income (loss) of all our operating segments. Therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS 131). Previously, we included our Personal Connectivity Solutions operating segment in our All Other category. The Personal Connectivity Solutions segment includes primarily low power, high performance x86 and MIPS architecture based embedded microprocessors and products for global commercial and consumer markets. Our All Other category also includes our PIC products, which were reviewed separately by our CODM beginning in the third quarter of 2005. PIC is not a reportable segment because the net operating results for the PIC operating segment constitute less than 10 percent of the combined operating income of all our operating segments. Prior to 2005, revenue from sales of PIC products was not material. As a result of Spansions IPO in December 2005 and, our deconsolidation of Spansions operating results effective December 21, 2005 discussed above, we allocated profit sharing and bonus expenses to the specific operating segments that earned them. Therefore, these expenses are no longer included in the All Other category. The results of operations for our operating segments presented and discussed in this section follow our segment structure discussed above, and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year segment presentation. 27 Table of Contents As a result of Spansions IPO, our financial results of operations include Spansions financial results of operations as a consolidated subsidiary only through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, Spansions operating results and financial position are not consolidated as part of our financial results. Instead, we applied the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansions net income from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. Accordingly, our operating results, including the segment operating results for the Memory Products segment, for the year ended December 25, 2005 are not fully comparable with our results for 2004. In addition, because prior to Spansions IPO we held a 60 percent controlling interest in Spansion, Fujitsus 40 percent share in the net income (loss) of Spansion was reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements through December 20, 2005. This minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income (loss) of our Memory Products segment because operating income (loss) for our Memory Products segment includes operations incremental to those of Spansion. Furthermore, the minority interest calculation is based on Spansions net income (loss) rather than operating income (loss). Prior to the formation of Spansion LLC on June 30, 2003, the results of operations for periods prior to June 30, 2003 did not include the consolidation of Spansions results of operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for the Memory Products segment for the year ended December 26, 2004, is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior period presented. We use a 52 to 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in December. The years ended December 25, 2005, December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 shall refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise. The following is a summary of our net sales and operating income (loss) by segment and category for 2005, 2004 and 2003. 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Net sales Computation Products Group $ 3,793 $ 2,528 $ 1,960 Memory Products Group 1,913 2,342 1,419 Personal Connectivity Solutions Group 136 131 140 All Other 6 Total Net Sales $ 5,848 5,001 3,519 Operating income (loss) Computation Products Group $ 617 $ 266 $ (32 ) Memory Products Group (311 ) 35 (190 ) Personal Connectivity Solutions Group (55 ) (54 ) (12 ) All Other (19 ) (25 ) 1 Total Operating Income (Loss) $ 232 $ 222 $ (233 ) Computation Products Group Net sales of our Computation Products of $3.8 billion for 2005 increased 50 percent compared to net sales of $2.5 billion for 2004 primarily due to an increase of 37 percent in unit shipments and an increase of nine percent in average selling prices. Unit shipments increased due to greater demand for desktop, mobile and server products across all geographic regions, particularly in North America and Greater China. In addition, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005 and AMD Athlon 64 dual core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. The increase in average selling prices was 28 Table of Contents primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced, high performance AMD64 based processors which contributed to a richer product mix. Computation Products net sales of $2.5 billion in 2004 increased 29 percent compared to net sales of $2.0 billion in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced AMD64 based processors, particularly our AMD Athlon 64 processors, which contributed to a richer product mix. Similarly, the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors. Sales increased across all geographic regions, and growth was particularly strong in North America and Asia. Computation Products operating income of $617 million in 2005 increased by 132 percent compared to operating income of $266 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 36 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $914 million primarily due to a 37 percent increase in unit shipments, an increase of $205 million in research and development costs, and an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and a $96 million increase in Fab 36 start up costs. Computation Products operating income of $266 million in 2004 increased by $298 million compared to an operating loss of $32 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 14 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64 based processors, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start up costs and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Memory Products Group Memory Products net sales of $1.9 billion in 2005 decreased 18 percent compared to net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansions net sales into Memory Product net sales only through December 20, 2005. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansions net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 were excluded from Memory Products net sales in 2005. In addition, Memory Products net sales were adversely impacted due to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales for the Memory Products segment for 2005 are not fully comparable with net sales for 2004 because Spansions net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. Memory Products net sales of $2.3 billion in 2004 increased 65 percent compared to net sales of $1.4 billion in 2003. The increase in total net sales was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which included Spansions sales to Fujitsu of $1.1 billion for 12 months in 2004 compared to $449 million for the last six months of 2003, and also due to stronger market demand in 2004 than in 2003, particularly in the wireless category of the Flash memory market, which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices. In the second half of 2003, demand for Flash memory products began to increase significantly, and this trend continued through the first half of 2004. In the second half of 2004, however, our Memory Products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors particularly in the embedded category of the Flash memory market, where competitors began to aggressively pursue increased market share, and aggregate Flash memory product supply exceeded demand. In particular, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to excess inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China during the first half of 2004, contributed to a decline in Memory Product net sales during the third quarter of 2004. In addition, a 29 Table of Contents downturn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in the wireless handset market and delays in qualifying a product based on Spansions second generation MirrorBit technology also contributed to a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. Also, Memory Product net sales declined in the second half of 2004 compared with the first half of 2004 because Spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of lower density products for the embedded category of the Flash memory market in the first half of 2004, which we believe adversely impacted relationships with customers who did not receive allocations of these embedded products. Competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share in the second half of 2004. Spansion was unable to meet demand for these products in the first half of 2004 because in 2003 it underestimated demand with respect to these products for the first half of 2004 and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis. As a result, a significant number of end customers for lower density products were under served, and these customers chose to rely on competitors both for product supply and for their design in activities in the first half of 2004, resulting in an increased market share for those competitors in the second half of 2004 when those designs went into production. Further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between us and Fujitsu in connection with the initial formation of Spansion LLC as of June 30, 2003. Memory Products had an operating loss of $311 million in 2005 compared to operating income of $35 million in 2004. The decline in operating results was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $430 million while the cost of sales only decreased $109 million. Net sales decreased as a result of a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales for the Memory Products segment for 2005 are not fully comparable with net sales for 2004 because Spansions net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005. In addition, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. Goodwill in the amount of $16 million was generated on June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, which we accounted for as a partial step acquisition and purchase business combination. In the fourth quarter of 2005, after considering the fact that the estimated fair value of Spansion was less than our carrying net book value and after comparing the estimated fair value of Spansions assets (other than goodwill) to our carrying net book value for such assets, we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill is zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire $16 million of recorded goodwill. Memory Products operating income of $35 million in 2004 increased $225 million from an operating loss of $190 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu, for 12 months in 2004 compared to six months in 2003. In addition, our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to 110 nanometer process technology for certain of our Flash memory products in 2004 and as a result of increased shipments of Flash memory products based on MirrorBit technology, which are less expensive to manufacture than Flash memory products based on floating gate technology. Further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansions results of operations with our financial results as of June 30, 2003. Personal Connectivity Solutions Group Personal Connectivity Solutions (PCS) net sales of $136 million in 2005 increased four percent compared to net sales of $131 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to $13 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products and $8 million increase in sales of embedded processors, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in sales of networking products and MIPS architecture based products. PCS net sales of $131 million in 2004 decreased seven percent compared to net sales of $140 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a $43 million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors, partially offset by a $33 million increase in sales of AMD Geode products. We acquired the Geode product line from National Semiconductor in August 2003. Accordingly, the increase in sales of AMD Geode products in 2004 was due to the fact that in 2004 we had 12 months of sales whereas in 2003 we had approximately four months of sales. 30 Table of Contents PCS operating loss of $55 million in 2005 was flat compared to an operating loss of $54 million in 2004. The increase in net sales of $5 million from 2004 to 2005 was offset by an increase in operating expenses of $6 million. PCS operating loss of $54 million in 2004 increased compared to an operating loss of $12 million in 2003. The increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a $31 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due to an increase of approximately $23 million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix and an aggregate increase of $9 million in marketing, general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our AMD Geode products and other product development. Manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more AMD Geode products, which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors. All Other Category All Other net sales in 2005 were $6 million because of sales of PIC products. We did not generate any material sales from PIC products in 2004 or 2003. All Other operating loss of $19 million in 2005 decreased from $25 million in 2004, primarily due to restructuring and other special charges of $5 million incurred during 2004 due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue. All Other operating loss in 2004 was $25 million compared to operating income of $1 million in 2003. We incurred an operating loss in 2004, primarily due to operating expenses associated with developing and marketing PIC products. In addition, All Other operating loss in 2004 included approximately $5 million of restructuring and other special charges due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue, while in 2003 we had a $14 million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge primarily because we reduced the estimate of the numbers of positions to be eliminated in response to the additional resources required due to the Spansion LLC transaction and reversed the associated severance and fringe benefit accrual. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net, Interest Expense, Income Taxes and Other Expenses The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for years ended December 25, 2005, December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (In millions except forpercentages) Cost of sales $ 3,456 $ 3,033 $ 2,327 Gross margin percentage 41 % 39 % 34 % Research and development $ 1,144 $ 935 $ 852 Marketing, general and administrative 1,016 807 587 Restructuring and other special charges (recoveries), net 5 (14 ) Interest income and other income (expense), net 14 (31 ) 21 Interest expense 105 112 110 Loss on dilution of equity interest in Spansion Inc. 110 Income tax (benefit) provision (7 ) 6 3 Gross Margin Gross margin percentage increased to 41 percent in 2005 compared to 39 percent in 2004. The improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily due to microprocessor net sales, which comprised a greater percentage of total net sales in 2005 as compared to 2004. Microprocessor net sales carried a higher gross margin than Flash 31 Table of Contents memory net sales. In addition, the improvement in gross margin was due to a 1.5 percent increase in gross margin for Computation Products. Computation Products margin improved as a result of a nine percent increase in average selling prices discussed above, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs caused by the shift in our product mix to higher end microprocessor products. Gross margin also improved because we were better able to absorb our fixed manufacturing costs due in part to improving yields at Fab 30. The improvement in gross margin was partially offset by a 12 percent decrease in gross margin for Memory Products due primarily to a decrease of 28 percent in average selling prices in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by an increase of 14 percent in unit shipments in 2005 compared to 2004. Gross margin percentage increased to 39 percent in 2004 compared to 34 percent in 2003. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of 42 percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller, more cost efficient manufacturing process technologies for both microprocessors and Flash memory products. Further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of Spansions operating results as of June 30, 2003. We record grants and allowances that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 or Fab 36, and we recorded the interest subsidies we received for Fab 30, as long term liabilities on our financial statements. We amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses. We record the amortization of the production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $72 million in 2005, $67 million in 2004 and $46 million in 2003. The fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins. In 2005 and 2004 we capitalized construction and facilitization costs related to Fab 36. Once Fab 36 begins producing revenue generating products, which we anticipate will be in the first quarter of 2006, we will begin depreciating these costs to cost of sales. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1,144 million in 2005 increased 22 percent from $935 million in 2004 due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and increased start up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million. Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansion LLCs results of operations with our results of operations effective June 30, 2003, increased start up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of approximately $29 million and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs for new generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $44 million in 2005, $21 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003. 32 Table of Contents Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1,016 million in 2005 increased 26 percent compared to $807 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs and other expenses related to the 17 percent increase in revenue in 2005 compared to 2004. In addition, in 2005 we wrote off goodwill of $16 million, which was originally recorded in 2003, as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $807 million in 2004 increased 37 percent compared to $587 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of $112 million primarily associated with our AMD 64 based processors, expenses from Spansion of $153 million for 12 months of 2004 compared to $78 million for six months in 2003 and new regulatory compliance costs of $15 million. Effects of 2002 Restructuring Plan In December 2002, we began implementing a restructuring plan (the 2002 Restructuring Plan) to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs. With the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through 2011, we have completed the activities associated with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. The following table summarizes activities under the 2002 Restructuring Plan through December 25, 2005: SeveranceandEmployeeBenefits AssetImpairment FacilityExit andEquipmentDecommissionCosts OtherRestructuringCharges Total (In thousands) Accruals at December 29, 2002 $ 54,420 $ $ 138,105 $ 4,315 $ 196,840 2003 Provision 7,791 3,314 11,105 Cash payments (38,816 ) (20,796 ) (4,300 ) (63,912 ) Non cash charges (7,791 ) (7,791 ) Non cash adjustments (8,864 ) (15 ) (8,879 ) Accruals at December 28, 2003 $ 6,740 $ $ 120,623 $ $ 127,363 Cash payments (6,789 ) (20,150 ) (26,939 ) Non cash adjustments 49 5,203 5,252 Accruals at December 26, 2004 $ $ $ 105,676 $ $ 105,676 Cash payments (20,773 ) (20,773 ) Accruals at December 25, 2005 $ $ $ 84,903 $ $ 84,903 33 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest income $ 37,210 $ 18,013 $ 19,702 Other income (expense), net (23,639 ) (49,163 ) 1,414 $ 13,571 $ (31,150 ) $ 21,116 We recorded a net income of interest income and other income (expense), net of $14 million in 2005 compared to a net expense of approximately $31 million in 2004, an increase of $45 million. This increase was due primarily to a decrease in other expense, net from $49 million in 2004, the components of which are discussed below, to $24 million in 2005. The $24 million of other expense, net in 2005 consisted primarily of a loss of approximately $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting from the mark to market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts which became ineffective in hedging against certain forecasted foreign currency transactions that are now not expected to occur due to the change of functional currency for AMD Fab 36 KG from the euro to the U.S. dollar and approximately $14 million of commitment and guarantee fees incurred in connection with the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, interest income increased approximately $19 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 135 percent increase in average interest rates and an increase in our average cash balances. We recorded a net expense of interest income and other income (expense), net, of $31 million in 2004 compared to a net income of approximately $21 million in 2003. This expense in 2004 was due primarily to a charge of approximately $32 million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) for our common stock. The charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. In addition, interest income and other income (expense), net, in 2004 included a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of the term loan agreement between our German subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG and a consortium of banks in order to finance Fab 30, or the Fab 30 Term Loan, and a loss of approximately $6 million during the second quarter of 2004 resulting from the mark to market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to AMD Fab 36 KG, which do not qualify as accounting hedges. Interest income was flat in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense of $105 million in 2005 decreased six percent compared to $112 million in 2004. In 2004, interest expense included approximately $26 million of interest under the Fab 30 Term Loan. Because we prepaid this loan on November 2, 2004, we did not incur any interest in connection with this loan in 2005. In addition, interest expense incurred on our 4.50% Notes was $9 million in 2005 compared with $19 million in 2004 because the holders of an aggregate principal amount of $201.5 million of these notes converted their notes into our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2005, and we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of these notes in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004 for shares of our common stock. Also, during 2005, we capitalized interest of $35 million in connection with Fab 36 construction activities in Dresden, Germany, compared with $9 million in 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was the higher interest expense of $48 million incurred in connection with our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 7.75% Notes), which we sold on October 29, 2004, compared with $8 million in 2004 and interest expense incurred pursuant to capital leases which increased by approximately $10 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense of $112 million in 2004 was approximately flat compared to $110 million in 2003. Interest accrued on the 7.75% Notes during 2004 was partially offset by the absence of interest expense, as of November 2, 2004, for amounts outstanding under the Fab 30 Term Loan, and the absence of interest expense 34 Table of Contents with respect to $201 million of our 4.50% Notes, which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, we capitalized interest during 2004 of $9 million in connection with our Fab 36 construction activities. Loss on Dilution of Equity Interest in Spansion Inc. Prior to the Spansion IPO, we held a 60 percent controlling ownership interest in Spansion, and Spansions financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. Consequently, Spansions results of operations through December 20, 2005 have been included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Following Spansions IPO, our ownership interest was diluted from 60 percent to 37.9 percent and we no longer exercise control over Spansion. As a result, from December 21, 2005, the closing date of the IPO, through December 25, 2005 we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in Spansion, and we no longer consolidated Spansions financial position, operating results or cash flows with ours. This will continue in 2006. In connection with the reduction of our ownership interest in Spansion, we recorded a loss of $110 million. This loss represents the difference between Spansions book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares of Spansions common stock owned by us. As of December 25, 2005, we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in Spansion and concluded that, based on the relevant factors, there was no other than temporary impairment of the investment. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 18 (as amended), The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, if future factors indicate that a decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary, we would recognize a loss on our investment at that time. To the extent that our ownership in Spansion decreases in the future whether it is caused by disposal of our ownership interest or by Spansions issuance of additional common stock, we would record either a gain or a loss on such further dilution depending on Spansions book value and fair value at that time, which could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which this ownership dilution occurs. Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $7 million in 2005 and income tax provisions of $6 million in 2004 and $3 million in 2003. The income tax benefit in 2005 primarily reflects U.S. tax benefits realized from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and foreign tax benefits generated by Spansion in certain foreign jurisdictions. Spansions IPO did not have a material impact on our tax provision. The income tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects U.S. income taxes, including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations, partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in various foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2003 primarily reflected income tax expense generated in various foreign jurisdictions, offset by a benefit of a U.S. federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in 2003. As of December 25, 2005, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67 million and $90 million. We also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $428 million. In addition, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $274 million and $95 million. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards subject to expiration will expire at various dates beginning in 2006 through 2025, if not utilized. We maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets ($741 million at December 25, 2005) because of our prior history of losses. International Sales International sales as a percent of net sales were 79 percent in 2005, 79 percent in 2004 and 80 percent in 2003. During 2005 and 2004, approximately 14 and 22 percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen. However, as a result of the closing of Spansions IPO on December 21, 2005, we do not expect to have significant sales denominated in the Japanese yen in the future. 35 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 25, 2005 totaled $1.8 billion. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion in 2005. Net income of $165 million, adjusted for non cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, a non cash charge of approximately $110 million that we incurred as a result of the dilution of our ownership in Spansion from 60 percent to 37.9 percent as a result of Spansions IPO, and a non cash charge of $16 million in connection with our write off of goodwill that was generated as of June 30, 2003 as a result of the formation of Spansion LLC, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2005 compared to 2004 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and decreased inventories due primarily to the deconsolidation of Spansions results of operations from ours as a result of Spansions IPO. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.1 billion in 2004. Net income of $91 million, adjusted for non cash charges consisting primarily of $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Notes for common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004, contributed to the positive cash flows from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2004 as compared to 2003 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales, and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of AMD64 based processors and improved market conditions. For 2004, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 23 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 22 percent of our consolidated gross sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $296 million in 2003. Although we had a net loss of $274 million for the year, adjustments for non cash charges, which were primarily depreciation and amortization, resulted in a positive cash flow from operations. The net changes in operating assets in 2003 as compared to 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of Spansions results of operations, which include Spansions sales to Fujitsu, and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of Spansions results of operations. For 2003, Fujitsu accounted for approximately 31 percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately 13 percent of our consolidated gross sales. In 2003, the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities primarily included payments of $90 million for a technology license from IBM and approximately $64 million of payments under the 2002 Restructuring Plan. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2005, primarily as a result of $1.5 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $726 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $726 million from maturities and purchases of available for sale securities, including a purchase of $175 million aggregate principal amount of Spansions 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2016 (Spansion Senior Notes) for approximately $158.9 million, partially offset by $261 million in proceeds from Spansions repayment of amounts outstanding under promissory notes to us and $133 million cash decrease due to the deconsolidation of Spansions results of operations from ours. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004, primarily as a result of $1.4 billion used to purchase property, plant and equipment, including approximately $569 million used to construct Fab 36, and a net cash outflow of $150 million from maturities and purchases of available for sale securities, offset by $34 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $83 million in 2003, primarily as a result of net cash proceeds of $482 million from maturities and purchases of available for sale securities, $148 million of cash acquired in conjunction with the Spansion transaction and $30 million in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, offset by $570 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment. 36 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $494 million in 2005. This amount included $186 million in proceeds from borrowings by Spansion and $60 million of silent partnership contributions from the unaffiliated partners of AMD Fab 36 KG which we classify as debt, $189 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, $163 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $129 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, and approximately $90 million in investments from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. These amounts were offset by $316 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $413 million in 2004. This amount included $745 million of proceeds from financing activities, including $588 million in proceeds, net of $13 million in debt issuance costs, from the issuance of our 7.75% Notes, approximately $250 million in investments from the non affiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, $60 million of proceeds from equipment sale and leaseback transactions, $30 million of capital investment grants and allowances from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Saxony for the Fab 36 project, $124 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options and the elimination of our $224 million compensating cash balance due to the prepayment of our Fab 30 Term Loan. These amounts were offset by $898 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, including approximately $647 million used to prepay amounts outstanding under the Fab 30 Term Loan, including accrued and unpaid interest. Net cash provided by financing activities was $267 million in 2003, primarily due to $245 million received from equipment sale and leaseback transactions completed by Spansion, a $40 million cash note to Spansion from Fujitsu as part of the formation of Spansion LLC as of June 30, 2003, $155 million of capital investment allowances received from the Federal Republic of Germany for the Fab 30 project and $35 million of proceeds from issuance of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options, offset by $141 million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and a $74 million increase in our compensating cash balance, which represented the minimum cash balance that AMD Saxony was required to maintain in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant set forth in the Fab 30 Term Loan. Purchase of Spansion LLC 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 On December 21, 2005, Spansion LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spansion Inc., issued to us $175 million aggregate principal amount of the Spansion Senior Notes. We purchased the Spansion Senior Notes for approximately $158.9 million in cash, or 90.828% of face value. The Spansion Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Spansion LLC and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of Spansion Inc. or Spansion LLC. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year beginning April 15, 2006 until the maturity date of April 15, 2016. Spansion LLCs obligations under the Spansion Senior Notes are guaranteed by Spansion Inc., Spansion Technology Inc., a subsidiary of Spansion Inc., and any restricted subsidiary of Spansion that guarantees any of Spansions public debt in the future. Because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction, and we intend to sell them in 2006, we classified these notes as short term investments. Liquidity We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balances, together with available external financing, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term, including the estimated additional $1.6 billion in capital expenditures that we plan to incur for the Fab 36 project from 2006 through 2008. See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, below. Should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an 37 Table of Contents effective registration statement; through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933; or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2007 On November 25, 2002, we issued $402.5 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the 4.50% Notes) in a registered offering. Interest on the 4.50% Notes was payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2003. Beginning on December 4, 2005, the 4.50% Notes were redeemable by us at our option for cash at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that we were not able to redeem the 4.50% Notes unless the last reported sale price of our common stock was at least 150 percent of the then effective conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 trading days ending within five trading days of the date of the redemption notice. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we exchanged $201 million of the 4.50% Notes into shares of our common stock in a series of transactions. As a result of these exchange transactions, we recognized a charge of approximately $32 million, which represented the difference between the fair value of the shares issued in the transactions and the fair value of shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes. During the fourth quarter of 2005, holders of the remaining 4.50% Notes elected to convert their 4.50% Notes into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, as of December 25, 2005 the 4.50% Notes were no longer outstanding. Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees The following table summarizes our principal contractual cash obligations at December 25, 2005, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table. Because of the closing of Spansions IPO on December 21, 2005, we no longer include Spansions contractual cash obligations in the table below. Principal contractual cash obligations at December 25, 2005 were: Total Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 and beyond (In thousands) 4.75% Convertible (1)Debentures $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 500,000 7.75% Notes (2) 600,000 600,000 Repurchase Obligations to Fab 36 Partners (3) 151,924 37,981 37,981 37,981 37,981 AMD Penang Term Loan 4,831 1,525 1,526 1,526 254 Capital Lease Obligations 113,534 3,718 4,193 4,686 5,082 5,784 90,071 Other Long term Liabilities 66,288 17,649 17,892 14,986 14,958 803 Operating Leases (4) 325,530 50,826 47,738 43,942 36,124 32,953 113,947 Unconditional Purchase Commitments (4)(5) 1,388,504 490,391 279,200 226,819 62,804 56,183 273,107 Total principal contractual cash obligations $ 3,150,611 $ 584,441 $ 388,287 $ 332,846 $ 157,231 $ 109,878 $ 1,577,928 (1) On January 12, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of our 4.75% Debentures with a redemption date of February 6, 2006. Prior to the redemption date, holders of the 4.75% Debentures elected 38 Table of Contents to convert their 4.75% Debentures into 21,378,605 shares of our common stock pursuant to the original terms of the 4.75% Debentures. (2) On January 27, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 7.75% Notes with a redemption date of February 26, 2006, for the redemption of 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes. On February 27, 2006, the holders of the redeemed 7.75% Notes received 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed 7.75% Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. (3) This amount represents the amount of silent partnership contributions that we are required to repurchase from the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG. See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, below. (4) Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (5) We have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on volume or type of services we require. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume or purchase commitment in the table above. 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 On January 29, 2002 we issued $500 million of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2022 (the 4.75% Debentures) in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The 4.75% Debentures were convertible by the holders into our common stock at a conversion price of $23.38 per share at any time. At this conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Debentures is convertible into approximately 43 shares of our common stock. Issuance costs incurred in the amount of approximately $14 million are amortized ratably, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the 4.75% Debentures, as interest expense. As of February 5, 2006, the 4.75% Debentures became redeemable by us for cash at our option at specified prices expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption prices for the specified periods are as follows: Period Price as a Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on February 5, 2005 through February 4, 2006 102.375 % Beginning on February 5, 2006 through February 4, 2007 101.583 % Beginning on February 5, 2007 through February 4, 2008 100.792 % Beginning on February 5, 2008 100.000 % On January 12, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 4.75% Debentures, with a redemption date of February 6, 2006. Prior to the redemption date, holders of the 4.75% Debentures elected to convert their debentures into 21,378,605 shares of our common stock pursuant to the original terms of the 4.75% Debentures. Accordingly, as of February 6, 2006, the 4.75% Debentures were no longer outstanding. 39 Table of Contents 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2012 On October 29, 2004, we issued $600 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 22, 2005, we exchanged these notes for publicly registered notes which have substantially identical terms as the old notes except that the publicly registered notes (the 7.75% Notes) are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and, therefore, do not contain legends restricting their transfer. The 7.75% Notes mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the 7.75% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005. Prior to November 1, 2008, we may redeem some or all of the 7.75% Notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a make whole premium, as defined in the agreement. Thereafter, we may redeem the 7.75% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 103.875 % Beginning on November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010 101.938 % Beginning on November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011 100.000 % On November 1, 2011 100.000 % In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the 7.75% Notes with the proceeds of certain sales of our equity securities at 107.75 percent of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of our 7.75% Notes in the event that we undergo a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 7.75% Notes contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries from: incurring additional indebtedness; paying dividends and making other restricted payments; making certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; creating or permitting certain liens; creating or permitting restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; using the proceeds from sales of assets; entering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidating, merging or selling our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. Issuance costs incurred in connection with this transaction in the amount of approximately $13 million will be amortized ratably over the term of the 7.75% Notes as interest expense, approximating the effective interest method. We anticipate that approximately $4 million will be charged to interest income and other income (expense), net as a result of redemption described below. On January 27, 2006, we sent a notice of redemption to the holders of the 7.75% Notes, with a redemption date of February 26, 2006, for the redemption of 35 percent (or $210 million) of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 7.75% Notes. On February 27, 2006, the holders of the redeemed 7.75% Notes received 40 Table of Contents 107.75 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed 7.75% Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with this redemption, we expect to incur a loss of approximately $20 million, which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2006. We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire our 7.75% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer, when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements Our new 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility, Fab 36, is located in Dresden, Germany adjacent to our other wafer manufacturing facility, Fab 30. Fab 36 is owned by AMD Fab 36 KG, a German limited partnership. We control the management of AMD Fab 36 KG through a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 LLC, which is a general partner of AMD Fab 36 KG. AMD Fab 36 KG is our indirect consolidated subsidiary. Fab 36 will produce advanced microprocessor products, and we expect first production shipments of products manufactured using 300 millimeter wafers in the first quarter of 2006. To date, we have provided the majority of financing for the Fab 36 project. In addition, Leipziger Messe GmbH, a nominee of the State of Saxony, Fab 36 Beteiligungs GmbH, an investment consortium arranged by M+W Zander Facility Engineering GmbH, the general contractor for the project, and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are limited partners in AMD Fab 36 KG. We also anticipate receiving up to approximately $644 million in grants and allowances from federal and state German authorities for the Fab 36 project. We expect that capital expenditures for Fab 36 from 2006 through 2008 will be approximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate. The funding to construct and facilitize Fab 36 consists of: equity contributions from us of $694 million under the partnership agreements, revolving loans from us of up to approximately $890 million, and guarantees from us for amounts owed by AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated limited partners; investments of up to approximately $380 million from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs; loans of up to approximately $831 million from a consortium of banks; up to approximately $644 million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances, from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony; depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG, of which $198 million of cash has been received as of December 25, 2005; and a loan guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony of 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security. As of December 25, 2005, we had contributed to AMD Fab 36 KG the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans were outstanding. These amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. On April 21, 2004, AMD, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, and AMD Fab 36 Admin GmbH, a German company and wholly owned subsidiary of AMD Fab 36 Holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG, (collectively referred to as the AMD companies) entered into a series of agreements (the partnership agreements) with the unaffiliated limited partners of AMD Fab 36 KG, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in AMD Fab 36 KG. The 41 Table of Contents partnership has been established for an indefinite period of time. A partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners. The termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given. However, other than for good cause, a partners termination will not be effective before December 31, 2015. Also on April 21, 2004, AMD Fab 36 KG entered into a term loan agreement and other related agreements (the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG, a German financial institution, to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate Fab 36. The consortium of banks agreed to make available up to $831 million in loans to AMD Fab 36 KG upon its achievement of specified milestones, including attainment of technical completion at Fab 36, which requires certification by the banks technical advisor that AMD Fab 36 KG has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields, as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. Although AMD Fab 36 KG attained these milestones in January 2006, several conditions must still be fulfilled before AMD Fab 36 KG can draw on the loans. We anticipate that these conditions will be fulfilled in 2006. The amounts borrowed under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in September 2007 and terminating in March 2011. AMD Fab 36 KG pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, we pledged our equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 LLC, AMD Fab 36 Holding pledged its equity interest in AMD Fab 36 Admin and its partnership interest in AMD Fab 36 KG and AMD Fab 36 Admin and AMD Fab 36 LLC pledged all of their partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG. We guaranteed the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG to the lenders under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. We also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by AMD Fab 36 KG, should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state German authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantee, we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and EBITDA financial covenants if the sum of our and our subsidiaries cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, less the amount outstanding under any third party revolving credit facility or term loan agreement with an original maturity date for amounts borrowed of up to one year (group consolidated cash), declines below the following amounts: Amount (in thousands) if Moodys Rating is at least if Standard & Poors Rating is at least $500,000 B1 or lower and B+ or lower 425,000 Ba3 and BB 400,000 Ba2 and BB 350,000 Ba1 and BB+ 300,000 Baa3 or better and BBB or better As of December 25, 2005, group consolidated cash was greater than $500 million, and therefore, the preceding financial covenants were not applicable. The partnership agreements set forth each limited partners aggregate capital contribution to AMD Fab 36 KG and the milestones for such contributions. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, AMD, through AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, agreed to provide an aggregate of $694 million, Leipziger Messe agreed to provide an aggregate of $237 million and Fab 36 Beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of $143 million. The capital contributions of Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions. These contributions are due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of Fab 36. As of December 25, 2005, all capital contributions were made in full. The partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of Fab 36. We guaranteed these payments by AMD Fab 36 KG. 42 Table of Contents In April 2005, we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of Leipziger Messes silent partnership and limited partnership contributions. Although the total aggregate amount that Leipziger Messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged, the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by $59 million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount. In this report, we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the New Silent Partnership Amount. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs, first exercisable three and one half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter. Also, commencing five years after completion of the relevant partners capital contribution, Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties (other than competitors), subject to a right of first refusal held by AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin, or to put their limited partnership interest to AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The put option is thereafter exercisable every three years. Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at AMD Fab 36 KG partners meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements, investments significantly in excess of the business plan, or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. The purchase price under the put option is the partners capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner. The purchase price under the call option is the same amount, plus a premium of $4.2 million to Leipziger Messe and a premium of $2.5 million to Fab 36 Beteiligungs. The right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right. We guaranteed the payments under the put options. In addition, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of Leipziger Messes and Fab 36 Beteiligungs contributions over time. This mandatory repurchase obligation does not apply to the New Silent Partnership Amount. Specifically, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are required to repurchase Leipziger Messes silent partnership interest of $95 million in annual 25 percent installments commencing in December 2006, and Fab 36 Beteiligungs silent partnership interest of $71 million in annual 20 percent installments commencing in October 2005. On September 30, 2005, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin repurchased $14 million of Fab 36 Beteiligungs silent partnership contributions. For accounting and financial reporting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the prior paragraph. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between 11 percent to 13 percent. We record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense. The limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from Leipziger Messe and Fab 36 Beteiligungs and the New Silent Partnership Portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable, but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin. Upon consolidation, we initially record these contributions as minority interest, based on their fair value. Each accounting period, we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 percent and 13 percent. We classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation. No separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 43 Table of Contents As of December 25, 2005, AMD Fab 36 KG had received $166 million of silent partnership contributions and $214 million of limited partnership contributions, which includes a New Silent Partnership Amount of $59 million, from the unaffiliated limited partners. These contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony have agreed to support the Fab 36 project in the form of: a loan guarantee equal to 80 percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security; and subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately $644 million, depending on the level of capital investments by AMD Fab 36 KG. In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long term liabilities on our financial statements and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Currently, we amortize the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. At such time as Fab 36 begins producing revenue generating products, which is expected to be in the first quarter of 2006, we will amortize these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, we will amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment, starting from the first quarter of 2006 because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. As of December 25, 2005, AMD Fab 36 KG had received cash allowances of $68 million for capital investments made in 2003 and 2004 as well as cash grants of $130 million for capital investments made in 2003 and 2004 and a prepayment for capital investments planned in 2005 and the first half of 2006. The Fab 36 Loan Agreements also require that we: provide funding to AMD Fab 36 KG if cash shortfalls occur, including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by AMD Fab 36 KG or its affiliates; and guarantee 100 percent of AMD Fab 36 KGs obligations under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements until the loans are repaid in full. Under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements, AMD Fab 36 KG, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 Admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us. In addition, AMD Fab 36 KG would be in default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements if we or any of the AMD companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if, after the occurrence of the event, the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected. Circumstances that could result in a default include: our failure to provide loans to AMD Fab 36 KG as required under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; failure to pay any amount due under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements within five days of the due date; occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets or condition of AMD Fab 36 KG or AMD or their ability to perform under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements; filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Fab 36 KG or any limited partner; occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Fab 36 Loan Agreements) of AMD; 44 Table of Contents AMD Fab 36 KGs noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on payment of profits, dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness, disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt; and AMD Fab 36 KGs noncompliance with certain financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum interest cover ratio, loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant. In general, any default with respect to other indebtedness of AMD or AMD Fab 36 KG that is not cured, would result in a cross default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. The occurrence of a default under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements. In addition, the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us. Generally, the amounts under the Fab 36 Loan Agreements and the partnership agreements are denominated in euros. However, we report these amounts in U.S. dollars, which are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates. We used the exchange rate at December 25, 2005, of 0.843 euro to one U.S. dollar, to translate the amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. However, with respect to amounts of equity contributions or partnership contributions, investment grants, allowances and subsidies received by AMD Fab 36 KG through December 25, 2005, we used the historical exchange rates that were in effect at the time AMD Fab 36 KG received these amounts to convert amounts denominated in euros into U.S. dollars. AMD Penang Term Loan On January 29, 2004, our subsidiary in Malaysia, AMD Export Sdn. Bhd., or AMD Penang, entered into a term loan agreement with a local financial institution. Under the terms of the loan agreement, AMD Penang can borrow up to 30 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $8 million as of December 25, 2005) in order to fund the purchase of equipment. The loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9 percent and is payable in equal, consecutive, monthly principal and interest installments through February 2009. The total amount outstanding as of December 25, 2005 was approximately $5 million. This loan was transferred to Spansion Penang in January 2006 by novation of the outstanding amounts, and therefore, this loan is no longer outstanding. Capital Lease Obligations As of December 25, 2005, we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of $114 million. These capital lease obligations primarily represent obligations under certain energy supply contracts which AMD Fab 36 KG entered into with local energy suppliers to provide Fab 36 with utilities (gas, electricity, heating and cooling) to meet the energy demand for our manufacturing needs. We accounted for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to EITF 01 8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease and SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases. These capital lease obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2020. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities, including our executive offices in Sunnyvale, California, and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built, under non cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2021. We lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Our total future non cancelable lease obligations as of December 25, 2005, were $326 million, of which $91 million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. 45 Table of Contents Unconditional Purchase Commitments Total non cancelable purchase commitments as of December 25, 2005, were $1.4 billion for periods through 2020. These purchase commitments include $559 million related to contractual obligations of Fab 30 and Fab 36 to purchase silicon on insulator wafers and purchases of energy and gas and up to $226 million representing future payments to IBM pursuant to our joint development agreement. As IBMs services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement, we expense the payments as incurred. In August 2005, we amended this agreement, and among other things, extended its termination date through December 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval of IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. Accordingly, the table above only reflects our obligations through December 31, 2008. If such approval is received from IBM, the additional obligations from January 2009 through 2011 would be between $276 million and $306 million. In addition, unconditional purchase commitments also include $107 million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through 2009. The remaining commitments primarily consist of non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials, natural resources and office supplies. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above. Other Long Term Liabilities One component of Other Long Term Liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of $66 million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our 2002 Restructuring Plan. We will make these payments through 2011. We included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above. The other components of Other Long Term Liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of $342 million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the Fab 30 and Fab 36 projects and a $20 million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California in 1998. Guarantees Guarantees of Indebtedness Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 25, 2005 related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2005 and their expected expiration dates by year. No incremental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for these guarantees. For more information on these guarantees, see Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees, above.

See Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements, above. 46 Table of Contents Guarantees of Indebtedness not Recorded on Our Consolidated Balance Sheet The following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of December 25, 2005 for which the related underlying liabilities are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2005 and their expected expiration dates: Amounts Guaranteed (1) Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 and Beyond (In thousands) AMTC revolving loan guarantee $ 37,981 $ $ 37,981 $ $ $ $ AMTC rental guarantee (2) 118,837 118,837 Spansion Japan term loan guarantee (3) 43,363 24,779 18,584 Spansion capital lease guarantees (3) 35,851 32,598 3,253 Spansion operating lease guarantees (3) 7,072 3,997 2,050 1,025 Other 3,448 3,448 Total guarantees $ 246,552 $ 64,822 $ 61,868 $ 1,025 $ $ $ 118,837 (1) Amounts represent the principal amount of the underlying obligations guaranteed and are exclusive of obligations for interest, fees and expenses. (2) Amount of the guarantee diminishes as the rent is paid. (3) Notwithstanding the Spansion IPO, we agreed to maintain our guarantees of these Spansion obligations. AMTC and BAC Guarantees The Advanced Mask Technology Center GmbH & Co. KG (AMTC) and Maskhouse Building Administration GmbH & Co., KG (BAC) are joint ventures formed by us, Infineon Technologies AG and DuPont Photomasks, Inc. for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in Dresden, Germany. In April 2005 DuPont Photomasks, Inc. was acquired by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toppan, named Toppan Photomasks, Inc. We procure advanced photomasks from AMTC and use them in manufacturing our microprocessors. To finance the project, BAC and AMTC entered into a $142 million revolving credit facility and a $89 million term loan in December 2002. Also in December 2002, in order to occupy the photomask facility, AMTC entered into a rental agreement with BAC. With regard to these commitments by BAC and AMTC, as of December 25, 2005, we guaranteed up to $38 million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan, and up to $19 million, initially, under the rental agreement. The obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through 2011 as the term loan is repaid. However, under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with BAC and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations, the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is $119 million. As of December 25, 2005, $83 million was drawn under the revolving credit facility, and $57 million was drawn under the term loan. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees because they were issued prior to December 31, 2002, the effective date of FIN 45. Spansion Japan Term Loan Guarantee As a result of the formation of Spansion LLC on June 30, 2003, the third party loans of FASL were refinanced from the proceeds of a term loan entered into between Spansion Japan, which owns the assets of FASL, and a Japanese financial institution. Under the agreement, the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of TIBOR plus a spread that is determined by Fujitsus current debt rating and Spansion Japans non consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year. Repayment occurs in equal, consecutive, quarterly principal installments ending in June 2007. As a result of Spansions IPO, the amount outstanding under this loan facility is no longer consolidated on our consolidated balance sheet. 47 Table of Contents Fujitsu has guaranteed 100 percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility. We agreed to reimburse Fujitsu 60 percent of any amount paid by Fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan. As of December 25, 2005, $72 million was outstanding under this term loan agreement. Spansion Japans assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement. Spansion Capital Lease Guarantee We guaranteed certain capital leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling $35 million as of December 25, 2005. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease terms. Spansion Operating Lease Guarantees We guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by Spansion and its subsidiaries totaling $7 million as of December 25, 2005. The amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by Spansion over the lease terms. No liability has been recognized for these guarantees related to Spansion under the provisions of FIN 45 because we concluded the fair value of the guarantees is not significant after considering various factors including the recent IPO of Spansion, its credit rating, the ability of Spansion to make the payments on these obligations and the short maturity of the indebtedness. Other Financial Matters Termination of Revolving Credit Facility. On December 23, 2005, we terminated the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of July 7, 2003 among us, AMD International Sales & Services Ltd., Bank of America, N.A., as agent and the other lenders party thereto and repaid all of our existing obligations in full. Because no amounts were drawn under this credit facility at the time of our termination, the amount we paid to the lenders, which consisted of outstanding fees and expenses, was not material. As part of the termination, the lenders terminated and released all security interests and liens held by them as security for our obligations. Secondary Equity Offering. On January 27, 2006, we closed the offering of 14,096,000 shares of our common stock. The net proceeds to us from this equity offering, after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts, but prior to deducting offering expenses, were approximately $495 million. We will use approximately $226 million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the redemption of 35 percent of the aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012. We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the possible repayment of indebtedness. Depending on our cash position, we may from time to time elect to retire certain of our outstanding debt through open market or privately negotiated transactions or by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Spansion Agency Agreement. We have entered into an agency agreement with Spansion pursuant to which we have agreed to continue to ship products to and invoice Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion until Spansion has the capability to do so on its own. Prior to shipping the product to Spansions customers, we purchase the applicable product from Spansion and pay Spansion the same amount that we invoice Spansions customers. In performing these services, we act as Spansions agent for the sale of Spansions Flash memory products, and we do not receive a commission or fees for these services. Under the agreement, Spansion assumes full responsibility for its products and these transactions, including establishing the pricing and determining product specifications. Spansion also assumes credit and inventory risk related to these product sales. 48 Table of Contents In accordance with EITF Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we record sales of Spansions Flash memory products and the related cost of sales on a net basis on our consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the net impact to our net sales and cost of sales is zero. With respect to our consolidated balance sheet, sales to Spansions customers are included in our Accounts Receivable line item whereas the payables to Spansion that relate to the products we purchased from Spansion are reflected in our Accounts Payable to Spansion line item. These amounts are recorded separately on the balance sheet because there is no legal right of offset in accordance with FIN 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. AMD/Spansion Service Agreements. We are party to various service agreements with Spansion. Under our IT Services Agreement and General Services Agreement, we provide, among other things, information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to Spansion. For services rendered, we are paid fees in an amount equal to cost plus five percent except for services procured by us from third parties, which are provided to Spansion at cost. Unless otherwise earlier terminated, each of these service agreements expires on June 30, 2007, but each of us may extend the term by mutual agreement. Spansion has the ability to terminate individual services under the general services agreements at any time and for any reason upon at least six months advance notice. With respect to the IT service agreements and general service agreements, if we failed to comply with applicable service levels for a particular service and have not rectified such performance failure, Spansion may terminate such service after 60 days have elapsed since Spansion first notified us of the failure to perform the service. Moreover, Spansion may terminate an entire IT service agreement or general services agreement if we breach our material obligations under the respective agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days after receipt of a notice of default from Spansion. Similarly, we can terminate the respective agreement for Spansions failure to make payments when due if Spansion fails to cure such default within 90 days after receipt of notice of default. Outlook We are focused on increasing sales and growing market share in a profitable manner. However we are in an extremely competitive business. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, marketing and distribution capability, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We expect sales during the first quarter of 2006 to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter of 2005. Also, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect operating expenses, which include research and development expenses and marketing, sales and administrative expenses, to increase by approximately 6 percent from comparable operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005, which excludes those operating expenses related to the Memory Products segment. In 2006, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion and depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $825 million. We expect our tax rate to be between 10 percent to 15 percent. In addition, in 2006 Spansions results of operations will continue to impact our results of operations. These results will be reflected in the Equity in Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Investee line item on our statement of operations and for 2006 will be based on our ownership of Spansion, which was 37.9 percent as of December 25, 2005. 49 Table of Contents Supplementary Stock Based Incentive Compensation Disclosures Section I. Stock Based Incentive Program Description Our stock stock based incentive programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), which had previously been approved by our Board of Directors. Stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before April 29, 2004, (the Prior Plans), including those that were not approved by our stockholders, were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of April 29, 2004, equity awards are made only from the 2004 Plan. Under our Prior Plans key employees generally were, and under the 2004 Plan key employees generally have been, granted nonqualified stock options (NSOs) to purchase our common stock. Generally, options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant. Any incentive stock options (ISOs) granted under the Prior Plans or the 2004 Plan have exercise prices of not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices of NSOs ranged from $0.01 to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. We plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units under the 2004 Plan in 2006. Under the 2004 Plan, we can also grant up to a total of 9 million shares where the exercise price is less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These types of grants can consist of the following awards: Restricted Stock. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee or consultant. Restricted stock that vests based on continued service does not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock that vests based on performance does not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units are awards that obligate us to issue a specific number of shares of our common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. Restricted stock units based on continued service may not fully vest for three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units that are performance based may not vest for at least one year from the date of grant. Discount Stock Options. Discount stock options may be subject to the same requirements and conditions as are applicable to regular NSOs described above except that the fixed exercise price may be granted at up to 85 percent of fair market value on the date of grant, if the discount is in lieu of a portion of salary or cash bonus. Options cannot be exercised until they become vested. Options expire not later than 10 years after the date of grant. On April 27, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all stock options outstanding under the 2004 Plan and our prior equity compensation plans that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of our stock on April 27, 2005, which was $14.51. Options to purchase approximately 12 million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately. Options held by non employee directors were not included in the vesting acceleration. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. On December 15, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all outstanding AMD stock options and restricted stock units held by Spansion employees that would otherwise have vested from December 16, 2005 to 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2006. In connection with the modification of the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting, $1.2 million was recorded as non cash compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123, and this amount was included in the pro forma stock compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2005. The primary purpose for accelerating the vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that we and Spansion would otherwise have been required to recognize in Spansions and our respective statements of operations with respect to these awards. If we had not accelerated the vesting of these awards, they would have been subject to variable accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF Issue 96 18 and 00 12. This accounting treatment would have applied because following Spansions IPO, we no longer consolidate Spansions results of operations in our financial statements. Accordingly, Spansion employees are no longer considered our employees. Under variable fair value accounting, we would have been required to re measure the fair value of unvested stock based awards of our common stock held by Spansion employees after Spansions IPO at the end of each accounting period until such awards were fully vested. In connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these awards, we recorded a compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1.5 million. In addition to the acceleration of vesting of certain stock awards as indicated above, there are approximately 684,000 unvested AMD stock options and restricted stock units that are still held by Spansion employees which are currently subject to variable accounting. In accordance with EITF 00 12, the resulting compensation charge will be recorded in the Companys consolidated statements of operations in the same caption as the equity in income ( loss) of unconsolidated investee.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement, instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes, the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant date fair value of the award. The grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments. Among other things, SFAS 123R also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and, if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date, to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification. In addition, SFAS 123R amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. We will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. 52 Table of Contents As of the required effective date, all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original SFAS 123 will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards, for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under the original SFAS 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original SFAS 123. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We will apply the modified prospective method, which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all share based payments granted, modified or settled after the date of adoption plus the current period expense for unvested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard. No expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods. Although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time, we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements and will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future. Due to the acceleration of options during 2005, the compensation expense previously reported in pro forma disclosures is not expected to be representative of future expected compensation expense. In addition, beginning in 2006, AMD will change its method of valuation for share based awards granted from the Black Scholes option pricing model, which was previously used for our pro forma information required under SFAS 123, to a lattice binominal option pricing model. In 2006, we also expect to issue fewer stock options than have been issued in the past, and plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt SFAS 154 in the first quarter of 2006 and do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). This statement clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. In addition, the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement became effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this statement at the beginning of 2006. Because we are already in compliance with SFAS 151, the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 53 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile PCs for many years. Intel is also a dominant competitor in the server category of the microprocessor market. Intels significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including pricing and allocation strategies and actions, such as aggressive pricing for microprocessors to increase market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. For example, Intel exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the PC system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a PC system. As a result, PC OEMs are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300 millimeter wafers using 65 nanometer process technology whereas we expect to make our first production shipments of products manufactured on 300 millimeter wafers using 90 nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2006. We expect to begin commercial shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 65 nanometer technology by the end of 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products, which may result in market share gains for Intel. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We must achieve further market acceptance of our 64 bit technology, AMD64, or we will be materially adversely affected. Our AMD Opteron processors are critical to our strategy of increasing market share in the server category of the microprocessor market. Similarly, our AMD Turion 64 processors are critical to our strategy of increasing 54 Table of Contents market share in the mobile category of the microprocessor market, and particularly the thin and light category. Accordingly, we are making substantial investments in our roadmaps and our platforms for our processors for mobile and server computers. Increasing market acceptance of these processors, our AMD Athlon 64 processors for desktops and the AMD64 technology on which they are based is subject to risks and uncertainties including: the continued support of operating system and application program providers for our 64 bit instruction set, including timely development of 64 bit software applications and applications that can take advantage of the functionality of dual core processors; our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; and the availability, performance and feature set of motherboards, memory and chipsets designed for these processors, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by our customers. If we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, we would be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. We anticipate that under this agreement, from December 25, 2005 through December 25, 2011, we would pay fees to IBM of between $502 million and $562 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 25, 2005, we paid $339 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors at Fab 36 using advanced process technologies. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous 55 Table of Contents new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including our customers; excess production capacity; and substantial declines in average selling prices. For example, in 2001 and 2002 we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. If the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future, we would be materially adversely affected. The demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs, and servers. Industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease. If demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from Intel Corporation, such as Dell, Inc., could further materially adversely affect us. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets. In 2005, sales of our products to high growth markets such as China, Eastern Europe and India increased compared to 2004, and these markets are an important area of future growth for us. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may not grow, and may even decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Intense competition in the microprocessor market could materially adversely affect us. Our principal competitor in the microprocessor market is Intel Corporation. Microprocessor products compete on performance, quality, reliability, cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility, brand recognition and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our manufacturing costs and develop, introduce and sell on a timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices. We depend on third party companies for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intels proprietary bus interface protocol. Accordingly, we depend on third party companies for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards, BIOS software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings. In recent years, many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost 56 Table of Contents significant market share to Intel or exited the business. If we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from these designers and manufacturers, or if suppliers of chipsets cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of chipset products to meet our demand, our business would be materially adversely affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against Intel, our business may be materially adversely affected. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intels Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, which we refer to collectively as Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. Our complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of Intels customers in dealing with AMD. Also, on June 30, 2005, our subsidiary in Japan, AMD Japan K.K., filed an action in Japan against Intel K.K. in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. If our antitrust lawsuits against Intel are ultimately unsuccessful, our business, including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market, could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five OEM and distributor Computation Products customers accounted for a significant percentage of our total net sales in 2005. If one of these customers decided to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for our products, we would be materially adversely affected. If we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted, customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies, such as high performance, low power processors, we could be materially adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse affect on us. There may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on us. 57 Table of Contents In November 2004, we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing whereby Chartered agreed to become an additional manufacturer of our AMD64 based microprocessors. We expect that Chartered will begin production in 2006. The ability of Chartered to begin production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control, including Chartereds ability to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis. In addition, the additional capacity gained through the use of 300 millimeter wafers at Fab 36 plays a fundamental role in our growth plans for the next several years. We plan to add production output at Fab 36 on a year to year basis. If we are not able to achieve our production plans at Fab 36 on a timely basis, we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products. If we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements, we could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. Although we are in the process of qualifying alternate sources, we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for SOI wafers. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us. Industry overcapacity could cause us to under utilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us. Semiconductor companies with their own manufacturing facilities and specialist semiconductor foundries, which are subcontractors that manufacture semiconductors designed by others, have added significant capacity in recent years and we expect them to continue to do so. In the past, capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market, which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us. It is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve, making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity. If our target markets do not grow as we anticipate, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities, which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products whose demand is lower than we anticipate. In addition, during periods of industry overcapacity, customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity, which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements. Many of our costs are fixed. Accordingly, during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand 58 Table of Contents for certain of our products, our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. When this occurs, our operating results are materially adversely affected. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing Fab 36, transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and larger wafers and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities. If the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities. This has in the past had, and in the future may have, a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continually modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, delays in the development of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. Improving our manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to: develop advanced product and process technologies; successfully transition to advanced process technologies; ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities; and achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies. For example, we plan to begin 65 nanometer production by the end of 2006. Our goal is to be substantially converted to 65 nanometer in Fab 36 by mid 2007. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. Our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our microprocessors would be materially adversely affected. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position. Our indebtedness may: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; 59 Table of Contents limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. If we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations. For 2005, our capital expenditures were $1.5 billion which included Spansions capital expenditures through December 20, 2005. For 2006, we plan to make approximately $1.4 billion of capital expenditures. Our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing. Moreover, under the revolving credit agreement among AMD, AMD Fab 36 Holding and AMD Fab 36 KG, we or AMD Fab 36 Holding are required to provide up to $890 million to AMD Fab 36 KG (based on an exchange rate of 0.843 euros to one U.S. dollar as of December 25, 2005). Loans provided to AMD Fab 36 KG under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to AMD Fab 36 KG. Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, in the future. Subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. In particular, AMD Fab 36 KG will have the ability, subject to achieving certain milestones, to borrow up to $831 million (based on an exchange rate of 0.843 euros to one U.S. dollar as of December 25, 2005) from a consortium of banks under its Fab 36 Loan Agreements. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, 60 Table of Contents and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to a failure to meet drawdown conditions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.75% Notes contains various covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; Pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from sales of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy these covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. Moreover, our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us. We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest 61 Table of Contents subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we may be materially adversely affected. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. If one or more of our products were found to be defective after the product had been shipped to customers in volume, the cost of product replacements or product returns would be substantial, and our reputation with our customers would be damaged. In addition, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to fix defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect us. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co source some information technology services. We rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third party in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. 62 Table of Contents Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days or more prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products. Our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. All of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks for use in manufacturing our microprocessors. In addition, we have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales was 79 percent in 2005 and China was one of our largest and fastest growing markets. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; 63 Table of Contents difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in achieving headcount reductions; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health or safety concerns, natural disasters or general economic factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. For example, Chinas economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and the Chinese government introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth. A decline in economic conditions in China could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. The occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, directly or indirectly, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, and our supply chain. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. As a result of our foreign operations, we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 64 Table of Contents Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products, which adversely affects demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner. Foreign laws may provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, we would be materially adversely affected. We are party to intellectual property litigation and may become a party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we have been notified, or third parties may bring actions against us, based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. 65 Table of Contents We are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities. Our operations and properties are subject to various U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Our management systems are designed to maintain compliance. However, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union has enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects semiconductor packaging. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. In addition, future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Our assembly and test facilities are located in China, Malaysia and Singapore. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. 66 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Ownership of Spansion Inc. Common Stock Spansions financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours through December 20, 2005, but as a result of its initial public offering, we currently report our interest in Spansion using the equity method of accounting. We currently own 48,529,403 shares, or approximately 37.9 percent, of Spansions outstanding common stock. As a result, our 37.9 percent share of Spansions net income (loss) will impact our net income (loss). The following risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces could affect Spansions financial position or results of operations and correspondingly our financial position and results of operations. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces. Spansion also faces many of the risks and uncertainties that we face as described above in this Risk Factors section, as well as those set forth in Spansions Registration Statement on Form S 1, as amended, and other SEC filings, to which we refer you. The demand for Spansions products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on Spansions results of operations. Spansion is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones, consumer electronics such as set top boxes and DVD players, automotive electronics, industrial electronics such as networking equipment, and PC peripheral equipment such as printers. Sales of Spansion products also depend on OEMs including increasing amounts of NOR Flash memory content in their products. In 2004 and 2005, demand from the wireless category of the Flash memory market drove a majority of Spansions sales. If demand for these products, or NOR Flash memory content in these products, is below Spansions expectations, or if the functionality of successive generations of these products does not require increasing NOR Flash memory density, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion has lost, and will continue to lose, rights to key intellectual property arrangements once it is no longer a beneficiary of our patent cross license agreements and other licenses, which creates a greatly increased risk of patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against Spansion. As a majority owned subsidiary, Spansion had been the beneficiary of our intellectual property arrangements with third parties, including patent cross license agreements with other major semiconductor companies such as Intel, Motorola and IBM, and licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in Spansions products and software used to operate its business. Following Spansions initial public offering, it was no longer a beneficiary under a number of those agreements. As a result, it lost rights to use important intellectual property that it was previously licensed to use and may therefore be subject to claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of its products and the operation of its business. Therefore, absent negotiating its own license agreements with third parties who own such intellectual property, Spansion will be vulnerable to claims by such parties that its products or operations infringe such parties patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, third parties may have refrained from asserting intellectual property infringement claims against Spansion because it had been a majority owned subsidiary of ours. In addition, we believe that Spansion will lose additional rights under our patent cross license agreements and other licenses once we no longer hold a majority of Spansions shares entitled to vote for the election of Spansions directors, assuming we are still party to such agreements and licenses at such time. The parties to these agreements and licenses, and other third parties with whom we had no prior intellectual property arrangement, may file lawsuits against Spansion seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of Spansions products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of Spansions business as presently conducted. Such litigation could be extremely expensive. The award of material damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction, would have a material adverse effect on Spansion. A lack of market acceptance of MirrorBit technology could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Market acceptance of products based on Spansions MirrorBit technology is a critical factor impacting Spansions ability to increase revenues and market share as well as to enter new markets. MirrorBit technology is 67 Table of Contents a memory cell architecture that enables Flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell. If adoption of Spansions MirrorBit technology occurs at a slower rate than Spansion anticipates, Spansions ability to compete will be reduced, and Spansion would be materially adversely affected. If Spansion does not achieve market acceptance of products incorporating this technology, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion Flash memory products are based on NOR architecture, and a significant market shift to NAND architecture could materially adversely affect Spansion. Flash memory products are generally based either on NOR architecture or NAND architecture. To date, Spansions Flash memory products have been based on NOR architecture, which are typically produced at a higher cost per bit than NAND based products. Spansion does not currently manufacture products based on NAND architecture. From 2003 through 2005, industry sales of NAND based products grew at higher rates than sales of NOR based products, resulting in NAND vendors in aggregate gaining a greater share of the overall Flash memory market and NOR vendors in aggregate losing overall market share. In fact, in 2005, sales of NAND based Flash memory products represented a majority of the Flash memory products sold in the overall Flash memory market. Moreover, the removable storage category of the Flash memory market, which is currently the second largest category after wireless, and is predominantly served by NAND vendors, is expected to be the fastest growing portion of the Flash memory market for the foreseeable future. As mobile phones and other consumer electronics become more advanced, they will require higher density Flash memory to meet the increased data storage requirements associated with music downloads, photos and videos. Because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications, OEMs may increasingly choose NAND based products over NOR based products for their applications. Moreover, some NAND vendors are manufacturing on 300 millimeter wafers or are utilizing more advanced manufacturing process technologies than Spansion is today, which results in an ability to offer products with a lower cost per bit at a given product density. If NAND vendors continue to increase their share of the Flash memory market, Spansions market share may decrease, which would materially adversely affect Spansion. If Spansion fails to successfully develop products based on its new ORNAND architecture, or if there is a lack of market acceptance of products based on its ORNAND architecture, Spansions future operating results would be materially adversely affected. As mobile phones become more advanced, they will require higher density Flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements. Spansion has stated its intention to position itself to address the increasing demand for higher density Flash memory within the wireless category of the Flash memory market by offering products based on its ORNAND architecture, which Spansion has recently introduced. The success of its ORNAND architecture requires that Spansion timely and cost effectively develop, manufacture and market ORNAND based products that are competitive with NAND based Flash memory products in the wireless category of the Flash memory market. If Spansion fails to develop and commercialize its ORNAND architecture on a timely basis or if Spansions ORNAND based products fail to achieve acceptance in the wireless market, Spansions operating results would be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant mobile phone customer may have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Sales of Spansion products are dependent to a large extent on demand for mobile phones. Historically, a small number of customers in the wireless category have driven a substantial portion of net sales. If one of these customers decided to stop buying Spansions products, or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for Spansions products, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. 68 Table of Contents Spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect its financial condition. Spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness may: require Spansion to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; make it difficult for Spansion to satisfy its financial obligations; limit Spansions ability to use its cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; limit Spansions flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and industry; place Spansion at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors; and increase Spansions vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. If Spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow and obtain external financing, it may be unable to make all of its planned capital expenditures. Spansions ability to fund anticipated capital expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Spansions capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on Spansions cash flow and may decrease its cash balances. Spansions inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require it to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. However, if it cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, Spansion may be delayed in achieving such capacity, and Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansions business has been characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods, which can negatively affect Spansions results of operations unless it is able to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices. Average selling prices for Spansions products historically have declined over relatively short time periods. Spansion is unable to predict pricing conditions for future periods. Even in the absence of downturns or oversupply in the industry, average selling prices of Spansions products have decreased during the products lives. When Spansions average selling prices decline, its net sales and net income decline unless it is able to compensate by selling more units, reducing its manufacturing costs or introducing new, higher margin products that have higher densities and or incorporate advanced features. If Spansions average selling prices continue to decline, its operating results could be materially adversely affected. If Spansions cost reduction efforts are not effective, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansion is undertaking a number of actions in an effort to significantly reduce its expenses. These actions include streamlining operations and continuing to align manufacturing utilization to the level of demand for Spansion products, controlling increasing testing costs and working with us and Fujitsu to reduce costs under services agreements. We cannot assure you that any of these actions will occur as anticipated or at all, or that Spansion will be able to achieve significant cost reductions. If Spansions cost reduction efforts are unsuccessful, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse affect on Spansion. There may be situations in which Spansions manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of Spansions products. Spansions inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in its own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material 69 Table of Contents adverse effect on Spansion. For example, in the first half of 2004, Spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of its lower density embedded Flash memory products because in 2003 it underestimated demand for these products, and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis. Spansion has stated its belief that this adversely impacted its relationships with customers who received reduced allocations, or did not receive allocations, of its embedded products, and Spansion has stated its belief that its competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share. More recently, in the third quarter of 2005, Spansion experienced capacity constraints for final test and assembly of certain products. While Spansion is working internally and with subcontractors to realign and increase capacity to meet anticipated demand, Spansion does not expect to be able to do so in the short term. These capacity constraints limit Spansions ability to respond to rapid and short term surges in demand for its products. Spansions inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in its own facility or through foundry, subcontractor or similar arrangements with third parties, could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Spansion is party to intellectual property litigation and may become party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products. Tessera, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Spansion alleging that it has infringed certain of Tesseras patents. Tessera has sought to enjoin such alleged infringement and to recover an unspecified amount of damages. In addition, Fujitsu has informed Spansion that it has been informed by Texas Instruments that Texas Instruments believes that several of Spansions products infringe some of Texas Instruments patents. Fujitsu has also informed Spansion that it expects Spansion to defend and indemnify Fujitsu against Texas Instruments claims in accordance with the terms of Spansions distribution agreement with Fujitsu. Defending these claims and similar claims could be extremely expensive and time consuming for Spansion, and defending these claims or others or the award of damages or an injunction could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Intense competition in the Flash memory market could materially adversely affect Spansion. Spansions principal competitors in the Flash memory market are Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., Macronix International Co., Ltd., Toshiba Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corp. and Renesas Technology Corp. and may also include the joint venture between Intel and Micron Technology, Inc. The principal bases of competition in the Flash memory market are cost, selling price, performance, quality and customer relationships. In particular, in the past, Spansions competitors have aggressively priced their products in order to increase market share, which resulted in decreased average selling prices for Spansions products and adversely impacted Spansions results of operations. In addition, recent capital investments by competitors have resulted in substantial industry manufacturing capacity, which may further contribute to a competitive pricing environment. Also, Spansion and certain of its competitors have licensed Flash memory technology called NROM technology from a third party. NROM technology has similar characteristics to Spansions MirrorBit technology which may allow these competitors to develop new Flash memory technology that is competitive with Spansions MirrorBit technology. Spansion may not be able to compete effectively if it fails to reduce its manufacturing costs and develop, introduce and sell on a timely basis, new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices. If Spansion is unable to timely and efficiently implement 300 millimeter wafer capacity for the manufacture of its Flash memory products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansion has stated its intention to develop manufacturing capacity on 300 millimeter wafers for its Flash memory products. The timing for implementing 300 millimeter capacity will depend in part on the demand for 70 Table of Contents Spansions Flash memory products and the ability to fund the construction of such a facility if Spansion chooses to develop capacity internally. If Spansion is delayed in having this capacity or is unable to timely and efficiently ramp production on 300 millimeter wafers, Spansion would not achieve anticipated cost savings and capacity associated with this technology, and Spansion could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture Spansions products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansions manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to Spansion or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that Spansion purchases is complex, it is difficult for it to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials Spansion uses in manufacturing its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, Spansion purchases commercial memory die, such as SRAM, pSRAM, 1pSDRAM and NAND from third party suppliers and incorporates these die into its multi chip package products. Spansions production of Flash memory products was constrained in the first half of 2004 because of difficulties in procuring adequate supply of pSRAM. Some of Spansions major suppliers, including Samsung, are also its competitors in the Flash memory market. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If Spansion is unable to procure certain of these materials, Spansion may have to reduce its manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on Spansion. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares for an extended period of time, then our results of operations may be adversely affected. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares and the decline in the market value level is deemed other than temporary, then we may be required to take an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the book value and the market value. For the quarter in which we took any such impairment charge, our results of operations could be adversely affected by the amount of such impairment charge. In addition, the carrying value of our investment in Spansion on our balance sheet would also be reduced. Therefore, sustained decreases in the market price of Spansions common stock could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In order to reduce this interest rate risk, we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities. As of December 25, 2005, substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes, short term corporate notes, short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes. The majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term. We continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate. We do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. 71 Table of Contents On December 21, 2005, Spansion LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spansion Inc., issued to us $175 million aggregate principal amount of the Spansion Senior Notes. We purchased the Spansion Senior Notes for approximately $158.9 million in cash, at 90.828 percent of face value. The Spansion Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Spansion LLC and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of Spansion Inc, or Spansion LLC. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year beginning April 15, 2006 until the maturity date of April 15, 2016. Spansion LLCs obligations under the Spansion Senior Notes are guaranteed by Spansion Inc., Spansion Technology Inc., a subsidiary of Spansion Inc., and any restricted subsidiary of Spansion that guarantees any of Spansions public debt in the future. Because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction, and we intend to sell them in 2006, we classified these notes as short term investments. The Spansion Senior Notes are not investment grade, and represent an exception to the general policy set forth above. We use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital needs. The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 25, 2005 and comparable fair values as of December 26, 2004: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal2007 Fiscal2008 Fiscal2009 Fiscal2010 Thereafter Total Fiscal2005 FairValue Fiscal2004 FairValue (In thousands except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 488,080 $ $ $ $ $ $ 488,080 $ 488,080 $ 511,566 Weighted average rate 3.68 % 3.68 % 3.68 % 2.19 % Variable rate amounts $ 50,023 $ $ $ $ $ $ 50,023 $ 50,023 $ 281,000 Weighted average rate 4.21 % 4.21 % 4.21 % 2.21 % Short term investments: Fixed rate amounts $ 779,092 $ $ $ $ $ 158,957 $ 938,049 $ 938,049 $ 2,557 Weighted average rate 4.50 % 14.23 % 6.15 % 6.15 % 2.50 % Variable rate amounts $ 223,650 $ $ $ $ $ $ 223,650 $ 223,650 $ 274,625 Weighted average rate 4.31 % 4.31 % 4.31 % 2.35 % Long term investments: Equity investments $ $ $ $ $ $ 3,942 $ 3,942 $ 6,544 $ 6,653 Fixed rate amounts $ 13,344 $ $ $ $ $ $ 13,344 $ 13,344 $ 13,676 Weighted average rate 3.86 % 3.86 % 3.86 % 2.26 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,554,189 $ $ $ $ $ 162,899 $ 1,717,088 $ 1,719,690 $ 1,090,077 Debt Obligations Debt fixed rate amounts $ 39,506 $ 39,507 $ 39,507 $ 38,235 $ $ 1,100,000 $ 1,256,755 $ 1,410,407 $ 1,927,626 Weighted average rate 10.80 % 10.80 % 10.80 % 10.97 % 6.39 % 6.94 % 6.94 % 6.51 % Debt variable rate amounts $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 244,487 Weighted average rate 3.55 % Capital leases $ 3,718 $ 4,193 $ 4,686 $ 5,082 $ 5,784 $ 90,071 $ 113,534 $ 113,534 $ 183,406 Weighted average rate 7.47 % 7.53 % 7.66 % 8.03 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 7.95 % 7.95 % 4.40 % Total Debt Obligations $ 43,224 $ 43,700 $ 44,193 $ 43,317 $ 5,784 $ 1,190,071 $ 1,370,289 $ 1,523,941 $ 2,355,519 Foreign Exchange Risk. As of December 25, 2005, as a result of our foreign operations, we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our profitability and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward and option 72 Table of Contents contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions. Our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 25, 2005, we had an aggregate of $566 million (notional amount) of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro outstanding. Commencing from December 26, 2005, we changed the functional currency for our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, from 2006 and for the foreseeable future, all of our subsidiaries will use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. The change in the functional currency of these subsidiaries is in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency Translation, (SFAS 52) and reflects the changed economic facts and circumstances pertaining to these subsidiaries. Under the requirements of SFAS 52, we assessed the various economic factors relating to AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG and concluded that due to changes in facts, circumstances, scope of operations and business practices, the U.S. dollar is now the currency of the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate. However, locally incurred expenses of these subsidiaries will continue to be denominated in euro, and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations would cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales, thereby adversely affecting our profitability and cash flow. We will continue to monitor and to hedge this foreign risk exposure. In addition, as a result of the Spansion IPO, as of December 21, 2005, we no longer have any foreign exchange risk related to Japanese yen, and approximately $370 million of Spansions debt to third parties, which was mostly variable rate, was deconsolidated from our financial position. During the time that Spansions results of operations were consolidated with our results of operations, we had sales, costs, assets and liabilities that were denominated in Japanese yen. For example, sales of Spansion Flash memory products in Japan were denominated in yen and certain manufacturing costs related to Spansion Flash memory products were denominated in yen. Unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended December 25, 2005 were not material. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future. However, we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately. In particular, generally, we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure. Moreover, we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004. All of our foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts mature within the next 12 months.
