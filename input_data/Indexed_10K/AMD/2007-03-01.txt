Our Industry Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the 2 Table of Contents invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function. In order to satisfy the demand for faster, smaller and lower cost ICs, semiconductor manufacturers have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology. ICs are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers. Use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis. Use of larger wafers can contribute further to a decrease in manufacturing costs per unit and to an increase in capacity by yielding more chips per wafer. The availability of low cost semiconductors, together with increased customer demand for sophisticated electronic systems, has led to the proliferation of semiconductors. Today, virtually all electronic products use semiconductors, including PCs and related peripherals, wired and wireless voice and data communications and networking products including mobile telephones, facsimile and photocopy machines, home entertainment equipment, industrial control equipment and automobiles. During most of 2006, within the global semiconductor industry, we offered primarily: x86 microprocessors for the commercial and consumer markets, which are used for control and computing tasks; and embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets. As a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, we began to supply 3D graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations, and servers as well as products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles. Therefore, since this acquisition, we have actively participated in the semiconductor graphics and chipset markets as well as in the semiconductor market for consumer electronics devices. Computation Products The x86 Microprocessor Market A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer. It generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal indicators of CPU performance are work per cycle, or how many instructions are executed per cycle, clock speed, representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of hertz, or cycles per second, and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of CPUs, or cores, on a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed. Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. For approximately the last ten years, microprocessors have had 32 bit computing capabilities. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. While 32 bit processors have historically been sufficient, we believe that they will face increasing challenges as new data and memory intensive consumer and enterprise software applications gain popularity. Microprocessors with 64 bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory. Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the exponential growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor manufacturers have transitioned from manufacturing single core microprocessors to also manufacturing multi core processors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi core 3 Table of Contents processors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Moreover, two or more processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of symmetrical multiprocessing is effective in both multi tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for multi threaded software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or threads, simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership. With the recent release of Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista and with the proliferation of applications for multimedia and gaming, grid computing and extensive enterprise databases, we believe the demand for 64 bit computing, multi core technology and improved power management technology will continue to increase. Microprocessor Products We currently offer single core and dual core microprocessor products for servers, workstations, notebooks and desktop PCs. Our microprocessors currently are designed with both 32 bit and 64 bit processing capabilities. We based our microprocessors on the x86 instruction set architecture and most of these processors are also based on the AMD64 technology platform with direct connect architecture. Direct connect architecture connects an on chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. For dual core processors, we integrate two processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die. We believe this architecture, and, in particular, the integrated memory controller, enables substantially higher performance because memory can be accessed more directly rather than traversing a traditional front side bus, which results in increased bandwidth and reduced memory latencies. Our processors support HyperTransport technology, which is a high bandwidth communications interface we initially developed that enables substantially higher performance and supports our I/O virtualization technology. In designing our processors, we also focus on continuously improving power management technology, or performance per watt. To that end, we offer processors that feature AMD PowerNow! technology, which we designed to reduce system level energy consumption, with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that can significantly reduce processor power consumption during idle times. We design our microprocessors to be compatible with operating system software such as the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, Linux&reg;, NetWare&reg;, Solaris and UNIX. We also designed the AMD64 architecture to enhance the security of a users computing environment by integrating security features that are designed to prevent the spread of certain viruses when enabled by the anti virus features of current versions of certain operating systems, including Linux, the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems and Solaris operating systems. Servers and Workstations. Our microprocessors for servers and workstations consist primarily of our single core and dual core AMD Opteron processors. A server is a powerful computer on a network, often with multiple microprocessors working together, that is dedicated to a particular purpose, stores large amounts of information and performs the critical functions for that purpose. A workstation is essentially a heavy duty desktop, designed for tasks such as computer aided design and digital content creation. We based our AMD Opteron processors for servers and workstations on the AMD64 technology platform, which extends the industry standard x86 instruction set architecture to 64 bit computing, and designed them to allow simultaneous 32 bit and 64 bit computing. These processors can be used in a variety of server applications, including business processing (enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and supply chain management) and business intelligence. They can also be used in workstation applications such as engineering and digital content creation software and other information technology infrastructure applications such as intensive Web serving and messaging. 4 Table of Contents Our dual core AMD Opteron processors offer improved overall performance on many applications compared to single core AMD processors by executing more operations simultaneously during each clock cycle, and improved performance per watt, which can reduce the operational costs related to power usage. At the same time, servers based on dual core AMD Opteron processors are easier to manage because more processing capacity can be concentrated into fewer servers. For the same reason, servers based on dual core processors are less costly to operate. Dual core AMD Opteron processors also allow our enterprise customers to more easily implement virtualization across their business. Virtualization is the use of software to allow workloads to be shared at the processor level by providing the illusion of multiple processors. Virtualization enables running different operating systems and applications on the same server, thereby consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements. In August 2006 we introduced a new generation of AMD Opteron dual core processors. These processors provide several new features including improved virtualization support and energy efficient DDR2 memory. In addition, these processors can be replaced by AMD quad core processors in the same socket and thermal envelope. Our quad core x86 processors for servers, which we expect to begin shipping in mid 2007, will incorporate four processor cores on a single die of silicon. DDR2, or double data rate two, is a type of random access memory technology used for high speed storage of the working data of a computer. Notebook PCs. Our microprocessors for notebook PCs consist primarily of AMD Turion 64 processors and mobile AMD Sempron processors. We designed our mobile processor products for high performance, longer battery life and wireless connectivity. AMD Turion 64 processors represent our most advanced family of Windows compatible processors for thinner and lighter notebook PCs, and provide performance improvements such as longer battery life, reduced heat generation, enhanced security and compatibility with current wireless and graphics solutions. In May 2006 we introduced AMD Turion 64 X2 dual core mobile technology, which is our most advanced dual core processor family for notebook PCs. We designed this technology to enable leading edge graphics for the more visual experience provided by the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista operating system, longer battery life, enhanced security and compatibility with the latest wireless technologies. In addition, we have designed the process used to manufacture AMD Turion 64 mobile technology for more thermally efficient processor operation and reduced power consumption. Desktop PCs. Our microprocessors for desktop PCs consist primarily of the following tiered product brands: AMD Athlon 64 FX, AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Sempron processors. We designed the AMD Athlon 64 FX processor specifically for gamers, PC enthusiasts and digital content creators who require processors that can perform graphic intensive tasks. We designed our AMD Athlon 64 processors for enterprises and sophisticated PC users that seek to access large amounts of data and memory. For value conscious consumers of desktop and notebook PCs, we offer the AMD Sempron microprocessor, which we designed to provide core computing needs at affordable prices. We also offer AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors and AMD Athlon 64 FX X2 dual core processors, which like the dual core AMD Opteron processors, contain two processor cores on one semiconductor die. The performance advantages of AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously. For example, users are able to simultaneously download audio files such as MP3s, record to digital media devices, check and write email, edit a digital photo and run virus protection without compromising the performance of their PC. AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors also have an integrated DDR2 memory controller, which is designed to increase performance on memory intensive applications. We designed the AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors for prosumer and digital media enthusiasts or other users who routinely run multiple processor intensive software applications simultaneously. In December 2006, we introduced a new generation of AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors which are manufactured using 65 nanometer technology. We designed these processors to deliver improved 5 Table of Contents performance per watt by maintaining the performance of the previous generation of AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core processors and reducing power consumption. To aid in reducing power consumption, these new processors incorporate a feature called C1 Enhanced, a power management feature that slows selected system functions when not in use to reduce overall power consumption. On October 25, 2006, we completed our acquisition of ATI. We believe that the acquisition of ATI will allow us to deliver products that better fulfill the increasing demand for more integrated computing solutions. We plan to deliver a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also plan to develop and offer monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors. We refer to these design initiatives as Fusion. At the same time, we plan to continue to develop discrete microprocessor and graphics processor products and to maintain open interface and software standards in order to allow our customers to choose the combination of technologies that best serve their needs. Embedded Products The Embedded Processor Market During 2006, we offered embedded microprocessors for high end commercial markets, commercial client markets and certain consumer markets. The high end commercial markets that we address include communication servers, networking equipment, storage servers, and imaging systems. The applications in these markets typically require high performance, enterprise class products that include embedded server class products. Customers use commercial client products to address specialized needs within a variety of industries, including computer devices such as thin clients, single board computers, blade PCs, points of sale terminals, commercial value clients, and access devices such as gateways and access points. Devices for specific consumer markets are used in ultra mobile PCs, ultra value clients and entertainment devices such as media players and set top boxes. The applications in these devices typically require highly integrated systems on chip, or SoCs, that include high performance, low power embedded processors and microcontrollers. Embedded Processors Our products range from low power x86 architecture based embedded processors to high performance, enterprise class, harsh environment capable x86 architecture based products. We design embedded connectivity devices to address customer needs in non PC markets where low power, Internet connectivity and or low power processing is a priority. Typically these embedded processors are used in products that require high to moderate levels of performance where key features include low cost, mobility, low power and small form factor. We target some products that use our embedded processors for specific markets using SoC design techniques. Our embedded microprocessor products include the AMD Geode product family. AMD Geode microprocessors are 32 bit processors based on the x86 instruction set architecture. These processors integrate functionality such as processing, system logic, graphics, audio and video decompression onto one integrated device. We also offer embedded processors based on AMD64 technology, which consists of low power versions of our AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, AMD Sempron and AMD Opteron families of products. These low power products deliver the same performance as their corresponding full power parts while offering the added benefit of reduced power consumption and thermal output. These processors are configured specifically for demanding embedded applications traditionally served by custom silicon designs. We believe these processors also offer our customers the ability to leverage the AMD64 infrastructure. In addition, a distinguishing characteristic of our AMD64 based embedded processors is our AMD64 Longevity Program. The AMD64 Longevity Program offers a select set of AMD64 processors with an extended standard availability period of five years. The extended availability period addresses the requirements of customers designing products for network, storage, blade and 6 Table of Contents telecommunications servers; digital imaging; and military and industrial controls systems. Such markets have lengthy design and qualification cycles and longer life spans in the marketplace than typical mainstream computing products. Prior to July 2006, we also provided MIPS&reg; architecture based Alchemy embedded processors. In July 2006 we sold the Alchemy family of products to Raza Microelectronics, Inc. Our embedded processor products, from AMD Opteron to AMD Geode, exemplify our x86 Everywhere microprocessor strategy, which is our goal for utilizing the x86 instruction set architecture to power a wide variety of devices in diverse places such as the home, office or car, in the supply chain, in storage networks, in the data center, and or in global communications networks. We believe that when a greater number of devices are standardized with an x86 based platform, end users can benefit from the ability to run their existing x86 based software on devices that interoperate with each other. This can accelerate and simplify the process of enabling faster, easier connectivity and data sharing between a wide range of products, from portable consumer electronics to PCs and servers. With our full range of embedded microprocessors, we are able to extend our x86 based product offerings to serve markets from embedded appliances to embedded server class products. Graphics and Chipset Products Graphics and Chipset Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual processing in various computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop and notebook PCs, workstations and game consoles. The strength of the semiconductor graphics market is heavily dependent upon the market for PCs. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. PC users value a rich visual experience, particularly in the high end enthusiast market where consumers seek out the fastest and highest performing visual processing products to deliver the most compelling and immersive gaming experiences. Moreover, for some consumers, the PC market is evolving from a traditional data and communications processing machine to an entertainment platform. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing intensive multimedia content for PCs and PC manufacturers creating more PCs designed for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content. In turn, the trend has contributed to the development of higher performance graphics solutions. For example, we believe that the enhanced 3D graphics capabilities enabled by Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista and the increasing availability of media center PCs will spur development of advanced graphics applications intended for mainstream users, which will contribute to increased demand for graphics and chipset products. The primary product of a semiconductor graphics supplier is the graphics processing unit, or GPU, a semiconductor chip that increases the speed and complexity of images that can be displayed on a graphical interface and improves image resolution and color definition. The GPU off loads the burden of graphics processing from the CPU. In this way, a dedicated graphics processor and CPU work in tandem to increase overall speed and performance of the system. A graphics solution can be in the form of either a stand alone graphics chip or an integrated chipset solution. Recently, to further improve graphics processing performance, semiconductor graphics suppliers have introduced multi GPU technologies which increase graphics processing speed by dividing graphics rendering and display among two or more graphics processors. Graphics and Chipset Products We provide our graphics solution for both desktop and notebook PCs by adding either one or more discrete graphics processors, which are stand alone graphics chips, or by integrating the graphics hardware into the motherboard chipset. Discrete graphics chips tend to provide higher levels of performance and speed, while integrated chipsets generally offer a lower cost solution, improved power consumption and smaller form factors. The demand for integrated graphics solutions has grown in recent years as the performance of integrated chipsets has advanced. Also, customers of graphics products such as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and PC system integrators, or SIs, who are continually pressured to meet lower price and power consumption targets 7 Table of Contents while still maintaining reasonable profit margins, are increasingly using integrated chipsets over discrete graphics chips in their products because of the lower cost of integrated graphics solutions. Our customers generally use our graphics and chipset products to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution and color attributes. Our products include 3D graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets developed for use in desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers. With each of our graphics products, we provide drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. Our latest generation of graphics, chipset and related software offer full support for the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista operating system. In addition to the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, our graphics products support Apples Mac OS X as well as Linux&reg; based applications. Discrete Desktop Products. Our discrete GPUs for desktop PCs include our ATI Radeon X1000 family of products which we introduced in October 2005. From our current enthusiast level product, the ATI Radeon X1950 to the value based ATI Radeon X1300, this product family includes offerings that incorporate features and price performance characteristics for the enthusiast, performance, mainstream and value categories of the desktop PC market. These products support our CrossFire dual GPU technology, first introduced in May 2005. Crossfire technology increases graphics processing power and speed by combining two GPUs in the same PC platform. The ATI Radeon X1000 family of products incorporates our proprietary ATI Avivo platform technology. ATI Avivo technology is a video and display platform that enables high definition (HD) video playback and display. Although an increasing percentage of desktop PCs rely on integrated chipsets for graphics, we believe that discrete graphic solutions will continue to offer higher performance and be the preferred solution for several types of desktop PC configurations, such as platforms designed for gaming enthusiasts, CAD professionals and animation as well as for applications such as multimedia, photo and video editing, and other graphic intensive applications. Discrete Notebook Products. Our discrete GPUs for the notebook PC market include our ATI Mobility Radeon X1000 series of products which we introduced in December 2005. When selecting a graphics solution, the key considerations for notebook PC manufacturers are visual performance, power consumption, form factor and cost. We designed our products to provide the mix of performance, features and flexibility desired by the major categories of the notebook PC market, including the thin and light, performance, desktop replacement and value categories. Our high end ATI Mobility Radeon X1900 products deliver 3D graphics performance and video playback quality and vibrant image quality for performance notebook PCs. An ultra threaded 3D architecture with advanced power management provides high definition video and display enhancements. At the value end, we offer the ATI Mobility Radeon X1300 with features such as enhanced 3D gaming, high quality video playback and longer battery life for price conscious consumers. Chipset Products. Our integrated chipset solutions, also known as core logic on the motherboard, include our Radeon Xpress and Crossfire families. We target our Radeon Xpress series chipsets to motherboard manufacturers and offer a high degree of performance, stability and connectivity for mainstream and commercial desktop and notebook PCs. Radeon Xpress chipsets contain integrated graphics while our Crossfire chipsets are discrete chipsets without integrated graphics and are intended to be used in systems targeting the higher end markets, such as gaming, that use multiple add in graphics boards. Our chipset solutions include products that are compatible with Intel platforms. We expect to continue to ship existing chipsets for Intel CPUs throughout 2007 and beyond to the extent there is demand for these products. However, we expect that sales of these products will continue to decline and will eventually cease. Home Media PC Products. Our home media PC products incorporate a wide variety of features for consumers that intend to use their PCs for multimedia applications. For example, our family of TV Wonder 8 Table of Contents products allows consumers to watch and record TV on their PC, listen to FM radio stations and watch DVD movies. Our latest generation of these products also incorporates our ATI Avivo technology which enables PCs to record and playback in HD. Workstation and Server Products. Our products for the professional workstation market consist of our FireGL and FireMV product families.

We also provide products for the server market, where we leverage our graphics expertise and align our offerings to provide stability, video quality and bus architectures that our server customers desire. Consumer Electronics Products Consumer Electronics Market The semiconductor market for video, graphics and media processors in consumer electronics products addresses the need for enhancing the visual experience provided by devices such as mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles. Consumers value entertainment and communications products that can deliver an engaging multimedia experience. Accordingly, semiconductor suppliers of video, graphics and media processors strive to deliver products that improve visual realism and allow manufacturers of mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles the opportunity to differentiate their products. Handheld Market. In recent years, mobile phones have transitioned towards color displays with higher resolutions that deliver a variety of multimedia features. Manufacturers are offering functionality such as built in digital cameras and camcorders, MP3 audio playback, video playback, mobile TV reception and 3D gaming in an increasing percentage of mobile phones, thereby increasing the opportunity to supply media processors to mobile phone manufacturers. Digital TV Market. The market for digital TVs is growing, driven in part by the transition of terrestrial broadcast television transmissions from analog to digital in many different regions throughout the world. For example, on February 18, 2009, full power television stations in the United States will stop analog broadcasting and transition to digital broadcasting. This conversion is supported by a U.S. Federal Communications Commission mandate that requires electronics manufacturers to include digital tuners in all new television sets by March 2007. There is also a worldwide shift in the television industry from analog cathode ray tube, or CRT, displays to digital flat panel displays such as LCD and plasma. These flat panel displays are able to support larger screen sizes and higher resolutions. Producing the highest quality images on these advanced televisions is fundamental to television manufacturers. Semiconductor graphics solutions play an integral role in improving video image quality to enhance the user viewing experience. Game Consoles. Semiconductor graphics suppliers have leveraged their core visual and graphics processing technologies developed for the PC market by providing solutions to game console manufacturers. In this market, semiconductor graphics suppliers work alongside game console manufacturers to enhance the visual experience for users of sophisticated video games. Consumer Electronics Products We continue to leverage our core technology, visual processing expertise and power management know how to meet the needs of certain consumer electronics markets. We have initially targeted three categories of the consumer electronics market: (i) handheld devices, including mobile phones; (ii) digital TVs; and (iii) game consoles. 9 Table of Contents Our products for consumer electronics devices include media processors used in handheld devices such as mobile phones and video processors used in digital TVs. We also receive royalties from game console manufacturers in connection with sales of systems that incorporate our graphics intellectual property and designs.

The latest generation of handheld devices, particularly mobile phones, are driving demand for more advanced multimedia processors. Higher resolution displays, higher performing embedded processors, increased internal and removable storage, mobile email and PDA like features as well as multimedia functionality such as built in digital cameras, MP3 audio playback, video playback, mobile TV and 3D gaming are all contributing to rapid changes in handheld and mobile communication devices. Our AMD Imageon product line provides visual processing, high quality audio and power saving technologies. We offer products for each category of the mobile phone media processor market: entry level, feature phones, performance phones and fully loaded multimedia and gaming phones. The AMD Imageon video engine enables a mobile digital camcorder/player and supports advanced features such as video telephony and video streaming. We also provide AMD Imageon products that include a programmable audio engine that enables features such as positional 3D sound, CD quality ring tones and music phones with high quality stereo recording and playback. Digital TVs. As television broadcasters in North America and other parts of the world transition their analog television signals to digital transmissions, we believe increased consumer interest in digital TV will spur demand for more advanced systems. Digital transmission standards provide significant advantages compared to analog standards, including greater picture clarity and resolution as well as opportunities for more channels, e commerce and enhanced TV viewing. We offer two groups of products that target two major silicon blocks inside an integrated digital TV: the digital video receiver and the decoder. An integrated digital TV is one where a digital receiver and digital video decoder are integrated inside the TV rather than externally, such as via a set top box. Our AMD Xilleon and Theater product lines are used in integrated digital TVs to demodulate and decode digital broadcast signals. AMD Xilleon products also provide video, graphics and audio processing. The drivers and supporting software that we provide with our digital TV products allow deployment in multiple worldwide markets with either customer designed applications or AMD supplied Customer Application Ready Design (CARD) software applications. In September 2006, we announced the AMD Xilleon&reg; 260, an SoC product that supports full high definition for worldwide digital TV standards including Europe, Japan, Korea and North America. The AMD Xilleon 260 includes a powerful video pipeline for both standard definition and HD content. Advanced features which enhance image quality include HD de interlacing, a 3D comb filter, dynamic contrast, noise reduction, sharpness, and color control. Game Consoles.

ODMs provide design and or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers. 11 Table of Contents Customers of our graphics and chipset products consist primarily of: PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers who build GPUs into their PC motherboard and graphics board products, add in board, or AIB, manufacturers who incorporate GPUs into their graphics board products, SIs, who build GPUs into their PC products, third party distributors, retail stores and e commerce retailers. Customers of our products for consumer electronic devices consist primarily of OEMs and ODMs. Our sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet the needs of our customers. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products in order to assist in optimizing product compatibility. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEMs: multi nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi nationals and regional accounts are our core OEM customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktop and notebook PCs, PC motherboards and consumer electronics products such as mobile phones and digital TVs. Under our standard terms and conditions, OEMs do not have a right to return our products other than pursuant to the standard limited warranty. However, from time to time we may agree to repurchase a portion of some categories of products pursuant to negotiated terms. In 2006, Hewlett Packard Company accounted for greater than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues. Sales to Hewlett Packard consisted primarily of products from our Computation Products segment. In addition, one handset manufacturer accounted for more than half of the revenue attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment and one game console provider accounted for a significant portion of revenue attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment. Moreover, two customers accounted for approximately one third of the revenue attributable to our Graphics and Chipsets segment. A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Third Party Distributors Our authorized distributors resell to sub distributors and mid sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. In 2006, Avnet, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies accounted for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net revenue. Avnet is a distributor of our products and sales to Avnet consisted primarily of products, from our Computation Products segment. AIB Manufacturers and System Integrators We strive to establish and broaden our relationships with AIB manufacturers. We offer component level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board level products using our technology to SIs and at retail. We also work directly with our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. 12 Table of Contents Competition Generally, the IC industry is intensely competitive. Products typically compete on product quality, power consumption, reliability, speed, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our manufacturing costs. Competition in the Microprocessor Market Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels market power and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating, and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue. Competition in the Embedded Processor Market With respect to our embedded processors for personal connectivity devices, our principal competitors are Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Hitachi, Ltd., Intel Corporation, NEC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation and Via Technologies, Inc. We expect competition in the market for these devices to increase as our principal competitors focus more resources on developing low power embedded processor solutions. 13 Table of Contents Competition in the Graphics and Chipset Market In the graphics and chipset market, our competitors include discrete graphics suppliers and suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. A recent trend in the graphics processing market is that PC manufacturers are increasingly choosing to use integrated chipsets, particularly for notebook computers, over discrete GPUs because integrated chipsets cost significantly less than discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market. It is possible that Intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets, which could shrink the total available market for certain of our discrete GPUs, that Intel could re enter the discrete GPU market, or that Intel will take other actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as designing a proprietary graphics interface. Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs. However, we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market. Competition in the Consumer Electronics Market In the semiconductor market for consumer electronics products we have different competitors in each of our product categories. With respect to our products for handheld devices, we have three primary categories of competitors: vendors of baseband processors, vendors of applications processors and vendors of media co processors. The baseband processor provides the basic voice and communication processing functionality in mobile phones. For certain value categories of the market, baseband processor vendors are integrating the multimedia processing required for feature rich mobile phones. Baseband processor vendors incorporating this basic level of graphics processing include Analog Devices, Inc., Agere Systems Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Koninklijke Phillips Electronics N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated and Texas Instruments Incorporated. Another category of competitor, application processor vendors, target manufacturer of high end feature and smart phones whose products require large amounts of general purpose processing capability as well as multimedia processing. These vendors include Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Nvidia Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics N.V. and Texas Instruments Incorporated. The third category of competitor provides dedicated processors to drive a high level of multimedia functionality. This approach is most comparable to our strategy, and our competitors in this category include Core Logic Incorporated, Epson Corp., MTEK Vision Co. Ltd., Nvidia Corporation and Renesas Technology Corp. With respect to our products for digital TVs, our primary competitors include Broadcom Corporation, Genesis Microchip Inc., MediaTek Inc., NEC Corporation, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics N.V., Trident Microsystems Inc. and Zoran Corporation, as well as in house semiconductor development divisions at companies such as LG Electronics, Inc., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (a brand of Panasonic Electronic Devices Co., Ltd.), Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation. In the game console category, we compete primarily against Nvidia. Other competitors include Intel and IBM. Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance per watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product 14 Table of Contents design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies and plan to do so in the future. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. With respect to graphics and chipsets and products for consumer electronics devices, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever changing demands of the PC and consumer electronics industries on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors. Our research and development expenses for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $1,205 million, $1,144 million and $934 million. Research and development expenses for 2006 included ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. For more information, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Penang, Taiwan and India. In August 2006 we announced the opening of a new research and development facility in Shanghai, China. Also, in September 2006 we announced the opening of a new advanced microprocessor development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. We conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this agreement, we jointly develop new process technologies, including 45 nanometer, 32 nanometer, 22 nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also includes laboratory based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die to package connection technologies. We pay fees to IBM for joint development projects. The actual amounts we pay to IBM are dependent upon the number of partners, including us and IBM, engaged in related development projects under the agreement. In addition, we agreed to pay IBM specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. For more information on the fees paid or payable to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees Unconditional Purchase Commitments, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. Under the agreement, our joint development relationship continues through December 31, 2011. However, the continuation of capital purchases by IBM necessary for process development projects under the agreement past December 31, 2008 is conditioned upon the approval of IBMs board of directors. If IBMs board of directors does not approve our agreement by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. In addition, our agreement with IBM may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under our agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300 millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y. We conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, 15 Table of Contents Canada, India, Finland and China. Due to the rapid pace of technological change in the graphics industry, our strategy is to focus on developing the newest generation of products that meet market and customer requirements on a timely basis so as to meet each market window. Manufacturing, Assembly and Test Facilities We own and operate five manufacturing facilities, of which two are microprocessor wafer fabrication facilities and three are microprocessor assembly and test facilities. We developed an approach to manufacturing called Automated Precision Manufacturing, or APM. APM comprises a suite of automation, optimization and real time data analysis technologies which automate the way decisions are made within our fabrication facilities. We use APM during process technology transitions, and believe APM enables greater efficiency, higher baseline yields, better binning and faster yield learning. Our microprocessor manufacturing is conducted at the facilities described in the chart below. These facilities are the cornerstone of our flexible capacity growth plan, which focuses on bringing the right amount of capacity online at the right time through ongoing, incremental increases in total output. Facility Location Wafer Size(diameter inmillimeters) PrincipalProductionTechnology(in nanometers) ApproximateClean RoomSquareFootage Dresden, Germany Fab 30 200 90 150,000 Fab 36 300 90/65 140,000 During 2006, we manufactured our microprocessor products at Fab 30 and Fab 36 primarily on 90 nanometer process technology. In December 2006, we began manufacturing using 65 nanometer technology at Fab 36. Our goal is to have substantially all of the wafers out of Fab 36 being manufactured on 65 nanometer technology by mid 2007 and to begin manufacturing using 45 nanometer technology in mid 2008. In May 2006, we announced plans to significantly expand our 300 millimeter manufacturing capacity in Dresden, Germany. The expansion includes the conversion of Fab 30 from manufacturing on 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers, capacity expansion in Fab 36, and the addition of a new facility to support bump and test activities. Bump and test is the final stage of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test. We anticipate that after being converted to a 300 millimeters facility, Fab 30 will be able to handle approximately up to 20,000 300 millimeter wafer starts per month. We intend to begin to decrease 200 millimeter production at Fab 30 in mid 2007, and to bring up 300 millimeter production in early 2008. Use of 300 millimeter wafers can contribute to decreasing manufacturing costs per unit and helps increase capacity by yielding significantly more chips per wafer than 200 millimeter wafers. Use of smaller process geometries allows us to put more transistors on an equivalent size chip, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and or cost less to manufacture. Another facet of our flexible capacity growth strategy involves working with third party foundries, and to this end, we have sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing pursuant to which Chartered is an additional manufacturing source for our AMD64 based microprocessors. In June 2006, we began our first revenue shipments of microprocessors manufactured at Chartered. We also have foundry arrangements with third parties for the production of our embedded processors, graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices. In anticipation of the potential need for increased manufacturing capacity over the longer term, on December 22, 2006, we entered into a Grant Disbursement Agreement with the New York State Urban 16 Table of Contents Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation, or ESDC, in connection with a potential new 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York. Under the agreement, AMD would be able to construct a new facility designed to produce 300 millimeter wafers using 32 nanometer process technology between July 2007 and July 2009. However, we are not obligated to commence construction, and our decision regarding proceeding with the construction is dependent on business conditions and market demand. Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are described in the chart set forth below: Facility Location ApproximateManufacturingArea SquareFootage Activity Penang, Malaysia 206,000 Assembly Singapore 194,000 Test, Mark & Packaging Suzhou, China 44,310 Test, Mark & Packaging Some assembly and final testing of our microprocessor and embedded processor products is performed by subcontractors in the United States and Asia. With respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, we have strategic relationships with three semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, United Microelectronics Corp. and Chartered. Currently, we are in volume production in TSMCs and UMCs 300 millimeter fabrication facilities. As of December 31, 2006, our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices were manufactured on 80 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 or 180 nanometer process technologies at third party foundries. Smaller process geometries can lead to gains in graphics processing performance, lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs. We intend to transition to 65 nanometer process technology for some of these products in 2007. From the foundry, wafers for our graphics products are delivered to our test, assembly and packaging partners including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Group, Amkor, King Yuan Electronics, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATS Chippac, who package and test the final application specific integrated circuit. We outsource board level graphics product manufacturing to third party manufacturers. These include Celestica, Fairway and PC Partner with locations in China. Our facility in Markham, Ontario, Canada is primarily devoted to prototyping and trial runs for new graphics product introductions. Raw Materials Our manufacturing processes require many raw materials, such as silicon wafers, IC packages, mold compound, substrates and various chemicals and gases, and the necessary equipment for manufacturing. We obtain these materials and equipment from a large number of suppliers located throughout the world. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. 17 Table of Contents Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 31, 2006, we had more than 6,000 patents in the United States and over 1,600 patent applications pending in the United States, including more than 600 patents in the United States and 400 patent applications in the United States that we acquired from ATI. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration thereof, is or would be material to our business. In connection with the formation of Spansion LLC as of June 2003 and the closing of Spansions initial public offering, or IPO, in December 2005, we and Fujitsu transferred to Spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement, or IPCAAMA. Under the IPCAAMA, Spansion became the owner or joint owner with each of us and Fujitsu, of specified patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and technology. The patents that we transferred included patents and patent applications covering Flash memory products and technology, the processes necessary to manufacture Flash memory products, and the operation and control of Flash memory products. We reserved rights, on a royalty free basis, to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to our affiliates and successors in interest. We also have the right to use the jointly owned intellectual property for our internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with our non competition obligations to Spansion. In addition, for as long as our ownership interest in Spansion remains above 12.5 percent, Spansion is required to identify its technology to us and to provide copies of, and training with respect to, that technology. Spansion also granted a non exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid and royalty free license of its rights in this technology to us. We may grant licenses under Spansions patents, provided that these licenses are of no broader scope than, and are subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to, any license of our patents granted in connection with such license, and the recipient of such license grants to Spansion a license of similar scope under its patents. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Fujitsu whereby each party was granted a non exclusive license under certain of the other partys respective semiconductor related patents. This patent cross license agreement terminates on June 30, 2013, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days notice following a change of control of the other party. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Spansion. The patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date prior to the termination of the patent cross license agreement. The agreement will automatically terminate on the later of June 30, 2013 and the date we sell our entire equity interest in Spansion. The agreements may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group. In addition, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the patent cross license agreement with Intel which was effective as of January 1, 2001. Under this agreement we granted each other a non exclusive license under each partys patents for the manufacture and sale of semiconductor products worldwide. We pay Intel a royalty for certain licensed microprocessor products sold by us or any AMD affiliate anywhere in the world. The license applies to each partys patents that have a first effective filing date during the capture period, which is the period from January 1, 2001 through January 1, 2010. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and does not correct the breach within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days written notice in the event of a filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or any adjudication thereof, the filing of any petition seeking reorganization under any law relating to bankruptcy, the appointment of a receiver, the making of any 18 Table of Contents assignment for the benefit of creditors, the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the other partys business, or in the event of a change of control. For purposes of our agreement with Intel, change of control means a transaction or a series of related transactions in which (i) one or more related parties who did not previously own at least a 50 percent interest in a party obtain at least a 50 percent interest in such party, and, in the reasonable business judgment of the other party, such change in ownership will have a material effect on the other partys business, or (ii) a party acquires, by merger, acquisition of assets or otherwise, all or any portion of another legal entity such that either the assets or market value of such party after the close of such transaction are greater than one and one third of the assets or market value of such party prior to such transaction. Backlog We manufacture and sell standard lines of products. Consequently, a significant portion of our sales are made from inventory on a current basis. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. These orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice and experience and the fact that substantially our entire order backlog is cancelable, we do not believe that such agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 16,500 employees. Environmental Regulations Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, and or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal or storage, or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our new semiconductor graphics business that we have added through the acquisition of ATI. It is possible that Intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets, which could shrink the total available market for certain of our discrete GPUs, that Intel could re enter the discrete GPU market, or that Intel will take other actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as designing a proprietary graphics interface. Moreover, computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets, particularly for notebooks, because they cost significantly less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream PCs. The success of our graphics business is dependent, in part, upon the success of our integrated chipset products. If our graphics products do not successfully address the discrete GPU and integrated chipset markets, our graphics business could be adversely affected. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures a large portion of its processors using 65 nanometer technology whereas we only began commercial shipments of processors 20 Table of Contents manufactured using 65 nanometer technology in the fourth quarter of 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using smaller process technologies, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products, which may result in market share gains for Intel. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ATI. The success of our recent acquisition of ATI depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of ATI with the businesses of AMD, and failure to realize these anticipated benefits could cause our business to be materially adversely affected. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon our successful integration of ATIs operations. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: retaining key employees; bridging possible differences in cultures and management philosophies; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and systems; coordinating sales and marketing functions; preserving our and ATIs customer, supplier, ecosystem partner and other important relationships; aligning and executing on new products roadmaps; minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; and coordinating geographically separate organizations. We cannot assure you that our integration of ATI will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will result from the acquisition. For example, it is possible that as a result of the acquisition, previous ATI customers of discrete GPUs may decide to purchase products that can be used with Intel platforms from one of our competitors or that ecosystem partners will be wary of continuing to do business with us because they view the former ATI operations as competitive with portions of their business. Any inability to integrate successfully, or a delay in integrating, ATI could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product design and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. For example, we recently opened a research and development facility in Shanghai and an advanced microprocessor development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Similarly, in connection with the recent acquisition of ATI, we plan to continue to invest in research and development related to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion. Moreover, in connection with the acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to 21 Table of Contents ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years. However, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to achieve planned investments in research and development or to otherwise maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. We have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. We anticipate that under this agreement, we will pay fees to IBM of between $473 million and $523 million in connection with joint development projects from 2007 to 2011. Capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with required features and performance levels that provide value to our customers and support and coincide with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies, such as what occurred with the multiple delays in the launch of our R600 GPU for the high end category of the PC market, we may lose credibility and our competitors may be able to take advantage of these delays by launching higher performing products before we do, which could cause us to lose market share and force us to discount the selling price of our products. Delays in developing or qualifying new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows. Market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain overall corporate average selling prices. If we are unable to introduce new products such as quad core processors or launch new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting these reductions in average selling prices of existing products, our revenues, inventories, gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to design and introduce new graphics products in a timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property. In the design and development of new graphics products and graphics product enhancements, we rely on third party intellectual property such as software development tools. Historically, ATI has experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of its products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including those of our customers; and excess production capacity. For example, in 2001 and 2002 we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. If the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future, we would be materially adversely affected. The demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our microprocessor business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs and servers. Industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our products may not grow and may even decrease. If demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. The business we acquired from ATI is also dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs, the consumer electronics market and, in particular, the markets for digital TVs, handheld devices, such as multimedia enabled mobile phones, and game consoles. A market decline in any of these industries would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets. In 2006, sales of our products to high growth markets such as China increased significantly compared to 2005, and these markets are an important area of future growth for us. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may not grow, and may even decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We expect competition to intensify due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and aggressive pricing by competitors. We believe that the main factors that determine our competitiveness are product quality, power consumption, reliability, speed, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We expect that competition will intensify in these markets and our competitors products may be less costly, provide better performance or 23 Table of Contents include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. With respect to our graphics products in particular, some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. In addition, as a result of the ATI acquisition, Intel may discriminate against us and put us as a competitive disadvantage by giving our competitors in the graphics market preferential access to interface or other useful information. Generally, we may not be able to compete effectively because of Intels market dominance and business practices designed to maintain it. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings. In addition, despite our recent acquisition of ATI, we continue to work with other third parties for graphics chips in order to provide our customers with a greater choice of technologies to best meet their needs. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intels proprietary bus interface protocol. If we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from designers and manufacturers of motherboards and chipsets, our business would be materially adversely affected. Our recent acquisition of ATI could exacerbate this problem because we plan to design and supply a significantly greater amount of graphics products ourselves. Doing so could cause third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers to be less willing to do business with us or to support our products out of a perceived risk that we will be less willing to support their products or because we may compete with them. As a result, these third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers could forge relationships, or strengthen their existing relationships, with our competitors. If the designers, manufacturers and suppliers of graphics chips, motherboards, and other components decrease their support for our product offerings and increase their support for the product offerings of our competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. We must achieve further market acceptance of our 64 bit technology, AMD64, or we will be materially adversely affected. We are making substantial investments in our microprocessor roadmaps and platforms, particularly as we transition from dual core to multi core processors. Increasing market acceptance of our processors, and the AMD64 technology on which they are based, is subject to risks and uncertainties including: the continued support of application program providers for our 64 bit instruction set, including timely development of 64 bit software applications and applications that can take advantage of the functionality of our multi core processors; our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner using advanced process technologies, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers; and the availability, performance and feature set of components designed for these processors, in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by our customers. If we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, we would be materially adversely affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against Intel, our business may be materially adversely affected. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intels Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, which we refer to collectively as Intel, in the United States District Court for the District 24 Table of Contents of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. Our complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of Intels customers in dealing with AMD. Also, on June 30, 2005, our subsidiary in Japan, AMD Japan K.K., filed an action in Japan against Intel K.K. in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted Intels motion to dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007, adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to develop evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing AMD from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. The Court also set an immovable trial date of April 27, 2009. If our antitrust lawsuits against Intel are ultimately unsuccessful, our business, including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market, could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five customers accounted for almost half of our total revenue in 2006. Moreover, historically a significant portion of ATIs revenues were derived from sales to a small number of customers, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues from our graphics and consumer electronics businesses in the future. For example, for the period from October 25, 2006 to December 31, 2006, one handset manufacturer accounted for more than half of the revenue, and one game console provider accounted for a significant portion of the revenue, of our Consumer Electronics segment. Moreover, two customers accounted for approximately one third of the revenue of our Graphics and Chipsets segment. If one of our top microprocessor, graphics business or consumer electronics customers decided to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers were to materially reduce its operations or its demand for our products, we would be materially adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse affect on us. There may be situations in which our microprocessor manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products. Our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could result in an adverse effect on our relationships with customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In November 2004, we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing whereby Chartered agreed to become a contract manufacturer for our AMD64 based microprocessors. Although Chartered has begun production, the ability of Chartered to continue to ramp production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control, including Chartereds ability to continue to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis. In addition, the additional capacity gained through the use of 300 millimeter wafers at Fab 36 and our plans to increase capacity at Fab 36 and convert Fab 30 into a 300 millimeter wafer manufacturing facility play a 25 Table of Contents fundamental role in our growth plans for the next several years. In order to transition Fab 30 to a 300 millimeter facility, we plan to incrementally bring down its 200 millimeter output beginning in mid 2007, and we do not expect to have any 300 millimeter output until early 2008. If we are not able to achieve our production plans on a timely basis, we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand for our microprocessor products. If we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our microprocessor products, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements, we could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third party foundries and other contractors to manufacture certain products. We rely on independent foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corp. to manufacture our graphics and chipset products. Chartered Semiconductor manufactures some of our microprocessor products and products for consumer electronics devices. Independent contractors also perform the assembly, testing and packaging of these products. We obtain these manufacturing services for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices on a purchase order basis and these foundries are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product. Accordingly, our graphics and consumer electronics businesses depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices. We cannot assure you that these manufacturers will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements. The manufacturers we use fabricate wafers for other companies, including certain of our competitors. With respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, they could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice. We must have reliable relationships with our wafer manufacturers and subcontractors to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. If we move production of our products to new manufacturers or if current manufacturers implement new process technology or design rules, any transition difficulties may result in lower yields or poorer performance of our products. Because it could take several quarters to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific graphics product in a short time frame. Other risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturers include reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and cost, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors, reduced ability to manage inventory and parts, and exposure to foreign countries and operations. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of wafers, our ability to meet customer demand for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses may be adversely affected and this could have an adverse effect on us. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessor manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers that we use to manufacture our microprocessor products. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessor products. Similarly, certain non proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors 26 Table of Contents used in the manufacture of our graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources and often subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us. If we fail to improve the efficiency of our supply chain in order to respond to increases or changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we must continually improve the management of our supply chain by synchronizing the entire supply chain, from sourcing through manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment. As we continue to grow our business, acquire new OEM customers and strengthen relationships with existing OEM customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because OEMs tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time frames in which they require delivery of these products. In the second half of 2006, we experienced challenges in the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the significant ramp in microprocessor units sold across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis. Also, the breadth of our product portfolio increased significantly as a result of our acquisition of ATI, which put stress on our supply chain. If we fail to adequately improve the efficiency of our supply chain and adjust our operations in response to future increases or changes in OEM demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Industry overcapacity could cause us to under utilize our microprocessor manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us. Both we and our competitor, Intel, have added significant capacity in recent years, both by expanding capacity at wafer fabrication facilities and by transitioning to more advanced manufacturing technologies, and we plan on further increasing our capacity by expanding the production capacity of Fab 36 and converting Fab 30 into a 300 millimeter wafer manufacturing facility. In the past, capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market, which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us. It is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve, making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity. If our target markets do not grow as we anticipate, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities, which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products for which demand is lower than we anticipate. In addition, during periods of industry overcapacity, customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity, which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements. Many of our costs are fixed. Accordingly, during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products, our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. When this occurs, our operating results are materially adversely affected. If the demand for our microprocessor products is not consistent with our increased expectations, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities or we may not fully utilize the reserved capacity at Chartereds foundry. This may have a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to 27 Table of Contents maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continually modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, and delays in the development or implementation of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. For example, beginning in mid 2007 we plan to incrementally bring down 200 millimeter output at Fab 30 in order to transition this facility to 300 millimeter manufacturing. While this facility is being converted, we will have some fixed costs that cannot be scaled down in proportion. Improving our microprocessor manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to: develop advanced product and process technologies; successfully transition to advanced process technologies; ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities; and achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies. We have begun to ramp 65 nanometer production and our goal is to be substantially converted to 65 nanometer in Fab 36 by mid 2007. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do. Our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. Similarly, the operating results of our graphics and consumer electronics businesses are dependent upon achieving planned semiconductor manufacturing yields. Our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured at independent foundries, but we have the responsibility for product design and the design and performance of the tooling required for manufacturing. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from either design or process technology failures. In addition, yield problems require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer and sometimes the customer as well. The offshore location of our principal manufacturers compounds these risks, due to the increased effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. We cannot assure you that we or our foundries will identify and fix problems in a timely manner, and achieve acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability, in cooperation with our independent foundries, to achieve planned production yields for these products could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, failure to reach planned production yields over time could result in us not having sufficient product supply to meet demand and or higher production costs and lower gross margins for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses. This could materially adversely affect us. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. If we fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our microprocessors would be materially adversely affected. 28 Table of Contents If we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations. For 2007, we plan to make approximately $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, primarily related to expanding production capacity at Fab 36, beginning the conversion of Fab 30 from manufacturing on 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers and purchasing equipment for a new facility to support bump and test activities. However, our ability to fund these capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, in order to finance our acquisition of ATI, we borrowed $2.5 billion pursuant to a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. dated October 24, 2006 (October 2006 Term Loan). While amounts remain outstanding under this agreement, we are required to prepay these amounts with (i) 100 percent of the net cash proceeds from any debt incurred by us or a restricted subsidiary, (ii) 50 percent of net cash proceeds from the issuance of any capital stock by us (subject to specified exceptions); (iii) 100 percent of extraordinary receipts (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) in excess of $30 million; (iv) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside of the ordinary course in excess of $30 million, subject to a reinvestment allowance; (v) commencing with the fiscal year ending December 30, 2007, 50 percent of excess cash flow; and (vi) 100 percent of net cash proceeds from sales of capital stock of Spansion Inc. See Part II, Item 7, MD&A Liquidity, for additional information on the definition of excess cash flow. These mandatory prepayment requirements limit our ability to use our cash flow, borrow additional funds or conduct equity offerings for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position. As of December 31, 2006 we had consolidated debt of approximately $3.8 billion. In addition, a significant portion of our consolidated debt bears a variable interest rate, which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Our substantial indebtedness may: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, 29 Table of Contents and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, amounts outstanding under our October 2006 Term Loan are secured by, among other things, our accounts receivable, a pledge of the capital stock of specific material subsidiaries, specific intercompany debt, and proceeds from any sale of our equity interest in Spansion Inc. Moreover, as a result of the security interest granted to Morgan Stanley, holders of our outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (7.75% Notes) received an equal and ratable security interest. These assets are not available to be used as security in other borrowing arrangements, which may also have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The October 2006 Term Loan and the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments if a default or an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; consolidate, merge or sell assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; make or commit to make any capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business exceeding a certain amount; issue or sell any shares of capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries; permit domestic wholly owned restricted subsidiaries to guarantee our indebtedness unless they also guarantee the October 2006 Term Loan; and permit our Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the October 2006 Term Loan) to exceed 2.25 to 1.00. In addition, the Fab 36 Loan Agreements contain restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of our Germany subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, or AMD Fab 36 KG, and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy these covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. 30 Table of Contents Moreover, our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the October 2006 Term Loan or the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under the October 2006 Term Loan or the note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing our 7.75% Notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us. We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected. If our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenues, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury, and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect us. In addition, because we sell directly to consumers, we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. 31 Table of Contents Our receipt of royalty revenues is dependent upon the success of third party products. Our graphics technology for the game console market is being used in the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft&reg; Xbox 360 game consoles. The only revenues that we receive from these technology platforms are in the form of non recurring engineering revenues, as well as royalties paid to us by Nintendo and Microsoft based upon the market success of their products. Accordingly, our royalty revenues will be directly related to the sales of these products. We anticipate royalties in future years resulting from our agreements with Nintendo and Microsoft. However, we have no control over the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Microsoft and we cannot assure you that sales of those products will achieve expected levels in the current or future fiscal years. Consequently, the revenues from royalties expected by us from these technology platforms may not be fully realized, and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our entry into new consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties. As a result of the ATI acquisition, we sell products for the consumer electronics market, including digital TVs and color mobile phones. There are a significant number of competitors targeting this market. The delay in acceptance of digital TV technology has also provided further opportunities for competitors to enter this market. In addition, as the telecommunications, cable and consumer electronics industries and their suppliers undergo a period of convergence, we expect that competition will increase in these markets. Our ability to succeed in these new consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties, including acceptance of our graphics and multimedia processors, the development of new technologies sufficient to meet market demand, the need to develop customer relationships, different sales strategies and channels, new and different industry standards from those in the PC market and changing strategic alliances. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in this new market. If we are unable to successfully introduce products and compete in this market, we could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel, including the more than 4,000 employees we acquired through the ATI acquisition. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co source some information technology services. We rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for some of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third party in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for some facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. 32 Table of Contents Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements. Generally, our customers may cancel orders more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Moreover, PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on profit margins. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products. Our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. For example, all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. In addition, our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured, assembled and tested by independent third parties in the Asia Pacific region and inventory related to those products is stored there. We also have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated revenue was 75 percent in 2006, and China was one of our largest and fastest growing markets. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; 33 Table of Contents changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in achieving headcount reductions; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health or safety, natural disasters or general economic factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, potentially longer payment cycles, potentially increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. For example, Chinas economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and the Chinese government introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth. A decline in economic conditions in China could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. The occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, directly or indirectly, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales, and our supply chain. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and yen, and as a result of our recent acquisition of ATI, the Canadian dollar. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our Canadian dollar and euro denominated expenses and yen based raw material purchases to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of expenditures for items such as payroll, 34 Table of Contents equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner. Foreign laws may provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, we would be materially adversely affected. We are party to litigation, including intellectual property litigation, and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of ATI, we have assumed responsibility for ATIs legal proceedings which include a securities litigation proceeding and a consumer class action. In November 2006, we received a subpoena for documents and information in connection with the U.S. Department of Justices criminal investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. We also sell products to consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. 35 Table of Contents With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified, or third parties may bring actions against us, based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities. Our operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging, and we continue our work to ensure compliance across product lines. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of lead free products may be less favorable compared to lead based products or that the transition to lead free products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. We have management 36 Table of Contents systems in place to identify and ensure compliance with such requirements and have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. All of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. The independent foundries used to manufacture our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are located in Hsin Chiu and Tainan, Taiwan. A significant amount of our inventories for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses are stored in Taiwan prior to delivery to customers. Many of our assembly, testing and packaging suppliers for our graphics products are also located in southern Taiwan. On September 22, 1999, Taiwan suffered a major earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and disrupted the operations of these manufacturing suppliers and contributed to a temporary shortage of graphics processors. Additional earthquakes, fires or other occurrences that disrupt our manufacturing suppliers may occur in the future. To the extent that the supply from our independent foundries or suppliers is interrupted for a prolonged period of time or terminated for any reason, we may not have sufficient time to replace our supply of products manufactured by those foundries. Moreover, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material effect on our cash, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. For example, the Canadian Revenue Agency, or CRA, is in the process of auditing ATI for the years 1999 2004 with respect to transactions between ATI and its subsidiaries. We could be subject to significant tax liability as well as a loss of certain tax credits and other tax attributes as a result of the CRA audit. Risks Related to Our Ownership of Spansion Inc. Common Stock Spansions financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours through December 20, 2005, but as a result of its initial public offering, we currently report our interest in Spansion using the equity method of accounting. Following Spansions IPO, we owned approximately 38 percent of Spansions outstanding common stock. In November 2006 we sold shares of Spansions common stock, and as a result, as of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 21 percent of Spansions outstanding common stock. Our 21 percent share of Spansions net income (loss) will impact our net income (loss). The following risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces could affect Spansions financial position or results of operations and correspondingly our financial position and results of operations. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that Spansion faces. Spansion also faces many of the risks and uncertainties that we face as described above in this Risk Factors section, as well as those set forth in Spansions Annual Report on Form 10 K and other SEC filings, to which we refer you. 37 Table of Contents The demand for Spansions products depends in large part on continued growth in the industries into which they are sold. A market decline in any of these industries, or a decline in demand for Flash memory products in these industries, would have a material adverse effect on Spansions results of operations. Sales of Spansions Flash memory products are dependent to a large degree upon consumer demand for mobile phones. In fiscal 2006, wireless customers, which primarily consist of mobile phone OEMs represented the largest market for NOR Flash memory. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, sales to wireless Flash memory customers drove a majority of Spansions sales. Similarly, sales of Spansions products targeting embedded Flash memory customers are dependent upon demand for consumer electronics such as set top boxes, or STBs, and DVD players, automotive electronics, industrial electronics such as networking equipment, PCs and PC peripheral equipment such as printers. Sales of Spansions products are also dependent upon the inclusion of increasing amounts of Flash memory content in some of these products. In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, sales to embedded Flash memory customers drove a significant portion of Spansions sales. If demand for mobile phones or products in the embedded portion of the Flash memory market, or the Flash memory content of these products, is below Spansions expectations, if the functionality of successive generations of such products does not require increasing Flash memory density or if such products no longer require Flash memory due to alternative technologies or otherwise, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Spansion has lost key intellectual property arrangements because it is no longer a beneficiary of our patent cross license agreements and other licenses, which creates a greatly increased risk of patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against Spansion. As a majority owned subsidiary through December 20, 2005, Spansion had been the beneficiary of our intellectual property arrangements with third parties, including patent cross license agreements with other major semiconductor companies such as Intel, Motorola and IBM, and licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in Spansions products and software used to operate its business. As a result of the conversion of Spansions outstanding shares of Class D common stock into shares of Spansions Class A common stock in November 2006, Spansion ceased to be a beneficiary under most of the remainder of these license agreements. As a result, Spansion may be subject to claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of Spansions products and the operation of Spansions business. Therefore, absent negotiating its own license agreements with the third parties who own such intellectual property, Spansion will be vulnerable to claims by such parties that Spansions products or operations infringe such parties patents or other intellectual property rights. Spansion will continue to attempt to negotiate its own agreements and arrangements with third parties for intellectual property and technology that are important to Spansions business, including the intellectual property that it previously had access to through its relationship with us. Spansion will also attempt to acquire new patents as Spansions success in negotiating patent cross license agreements with other industry participants will depend in large part upon the strength of its patent portfolio relative to that of the third party with which it is negotiating. If the third party benefits from an existing patent cross license agreement with us or Fujitsu, in many cases it will retain the rights that it has under that agreement, including rights to utilize the patents that we and Fujitsu transferred to Spansion in connection with Spansions reorganization as Spansion LLC in June 2003. In many cases, any such third party will also retain such rights to utilize any patents that have been issued to Spansion or acquired by Spansion subsequent to Spansions reorganization and prior to Spansions IPO or, in some cases, at the time of the conversion of the Class D common stock. Spansions negotiating position will therefore be impaired, because the other party will already be entitled to utilize a large number of Spansions patents, while Spansion no longer has the right to utilize that partys patents. As a result, Spansion may be unable to obtain access to the other partys patent portfolio on favorable terms or at all. Similarly, with respect to licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in Spansions products or software used to operate Spansions business, 38 Table of Contents Spansion may not be able to negotiate prices with these third parties on terms as favorable to Spansion as those previously available to Spansion because it is not able to take advantage of our size and purchasing power. These parties, and other third parties with whom we had no prior intellectual property arrangement, may file lawsuits against Spansion seeking damages (potentially including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of Spansions products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of Spansions business as presently conducted. Such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming. Spansion cannot be sure that such litigation would be avoided or successfully concluded. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture or sale of some or all of Spansions products, would have a material adverse effect on Spansion. A significant market shift to NAND architecture could materially adversely affect Spansion. Flash memory products are generally based either on NOR architecture or NAND architecture. To date, Spansions Flash memory products have been based on NOR architecture which are typically produced at a higher cost per bit than NAND based products. Spansion does not currently manufacture products based on NAND architecture. Spansion has developed its MirrorBit ORNAND architecture to address certain portions of the integrated category of the Flash memory market served by NAND based products, but it cannot be certain that its MirrorBit ORNAND based products will satisfactorily address those market needs. During 2004, industry sales of NAND based Flash memory products grew at a higher rate than sales of NOR based Flash memory products, resulting in NAND vendors in aggregate gaining a greater share of the overall Flash memory market and NOR vendors in aggregate losing overall market share. This trend continued in 2005 and 2006 when sales of NAND based Flash memory products represented a majority of the Flash memory products sold in the overall Flash memory market. In 2005, and the first half of 2006, sales of NAND based Flash memory products represented a majority of the Flash memory products sold in the overall Flash memory market. Moreover, the removable storage category of the Flash memory market, which is predominantly served by floating gate NAND vendors, is expected to be a significant portion of the Flash memory market for the foreseeable future. As mobile phones and other consumer electronics become more advanced, they will require higher density Flash memory to meet the increased data storage requirements associated with music downloads, photos and videos. Because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications, OEMs may increasingly choose higher density floating gate NAND based Flash memory products over MirrorBit NOR , ORNAND or Quad based Flash memory products for their applications. If this occurs and OEMs continue to prefer the attributes and characteristics of floating gate NAND based products over those of MirrorBit NOR , ORNAND or Quad based products for their applications, Spansion may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, some floating gate NAND vendors are manufacturing on 300 millimeter wafers or may choose to utilize more advanced manufacturing process technologies than Spansion uses today to offer products competitive to Spansions at a lower cost. If floating gate NAND vendors continue to increase their share of the Flash memory market, Spansions market share may decrease, which would materially adversely affect Spansion. Competitors may introduce new memory or other technologies that may make Spansions Flash memory products uncompetitive or obsolete. Spansions competitors are working on a number of new technologies, including FRAM, MRAM, polymer and phase change based memory technologies. If successfully developed and commercialized as a viable alternative to Flash memory, these or other technologies could pose a competitive threat to a number of Flash memory companies, including Spansion. In addition, Spansion and some of Spansions competitors have licensed Flash memory intellectual property associated with NROM technology from a third party. Use of this NROM intellectual property may allow these competitors to develop Flash memory technology that may compete with MirrorBit technology. 39 Table of Contents If Spansion fails to successfully develop products based on its new MirrorBit NOR, or MirrorBit ORNAND or MirrorBit Quad architectures, or if there is a lack of market acceptance of products based on these products, Spansions future operating results would be materially adversely affected. Spansion is positioning itself to address the increasing demand for higher density data optimized Flash memory by offering products based on its new MirrorBit ORNAND and MirrorBit Quad architectures. The success of these architectures requires that Spansion timely and cost effectively develop, manufacture and market products based on these architectures that are competitive with floating gate NAND based Flash memory products. Spansion began commercial shipments of MirrorBit ORNAND based products in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and announced the MirrorBit Quad based family of products in January 2007. However, if Spansion fails to develop and commercialize these products and additional products based on these architectures on a timely basis, Spansions future operating results would be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, if market acceptance of products based on Spansions MirrorBit technology occurs at a slower rate than Spansion anticipates, its ability to compete will be reduced, and Spansion would be materially adversely affected. If Spansion does not achieve market acceptance of these products or subsequent MirrorBit products, Spansions future operating results would be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer or a reduction in demand for Spansions Flash memory products from a significant customer in the mobile phone market could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Sales of Spansions products are dependent to a large extent on demand for mobile phones. Historically, a small number of wireless Flash memory customers have driven a substantial portion of Spansions net sales. If one of these customers decided to stop buying Spansions Flash memory products, or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for Spansions products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 Spansion was materially adversely affected by the reduced demand for mid range wireless handsets that incorporate custom high density NOR based Flash memory solutions. Spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition. Spansion currently has and will continue to have for the foreseeable future, a substantial amount of indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness may: require Spansion to use a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to make debt service payments; make it difficult for Spansion to satisfy its financial obligations; limit Spansions ability to use its cash flows or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; limit Spansions flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and industry; place Spansion at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors; and increase Spansions vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. If Spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flows and obtain external financing, it may be unable to make all of its planned capital expenditures. Spansions ability to fund anticipated capital expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flows from operations and the availability of external financing. Spansions capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on its cash flows and may decrease its cash balances. The timing and amount of Spansions capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including demand for its products, product mix, changes in industry conditions and market competition. Spansion may need to assess markets for external financing, including debt and equity. Such financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Any equity financing 40 Table of Contents would cause dilution to its stockholders. Spansions inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require it to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If Spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flows or obtain external financing, it may be delayed in achieving, or may not achieve, needed manufacturing capacity, and Spansion could be materially adversely affected. If Spansion is unable to timely and efficiently expand its manufacturing capacity to implement 300 millimeter wafer capacity at SP1, Spansions business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Spansion intends to expand its manufacturing capacity to produce approximately 15,000 to 20,000 300 millimeter wafers per month at SP1. Spansions goal is to have 65 and 45 nanometer process technology on 300 millimeter wafer capacity in place in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2006 Spansion commenced a plan to spend approximately $1.2 billion over three years to construct and equip its planned flash memory manufacturing facility in Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, which Spansion refers to as SP1. However, the actual cost and capacity achieved will vary depending on various factors, including available financing and future product demand. Financing for the construction of and equipment for SP1 may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. If Spansion does not achieve its desired capacity at the anticipated cost, or if Spansion cannot obtain suitable financing, Spansion may be delayed in achieving, or may not achieve, such capacity, and Spansion could be materially adversely affected. The timing for implementing 300 millimeter capacity in SP1 will also depend in part on Spansions ability to execute its plan for constructing and equipping the facility and other factors that may be beyond its control, such as delivery schedules for the required machinery and equipment and construction schedules. If Spansion is delayed in implementing this capability or is unable to obtain foundry services at competitive rates or to timely and efficiently ramp production on 300 millimeter wafers, it will not achieve anticipated cost savings associated with this technology and its gross margins could decline. Even if Spansion is successful in implementing this capacity, if the demand for its products is not sufficient to support the additional capacity when it becomes available, it could be materially and adversely affected. If Spansions cost reduction efforts are not effective, Spansions business could be materially adversely affected. Spansion continues to undertake a number of actions in an effort to significantly reduce its expenses. These actions include and have included streamlining operations, continuing to align manufacturing utilization to the level of demand for Spansion products, controlling increasing testing costs and working with us and Fujitsu to reduce costs under services agreements. We cannot assure you that any of these actions will occur as anticipated or at all, or that Spansion will be able to achieve significant cost reductions. If Spansions cost reduction efforts are unsuccessful, Spansion would be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse affect on Spansion. There may be situations in which Spansions manufacturing capacity is inadequate to meet the demand for some of its products. Spansion increasingly depends on foundry, subcontractor and similar arrangements with third parties to meet demand. Spansions arrangements with third party suppliers do not necessarily include capacity guarantees. If a third party manufacturer on which it relies does not have the capacity to deliver an adequate amount of product to meet actual demand, Spansion may not be able to obtain the manufacturing capacity, either in its own facilities or through other third party arrangements, to meet such demand. During fiscal 2006, demand for certain of Spansions products exceeded the available supply. As a result, Spansion was unable to meet the demand of some of its customers for these products. This could adversely impact Spansions relationships with customers, cause harm to Spansions reputation in the marketplace, cause these customers to move future business to Spansions competitors or cause Spansion to make financial concessions to its customers. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Also, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 and the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Spansion experienced capacity constraints for 41 Table of Contents final test and assembly of some of its products. These constraints continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. While Spansion has worked internally and with subcontractors to increase capacity to meet anticipated demand, it cannot be assured that it will not experience similar constraints in the future. These capacity constraints limit Spansions ability to respond to rapid and short term surges in demand for its products. If Spansion is unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand, either in its own facilities or through foundry, subcontractor or similar arrangements with third parties, or if it is unable to obtain foundry services at competitive rates, Spansions business may be materially adversely affected. Spansions increased reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks that could materially adversely affect Spansion. Spansion currently obtains foundry services from other companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, and following the sale of its JV1 and JV2 manufacturing facilities Spansion will also obtain foundry services from Fujitsu. Spansion also uses independent contractors to perform some of the assembly, testing and packaging of its products. Third party manufacturers are often under no obligation to provide Spansion with any specified minimum quantity of product. Spansion depends on these manufacturers to allocate to Spansion a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet Spansions needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to Spansion on a timely basis at acceptable prices. These manufacturers may not be able to meet Spansions near term or long term manufacturing requirements. These manufacturers also make products for other companies, including certain of Spansions competitors, and or for themselves and could choose to prioritize capacity for themselves or other customers beyond any minimum guaranteed amounts, reduce deliveries to Spansion or, in the absence of price guarantees, increase the prices they charge Spansion on short notice, such that Spansion may not be able to pass cost increases on to Spansions customers. Because it could take several quarters or more to establish a relationship with a new manufacturing partner, Spansion may be unable to secure an alternative supply for specific products in a short timeframe or at all at an acceptable cost to satisfy Spansions production requirements. In addition, Spansion may be required to incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply. Other risks associated with Spansions increased dependence on third party manufacturers include: their ability to adapt to Spansions proprietary technology, reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and cost, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of Spansions intellectual property, reduced ability to manage inventory and parts and risks associated with operating in foreign countries. If Spansion is unable to secure sufficient or reliable suppliers of wafers or obtain the necessary assembling, testing and packaging services, Spansions ability to meet customer demand for its products may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Spansions business has been characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods, which can negatively affect Spansions results of operations unless it is able to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices. Average selling prices for Spansions products historically have declined over relatively short time periods. Spansion is unable to predict pricing conditions for future periods. Even in the absence of downturns or oversupply in the industry, average selling prices of Spansions products have decreased during the products lives. When Spansions average selling prices decline, its net sales and net income decline unless it is able to compensate by selling more units, reducing its manufacturing costs or introducing new, higher margin products that have higher densities and or incorporate advanced features. Spansion has experienced declining average selling prices in the past, and it has stated that it expects to continue to experience them in the future, although Spansion cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be. If Spansions average selling prices continue to decline, its operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, average selling prices for Spansions products may also be adversely affected by a significant decline in the price for NAND products. Such a decline may result in downward price pressure in the overall Flash memory market, which would adversely affect Spansion. 42 Table of Contents Spansion is party to intellectual property litigation and may become party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products. Tessera, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Spansion alleging that it has infringed certain of Tesseras patents. Tessera has sought to enjoin such alleged infringement and to recover an unspecified amount of damages. In addition, Fujitsu has informed Spansion that Texas Instruments has asserted that a number of its products infringe some of Texas Instruments patents. Fujitsu has also provided Spansion with formal notice that they believe Spansion has a duty to defend or indemnify Fujitsu against Texas Instruments claims under the terms of its distribution agreement. Since then, Spansion and Fujitsu have been discussing the issues raised by this notice and if Fujitsu were to terminate the distribution agreement with Spansion, it could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Defending these alleged infringement claims and similar claims could be extremely expensive and time consuming and an award of damages or an injunction could have a material adverse effect on Spansion. Intense competition in the Flash memory market could materially adversely affect Spansion. Spansions principal competitors in the Flash memory market are Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., Macronix International Co., Ltd., Toshiba Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corp., Renesas Technology Corp., Micron Technology, Inc. and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. In the future, Spansions principal competitors may also include SanDisk Corporation and IM Flash Technology, LLC, the joint venture between Intel and Micron Technology, Inc. The Flash memory market is characterized by intense competition. The basis of competition is cost, selling price, performance, quality, customer relationships and ability to provide value added solutions. In particular, in the past, Spansions competitors have aggressively priced their products in order to increase market share, which resulted in decreased average selling prices for Spansions products in the second half of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and adversely impacted its results of operations. Some of Spansions competitors, including Intel, Samsung, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba, Sharp and Renesas, are more diversified than Spansion is and may be able to sustain lower operating margins in their Flash memory business based on the profitability of their other, non Flash memory businesses. In addition, recent capital investments by competitors have resulted in substantial industry manufacturing capacity, which may further contribute to a competitive pricing environment. Moreover, some of Spansions competitors are able to manufacture on 300 millimeter wafers or may choose to utilize more advanced manufacturing process technologies than Spansion uses today to offer products competitive to Spansions at a lower cost. Spansion has stated that it expects competition in the market for Flash memory devices to intensify as existing manufacturers introduce new products, new manufacturers enter the market, industry wide production capacity increases and competitors aggressively price their Flash memory products to increase market share. Competition also may increase if NOR memory vendors merge, if NAND memory vendors acquire NOR businesses or other NAND businesses, or if Spansions competitors otherwise consolidate their operations. Furthermore, Spansion faces increasing competition from NAND Flash memory vendors in some portions of the integrated Flash memory market. Spansion has also stated that it expects to face competition as it addresses new applications with the introduction of Spansions MirrorBit ORNAND and MirrorBit Quad based products. These products are intended to allow Spansion to compete in the data storage portion of the integrated category and select portions of the removable category of the Flash memory market that might otherwise be served by NAND based Flash memory products or other non volatile storage technologies such as ROM or optical discs. As a result, Spansion may compete with a number of established NAND based Flash memory vendors and other incumbent suppliers of alternative technology in marketing and selling these products. Moreover, Spansions MirrorBit ORNAND and MirrorBit Quad based products may not have the price, performance, quality and other features necessary to compete successfully for these applications. 43 Table of Contents To compete successfully, Spansion must decrease its manufacturing costs and develop, introduce and sell products that meet the increasing demand for greater Flash memory content in mobile phones, consumer electronics and automotive applications, among other markets, at competitive prices. If Spansion is unable to compete effectively, it could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or adequate supplies of satisfactory materials are not available to manufacture Spansions products, Spansion could be materially adversely affected. Spansions manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. Spansion purchases equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to Spansion or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that Spansion purchases is complex, it is difficult for Spansion to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Some raw materials Spansion uses in the manufacture of Spansions products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Spansions manufacturing operations also depend upon the quality and usability of the materials Spansion uses in its products, including raw materials and wafers Spansion receives from its suppliers. For example, in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Spansion had lower than expected yields on 12,000 raw wafers received from one of its suppliers and Spansions revenue and gross margins were adversely affected. If the materials Spansion receives from its suppliers do not meet Spansions manufacturing requirements or product specifications, Spansion may be materially adversely affected. Spansion also relies on purchasing commercial memory die from third party suppliers to incorporate these die into multi chip package, or MCP, products. The availability of these third party purchased commercial die is subject to market availability, and the process technology roadmaps and manufacturing capacities of Spansions vendors. For example, Spansions production was constrained in the first half of fiscal 2004 because of difficulties in procuring adequate supply of pseudo static RAM, or pSRAM. In addition, some of Spansions major suppliers, including Samsung, are also Spansions competitors. Interruption of supply from a competitor that is a supplier or otherwise or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If Spansion is unable to procure these materials, or if the materials it receives from Spansions suppliers do not meet Spansions production requirements or product specifications, Spansion may have to reduce its manufacturing operations or its manufacturing yields may be adversely affected. Such a reduction and yield issues have in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on Spansion. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares for an extended period of time, then our results of operations may be adversely affected. If the market value of our shares of Spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares and the decline in the market value level is deemed other than temporary, then we may be required to take an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the book value and the market value. For the quarter in which we take any such impairment charge, our results of operations could be adversely affected by the amount of such impairment charge. In addition, the carrying value of our investment in Spansion on our balance sheet would also be reduced. Therefore, sustained decreases in the market price of Spansions common stock could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have not received any written comments that were issued more than 180 days before December 31, 2006, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES At December 31, 2006, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 2.8 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices. Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture company that owns this facility. We own five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 165,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. In some cases, we lease all or a portion of the land on which our facilities are located. We lease approximately 218,000 square feet of land in Singapore and 270,000 square feet of land in Suzhou, China for our microprocessor and test facility. In addition, Fab 30 and Fab 36 are located on approximately 9.7 million square feet of land. Of this amount, Fab 36 owns approximately 5.4 million square feet, and both the facility and the land are encumbered by a lien securing the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG, the entity that owns the Fab 36 assets, under its EUR 700 Million Term Loan Facility Agreement with a consortium of banks in connection with the Fab 36 project, (Fab 36 Loan Agreements.) See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements. As of December 31, 2006, we also leased approximately 3.0 million square feet of space for engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative use, including a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2018. We also have approximately 220,000 square feet of building space that is currently vacant. We continue to have lease obligations with respect to this space that expire at various dates through 2011. We are actively marketing this space for sublease. Spansion leases approximately 71,000 square feet from us. In April 2005, we announced plans for a new campus for design and administrative functions to be developed on approximately 58 acres in Austin, Texas. We expect that the campus will consist of approximately 825,000 square feet. We intend to incorporate advanced environmentally sensitive building techniques and materials during the design, development and construction process and to concentrate development to approximately 33 of the available 58 acres. The remainder of the land would remain undeveloped. Construction of the new campus is underway and we expect that we will occupy the facility in the second half of 2007 or the first half of 2008. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy, or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that, except as discussed above, the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In addition to ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, AMD or its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, ATI, were party to the following material legal proceedings. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and should any of these actions or proceedings against us be successful, we may be subject to significant damages awards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 45 Table of Contents AMD v. Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, Civil Action No. 05 441, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On June 27, 2005, AMD filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, collectively Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. The complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that in effect limit Intels customers ability and or incentive to deal with AMD. The complaint alleges anti competitive business practices, including: Forcing major customers into Intel exclusive deals in return for outright cash payments, discriminatory pricing or marketing subsidies conditioned on the exclusion of AMD; Forcing other major customers into partial exclusivity agreements by conditioning rebates, allowances and market development funds on customers agreement to severely limit or forego entirely purchases from AMD; Establishing a system of discriminatory and retroactive incentives triggered by purchases at such high levels as to have the intended effect of denying customers the freedom to purchase any significant volume of processors from AMD; Establishing and enforcing quotas among key retailers, effectively requiring them to stock overwhelmingly or exclusively computers with Intel microprocessors, and thereby artificially limiting consumer choice; and Forcing PC makers and technology partners to boycott AMD product launches or promotions. AMD has requested the following findings and remedies: A finding that Intel is abusing its market power by forcing on the industry technical standards and products that have as their main purpose the handicapping of AMD in the marketplace; A finding that Intel is wrongfully maintaining its monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and treble damages to AMD in an amount to be proven at trial, pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15(a); A finding that Intel has made secret payments and allowance of rebates and discounts, and that Intel secretly and discriminatorily extended to certain purchasers special services or privileges, all in violation of California Business & Professions Code 17045, and treble damages for AMDs resulting lost profits in an amount to be proven at trial; A finding that Intel has intentionally interfered with valuable business relationships of AMD to AMDs economic detriment and damages to AMD in an amount to be proven at trial for its resulting losses, as well as punitive damages, as permitted by law; Injunctive relief prohibiting Intel from engaging in any further conduct unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act or Section 17045 of the California Business and Professions Code; An award to AMD of such other, further and different relief as may be necessary or appropriate to restore and maintain competitive conditions in the x86 microprocessor market; and An award of attorneys fees and costs. Intel filed its answer on September 1, 2005. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted the motion of Intel Corporation to dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007, adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to develop evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing AMD from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in 46 Table of Contents the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. The Court also set an immovable trial date of April 27, 2009. The discovery process is ongoing. Other Related Proceedings On June 30, 2005, our Japanese subsidiary, AMD Japan K.K., or AMD Japan, filed an action in Japan against Intel Corporations Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, or Intel K.K., in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. Through its suit in the Tokyo High Court, AMD Japan seeks US$50 million in damages, following on the Japan Fair Trade Commissions (JFTC) findings in its March 8, 2005 Recommendation, or the JFTC Recommendation, that Intel K.K. committed violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. The JFTC Recommendation concluded that Intel K.K. interfered with AMD Japans business activities by providing large amounts of funds to five Japanese PC manufacturers (NEC, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi) on the condition that they refuse to purchase AMDs microprocessors. The suit alleges that as a result of these illegal acts, AMD Japan suffered serious damages, losing all of its sales of microprocessors to Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi, while sales of microprocessors to NEC and Fujitsu also fell precipitously. Through its suit in the Tokyo District Court, AMD Japan seeks US$55 million in damages for various anticompetitive acts in addition to those covered in the scope of the JFTC Recommendation. The suit alleges that these anticompetitive acts also had the effect of interfering with AMD Japans right to engage in normal business and marketing activities. In re ATI Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation. In August and September 2005, five class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against ATI and certain of its directors and officers on behalf of shareholders who purchased ATI common shares between October 7, 2004 and on or about June 23, 2005. The claims allege that ATI and certain of its directors and officers violated United States securities laws by failing to disclose material facts and making statements that contained misrepresentations about its business and future outlook. It is alleged that as a result of the failure to disclose material facts and the alleged misrepresentations, ATIs common stock traded at artificially inflated prices until the stock price dropped on the news of ATIs third quarter results in June 2005. The claims further allege that while in possession of material undisclosed information, certain of ATIs directors and officers sold a portion of their common shares at inflated prices. On May 23, 2006, the Court dismissed one of the five actions because the plaintiff failed to serve the summons and complaint. The four remaining lawsuits were consolidated into a single action, and on September 8, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. ATI filed its Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint on December 4, 2006. On January 25, 2007, class plaintiffs filed their opposition to ATIs motion to dismiss. U.S. Consumer Class Action Lawsuits In February and March 2006, two consumer class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against ATI and three of its subsidiaries. The complaints allege that ATI had misrepresented its graphics cards as being HDCP ready when they were not, and on that basis alleged violations of state consumer protection statutes, breach of express and implied warranty, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. On April 18, 2006, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On June 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, alleging violations of Californias consumer protection laws, breach of express warranty, and unjust enrichment. On June 21, 2006, a third consumer class action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in May 2006 alleging claims that are substantially the same was transferred to the Northern District of California, and on July 31, 2006, that case was also consolidated into the consolidated action pending in the Northern District of California. ATI filed an answer to the consolidated complaint on August 7, 2006. 47 Table of Contents Department of Justice Subpoena On November 29, 2006, AMD received a subpoena for documents and information in connection with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) criminal investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. AMD entered the graphics processor business following our acquisition of ATI on October 25, 2006. The DOJ has not made any specific allegations against AMD or ATI. AMD is cooperating with the investigation. GPU Class Actions Currently approximately thirty six related antitrust actions have been filed against AMD, ATI and Nvidia Corporation, in the Northern District of California, the Central District of California, the District of Massachusetts, the Western District of Wisconsin, the District of South Carolina, the District of Kansas and the District of Vermont. According to the complaints, plaintiffs filed each of the actions after reading press reports that AMD and Nvidia had received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division in connection with the DOJs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. All of the actions appear to allege that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain, or stabilize the prices of graphics processing units and cards in violation of federal antitrust law and or state antitrust law. Further, each of the complaints is styled as a putative class action and alleges a class of plaintiffs (either indirect or direct purchasers) who purportedly suffered injury as a result of the defendants alleged conduct. The majority of the complaints propose a class period from November or December 2002 to the present. Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders during the term of such agreements. Under these agreements other parties have assumed most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4.2 million in accordance with applicable accounting rules and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty, and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various other actions that arose in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report. 48 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock (symbol AMD) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On February 16, 2007, there were 7480 registered holders of our common stock. The following table sets forth on a per share basis the high and low intra day sales prices on the New York Stock Exchange for our common stock for the periods indicated: High Low Fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 First quarter $ 42.70 $ 30.16 Second quarter 36.08 23.46 Third quarter 27.90 16.90 Fourth quarter 25.69 19.90 High Low Fiscal year ended December 25, 2005 First quarter $ 22.37 $ 14.63 Second quarter 18.34 14.08 Third quarter 24.03 16.63 Fourth quarter 30.65 20.22 We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and have no present plans to do so. Under the terms of our October 2006 Term Loan and the terms of our Indenture for the 7.75% Notes dated October 29, 2004 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee, we are limited in our ability to pay cash dividends unless we obtain the written consent of the lenders and bondholders. Specifically, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends if the aggregate amount of dividends and other restricted payments made by us since entering into the respective agreement would exceed the sum of specified financial measures including fifty percent of consolidated net income as that term is defined in the respective agreement. In addition, our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 KG is restricted by the terms of the Fab 36 Loan Agreement from paying cash dividends to us or providing loans or advances to us in certain circumstances without the prior written consent of the lenders. The information under the caption, Equity Compensation Plan Information, in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 3, 2007 (2007 Proxy Statement) is incorporated herein by reference. During the period covered by this report, we issued or sold the following equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Act. On October 25, 2006, we acquired all the outstanding shares of ATI for a combination of approximately $4.3 billion in cash, and approximately 58 million shares of our common stock. The common stock was issued pursuant Section 3(a)(10) of the Act, which provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. The Superior Court of Justice (Ontario) held a hearing regarding, among other things, the fairness of the transaction and approved the transaction. This hearing satisfied the requirements of Section 3(a)(10). We have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300 million worth of our common stock over a period of time to be determined by management. These repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. We are not required to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities pursuant to this Board authorized program. 49 Table of Contents Performance Graph Comparison of Five Year Cumulative Total Returns Advanced Micro Devices, S&P 500 Index and S&P 500 Semiconductor Index The following graph shows a five year comparison of cumulative total return on our common stock, the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Semiconductor Index from December 28, 2001 through December 31, 2006.

As a result 2006 is not fully comparable to prior periods. (2) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2005 includes the results of operations for our former Memory Products segment through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, the date that Spansion closed its IPO, through December 25, 2005 and for all of 2006 we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansions net income (loss). We include this information under the caption, Equity in net income (loss) of Spansion Inc. and other, on our consolidated statement of operations. Therefore, 2006 is not fully comparable to prior periods. (3) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2004 includes the results of operations for our former Memory Products segment for the entire year. Therefore, 2004 is not fully comparable to 2005 during which Spansions results of operations were not consolidated with our results of operations for the last five days of the fiscal year. (4) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2003 includes the results of operations of Spansion from June 30, 2003, the date of formation of Spansion LLC (formerly known as FASL LLC). Spansions results 51 Table of Contents of operations were reported as part of our former Memory Products segment. We formed Spansion LLC with Fujistu Limited on June 30, 2003 by expanding an existing manufacturing joint venture that was formed in 1993 and in which we had an ownership interest of slightly less than 50 percent. Upon the formation of Spansion LLC, our ownership interest increased to 60 percent, From June 30, 2003 through December 20, 2005 we maintained our 60 percent ownership interest, Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our interest in the manufacturing joint venture under the equity method. Therefore, consolidated statement of operations data for 2003 is not comparable to 2004, and consolidated statement of operations data for 2003 is not comparable to 2002 data. Minority interest consists primarily of the elimination of Fujitsu Limiteds share of the income (loss) of Spansion. Fujitsu held a 40 percent minority ownership interest in Spansion, prior to the IPO of Spansion Inc (Spansion Related Minority Interest). (5) Represents a write off of in process research and development in connection with the ATI acquisition. (6) Represents amortization of acquisition related intangible assets acquired as part of the ATI acquisition and charges incurred to integrate the operations of ATI with our operations. (7) In 2002, we incurred approximately $331 million of charges in connection with the 2002 Restructuring Plan. (8) Other income (expense), net, includes a charge of approximately $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (4.5% Notes) for common stock and a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of amounts outstanding under a term loan agreement among our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 30 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, and the lenders party thereto (the Fab 30 Term Loan). (9) The 2006 minority interest amount represents the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 and 13 percent related to the limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from the unaffiliated partners (Fab 36 Minority Interest); the 2005 and 2004 minority interest amount includes the Fab 36 Minority Interest and Spansion Related Minority Interest; the 2003 minority interest amount represents the Spansion Related Minority Interest. (10) Due to the dilution in our ownership interest in Spansion from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent in connection with Spansions IPO, we recorded a loss of $110 million which represents the difference between Spansions book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares owned by us. (11) The 2002 income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions. No tax benefit was recorded in 2002 on pre tax losses due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our U.S. deferred tax assets, net of U.S. deferred liabilities, in the fourth quarter, due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses in the U.S. (12) The 2006 income tax provision primarily results from current foreign taxes, plus deferred U.S. tax related to indefinite lived goodwill, and reduced by deferred foreign benefits from removing part of the valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers of Fab 36. (13) Includes long term debt and capital lease obligations, less current portion and Other long term liabilities. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, which are included in this Form 10 K. Introduction We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. During most of 2006, within the global semiconductor industry, we offered primarily: x86 microprocessors, for the commercial and consumer markets, which are used for control and computing tasks; and Embedded microprocessors for commercial, commercial client and consumer markets. As a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, we began to supply 3D graphics, video and multimedia products and chipsets for desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations, and servers as well as products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles. Therefore, since the acquisition, we have actively participated in the semiconductor graphics and chipset markets as well as in the semiconductor market for consumer electronics devices. Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Spansion Inc., on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through Spansion LLC, our former majority owned subsidiary. In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Our results of operations include sales of graphics, video, multimedia and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices from the closing date of the ATI acquisition on October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006 in two new reportable segments: (i) Graphics and Chipsets and (ii) Consumer Electronics. We are not able to provide any comparative information for these two segments because prior to the ATI acquisition, we did not participate in these markets. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10 K, including Part I, Item 1: Business; Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data; and Part II,
