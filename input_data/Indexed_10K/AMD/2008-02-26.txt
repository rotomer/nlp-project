Our Industry Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of 2 Table of Contents smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function. In order to satisfy the demand for faster, smaller and lower cost ICs, semiconductor manufacturers have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology. ICs are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers. Use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis. Use of larger wafers can contribute further to a decrease in manufacturing costs per unit and to an increase in capacity by yielding more chips per wafer. Computing Solutions The x86 Microprocessor Market A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer. It generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal indicators of CPU performance are work per cycle, or how many instructions are executed per cycle, clock speed, representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of hertz, or cycles per second, and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of CPUs, or cores, on a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed. Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Currently, microprocessors are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. While 32 bit processors have historically been sufficient, they have faced increasing challenges as new data and memory intensive consumer and enterprise software applications gain popularity. Microprocessors with 64 bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory. Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the exponential growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor manufacturers have transitioned from manufacturing single core microprocessors to also manufacturing multi core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Moreover, two or more processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of symmetrical multiprocessing is effective in both multi tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for multi threaded software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or threads, simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership. With the release of Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista and with the proliferation of applications for multimedia and gaming, grid computing and extensive enterprise databases, the demand for 64 bit computing, multi core technology and improved power management technology continues to increase. We also believe that businesses and consumers want more integrated computing solutions or platform products. A platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated platforms will bring end users improved system stability, better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency. 3 Table of Contents Microprocessor Products We currently offer single core and multi core microprocessor products for servers, workstations, notebooks and desktop PCs. Our microprocessors currently are designed with both 32 bit and 64 bit processing capabilities. We based our microprocessors on the x86 instruction set architecture and most of these processors are also based on the AMD64 technology platform with Direct Connect Architecture. The AMD64 technology platform extends the industry standard x86 instruction set architecture to 64 bit computing. Direct Connect Architecture connects an on chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. For multi core microprocessors, we integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second level cache, and L3, or third level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance. We believe this architecture, and the integrated memory controller in particular, enables substantially higher performance than traditional front side bus architectures because memory can be accessed more directly, resulting in increased bandwidth and reduced memory latencies. Our processors support HyperTransport technology, which is a high bandwidth communications interface that enables substantially higher multi processor performance and scalability than competing x86 architectures. In designing our processors, we also focus on continuously improving power management technology, or performance per watt. To that end, we offer processors that feature AMD PowerNow! technology, which we designed to reduce system level energy consumption, with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that can significantly reduce processor power consumption during idle times. We design our microprocessors to be compatible with operating system software such as the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, Linux&reg;, NetWare&reg;, Solaris and UNIX. We also designed the AMD64 architecture to enhance the security of a users computing environment by integrating security features that are designed to prevent the spread of certain viruses when enabled by the anti virus features of current versions of certain operating systems, including Linux, the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems and Solaris operating systems. Servers and Workstation Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for servers and workstations consist primarily of our quad core, dual core and single core AMD Opteron processors. A server is a device that performs services for connected clients as part of a client server architecture. They are designed to run an application or applications, often for extended periods of time with minimal human direction. Examples of servers include web servers, e mail servers, and file servers. A workstation is essentially a high end desktop, designed for technical applications such as computer aided design and digital content creation. Workstations usually offer higher performance than is normally seen on a personal computer, especially with respect to graphics, processing power, memory capacity and multitasking activity. We based our AMD Opteron processors for servers and workstations on our Direct Connect Architecture and the AMD64 technology platform, and designed them to allow simultaneous 32 bit and 64 bit computing. These processors can be used in a variety of server applications, including business processing (enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and supply chain management) and business intelligence. They can also be used in workstation applications such as engineering and digital content creation software and other information technology infrastructure applications such as intensive Web serving and messaging. Our multi core AMD Opteron processors offer improved overall performance on many applications compared to single core AMD processors by executing more operations simultaneously during each clock cycle, and by improving performance per watt, which can reduce the operational costs related to power usage. At the same time, servers based on multi core AMD Opteron processors are easier to manage because more processing capacity can be concentrated into fewer servers. For this reason, servers based on multi core processors are less costly to operate. Multi core AMD Opteron processors also allow our enterprise customers to more easily implement virtualization across their businesses. Virtualization is the use of software to allow multiple discrete operating 4 Table of Contents systems and application environments to share a single physical computer, by providing the illusion that each operating system has full control over the underlying hardware. By enabling different operating systems and applications to run on the same server, virtualization offers the benefit of consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements, which can also reduce power, cooling and system management costs. In August 2007, we introduced our quad core AMD Opteron processors. These processors incorporate four processor cores on a single die of silicon, add a 6MB shared L3 cache, and offer features designed to improve performance for virtualized application environments, as well as on floating point applications (e.g. mathematic and scientific applications). Quad core AMD Opteron processors also feature a variety of power saving technologies, including AMD CoolCore technology, which reduces energy consumption by turning off unused parts of the processor and enhanced AMD Powernow! technology, which allows each core to vary its clock frequency depending on the performance requirements of the application being supported, and dual dynamic power management, which provides an independent power supply to the cores and the memory controller. We expect to ship quad core AMD Opteron processors in more significant volumes in the first half of 2008. Our dual core AMD Opteron processors provide several new features including improved virtualization support through AMD Virtualization technology and the use of energy efficient DDR2 technology, which is memory technology used for high speed storage of working data. In addition, these processors are designed to be socket and thermally compatible with quad core AMD processors. Notebook Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for notebook PCs consist primarily of AMD Turion 64 X2, AMD Athlon 64 and mobile AMD Sempron processors. We designed our mobile processor products for high performance, longer battery life and wireless connectivity. AMD Turion 64 X2 dual core mobile technology is our most advanced dual core processor family for notebook PCs. We designed this technology to enable leading edge graphics for the more visual experience provided by the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista operating system, longer battery life, enhanced security and compatibility with the latest wireless technologies and graphics solutions. In addition, we have designed the process used to manufacture AMD Turion 64 X2 mobile technology for more thermally efficient processor operation and reduced power consumption. Desktop Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for desktop PCs consist primarily of the following tiered product brands: AMD Phenom, AMD Athlon and AMD Sempron processors. All AMD desktop microprocessors are based on AMD64 technology with Direct Connect Architecture. In November 2007, we introduced the AMD Phenom 9000 series of microprocessors. The AMD Phenom 9000 processors are true quad core processors designed for high performance desktop PCs. The true quad core design enables cores to communicate on the die rather than through a front side bus external to the processor, thereby reducing a bottleneck inherent in other competing x86 architectures. Additionally, our Direct Connect Architecture allows all four cores to have optimum access to the integrated memory controller and integrated HyperTransport links, so that performance scales well with the number of cores. This design also incorporates a shared L3 cache for quicker data access and enables end users to seamlessly upgrade from dual core systems. At the same time, we also introduced a desktop platform product codenamed Spider. The Spider platform is a combination of the AMD Phenom 9000 microprocessor and advanced chipset and graphics technologies, and is designed for enthusiasts, digital content creators and mainstream users who are seeking more immersive, visual computing experiences and who require computer systems with superior performance. The AMD Spider platform provides a scalable high definition (HD), multi GPU experience for digital entertainment and advanced multimedia productivity. It incorporates ATI PowerPlay, our power management technology that reduces the power consumption of our graphics processors, CoolnQuiet 2.0 technology, which reduces power consumption by reducing the processors clock rate and voltage when idle, Microsoft DirectX 10.1 support, a collection of industry graphics technologies designed to deliver advanced graphics capabilities on Microsoft 5 Table of Contents platforms, HyperTransport 3.0 technology, and PCI Express 2.0, a new interface that connects GPUs with the computer system and doubles the bandwidth. AMD Athlon processors are designed for advanced multitasking on mainstream desktop PCs and are currently available with single or dual core technology. AMD Athlon dual core processors are designed for users who routinely run multiple processor intensive software applications simultaneously. With AMD Athlon dual core processors, computer users are able to perform multiple tasks with uninterrupted performance, and are designed to enable systems to have the ability to simultaneously download audio files such as MP3s, record to digital media devices, check and write email, edit a digital photo and run anti virus scan software. AMD Sempron processors are designed for everyday computing and provide performance for entry productivity and entertainment software for the mainstream segment. Embedded Processor Products Our products range from low power x86 architecture based embedded processors to high performance, enterprise class, harsh environment capable x86 architecture based products. We design embedded connectivity devices to address customer needs in non PC markets where low power, Internet connectivity and or low power processing is a priority. Typically these embedded processors are used in products that require high to moderate levels of performance where key features include low cost, mobility, low power and small form factor. Our embedded microprocessor products include the AMD Geode product family. AMD Geode microprocessors are 32 bit processors based on the x86 instruction set architecture. These processors integrate functionality such as processing, system logic, graphics, audio and video decompression onto one integrated device. We also offer embedded processors based on AMD64 technology, which consists of low power versions of our AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, AMD Sempron and AMD Opteron families of products. These low power products deliver the same performance as their corresponding full power parts while offering the added benefit of reduced power consumption and thermal output. These processors are configured specifically for demanding embedded applications traditionally served by custom silicon designs. We believe these processors also offer our customers the ability to leverage the AMD64 infrastructure. In addition, a distinguishing characteristic of our AMD64 based embedded processors is our AMD64 Longevity Program. The AMD64 Longevity Program offers a select set of AMD64 processors with an extended standard availability period of five years. The extended availability period addresses the requirements of customers designing products for network, storage, blade and telecommunications servers; digital imaging; casino gaming and military and industrial controls systems. Such markets have lengthy design and qualification cycles and longer life spans in the marketplace than typical mainstream computing products. In 2007, we also introduced an embedded integrated graphics chipset solution to be used in commercial client applications to address specialized needs within a variety of industries, including computer devices such as thin clients, single board computers, industrial controllers, digital signage, point of sale terminals, commercial value clients, and access devices such as gateways and access points. Our embedded processor products, from AMD Opteron to AMD Geode, exemplify our x86 Everywhere microprocessor strategy, which is our goal for utilizing the x86 instruction set architecture to power a wide variety of devices in diverse places such as the home, office or car, in the supply chain, in storage networks, in the data center, and or in global communications networks. We believe that when a greater number of devices are standardized with an x86 based platform, end users can benefit from the ability to run their existing x86 based software on devices that interoperate with each other. This can accelerate and simplify the process of enabling faster, easier connectivity and data sharing between a wide range of products, from portable consumer electronics to PCs and servers. With our full range of embedded microprocessors, we are able to extend our x86 based product offerings to serve markets from embedded appliances to embedded server class products. 6 Table of Contents Chipset Market The chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive and CD or DVD drive. Chipsets perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Chipsets also extend the graphics, audio, video and other capabilities of computer systems. Finally, chipsets control the access between the CPU and main memory. All desktop, notebook and server PCs incorporate a chipset. In many PCs, the chipset is integrated with additional functions such as a graphics processing unit, or GPU. A GPU is a semiconductor chip that increases the speed and complexity of image resolution and color definition that can be displayed on a graphical interface, thereby improving image resolution and color definition. An integrated chipset solution is commonly known as an IGP (integrated graphics processor) chipset. Chipsets which do not integrate a graphics core are referred to as discrete chipsets. By eliminating the need for a discrete GPU, IGP chipsets offer a lower cost solution and in some circumstances can offer reduced power consumption or smaller system form factors. A majority of desktop and notebook PCs make use of IGP chipsets, while discrete chipsets are used in higher performance PCs and servers. Chipset Products Our portfolio of chipset products includes IGP and discrete chipsets targeting both the desktop and notebook PC segments. The AMD 690 family of IGP chipsets was introduced for desktop PCs in February 2007 and for notebook PCs in March 2007. These products incorporate an ATI Radeon X1200 series graphics core and directly integrate support for the High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Digital Visual Interface (DVI) digital display standards used in many flat panel monitors and televisions. We also offer a line of IGP chipsets which support Intel processors. We expect to continue shipments of our existing chipsets for Intel CPUs throughout 2008 and beyond to the extent there is demand for these products. However, we expect that sales of these products will continue to decline and will eventually cease. In November 2007, we introduced the AMD 790FX chipset and several other AMD 7 series discrete chipsets as part of the AMD Spider platform. The AMD 790FX chipset provides support for our CrossFireX multi GPU technology, which allows several GPUs to work in unison to provide enhanced graphics performance, and is optimized for use with our new AMD Phenom quad core processors. Graphics Products Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual processing in various computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs, notebook PCs and workstations. Users of these products value a rich visual experience, particularly in the high end enthusiast market where consumers seek out the fastest and highest performing visual processing products to deliver the most compelling and immersive gaming experiences. Moreover, for some consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data and communications processing machine to an entertainment platform. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing intensive multimedia content for PCs and to PC manufacturers creating more PCs designed for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content. In turn, the trend has contributed to the development of higher performance graphics solutions. The primary product of a semiconductor graphics supplier is the GPU. The GPU off loads the burden of graphics processing from the CPU. In this way, a dedicated graphics processor and CPU work in tandem to increase overall speed and performance of the system. A graphics solution can be in the form of either a stand alone graphics chip or an integrated chipset solution. Recently, to further improve graphics processing performance, semiconductor graphics suppliers have introduced multi GPU technologies which increase graphics processing speed by dividing graphics rendering and display capability among two or more graphics processors. 7 Table of Contents Graphics Products Our customers generally use our graphics to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution and color definition. Our products include 3D graphics and video and multimedia products developed for use in desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers. With each of our graphics products, we provide drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. Our latest generation of graphics and related software offer full support for the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista&reg; operating system. In addition to the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, our graphics products support Apples Mac OS X as well as Linux&reg; based applications. Discrete Desktop Products. Our discrete GPUs for desktop PCs include the ATI Radeon HD 2000 series of products which we introduced in May 2007. This product family includes the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT for the enthusiast segment of the desktop PC market, and the ATI Radeon HD 2600 series and the ATI Radeon HD 2400 series for the mainstream and value segments of the desktop PC market. The ATI Radeon 2000 series supports Microsoft DirectX 10, a new 3D application performance interface, or API. The ATI Radeon HD 2600 and ATI Radeon HD 2400 incorporate the ATI Unified Video Decoder (UVD) which enables HD DVD and Blu ray playback with low CPU and power utilization. In November 2007, we launched the ATI Radeon HD 3870 and HD 3850, which introduced next generation features such as Microsoft DirectX10.1, PCI Express 2.0 and UVD in both models, to deliver enthusiast level gaming performance at mainstream price points. These products were also our first products to be manufactured using 55 nanometer process technology, allowing for smaller die size and lower power consumption. At this time, we also announced CrossFireX, our next generation multi GPU technology. Although desktop PC manufacturers have tended to rely on IGP chipsets for graphics, we believe that discrete graphic solutions, which offer higher performance, will continue to be the preferred solution across desktop PC configurations and platforms designed for gaming enthusiasts, CAD professionals and animation as well as for application such as multimedia, photo and video editing and other graphic intensive applications. In 2007, with the introduction of Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista and Microsoft DirectX 10, the emergence of high definition (HD) video standards like HD DVD and Blu ray, and the introduction of PCI Express 2.0, end users across the spectrum are realizing the importance of graphics in a computer system. Accordingly, we believe that demand for discrete GPUs will continue to increase. Discrete Notebook Products. Our discrete GPUs for the notebook PC market include the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2000 series of products which we introduced in May 2007. When selecting a graphics solution, key considerations for notebook PC manufacturers are visual performance, power consumption, form factor and cost. This product line includes the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2600 Series for performance notebook PCs and the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2300 for the value notebooks. These GPUs incorporate UVD to enable HD DVD and Blu ray playback with low CPU usage, and hence low system power. ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2400 and ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2600 both support Microsoft DirectX 10, while ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2300 supports Microsoft DirectX 9. Home Media PC Products. Our home media PC products incorporate a wide variety of features for consumers that intend to use their PCs for multimedia applications.

We also provide products for the server market, where we leverage our graphics expertise and align our offerings to provide stability, video quality and bus architectures that our server customers desire. Consumer Electronics Products Consumer Electronics Market Video, graphics and media processors in consumer electronics products address the need for enhancing the visual experience provided by devices such as mobile phones, digital TVs and game consoles. Consumers value entertainment and communications products that can deliver an engaging multimedia experience. Accordingly, semiconductor suppliers of video, graphics and media processors strive to deliver products that improve visual realism and allow manufacturers of mobile phones, digital TVs, game consoles and other consumer electronics devices the opportunity to differentiate their products. Handheld Market. The latest generation of handheld devices, particularly mobile phones, are driving demand for more advanced media and application processors. In recent years, mobile phones have transitioned towards color displays with higher resolutions that deliver a variety of multimedia features. Manufacturers are offering functionality such as built in digital cameras and camcorders, MP3 audio playback, video playback, mobile TV reception, 3D gaming, Internet web browsing, personal navigation and advanced user interfaces in an increasing percentage of mobile phones. The availability of these multiple functions increases the opportunity to supply media processors to mobile phone manufacturers. Digital TV Market. The market for digital TVs is growing, driven in part by the transition of terrestrial broadcast television transmissions from analog to digital in many different regions throughout the world. For example, on February 18, 2009, full power television stations in the United States will stop analog broadcasting and transition to digital broadcasting. This conversion is supported by a U.S. Federal Communications Commission mandate that required electronics manufacturers to include digital tuners in all new television sets by March 2007. There is also a worldwide shift in the television industry from analog cathode ray tube, or CRT, displays to digital flat panel displays such as LCD and plasma. These flat panel displays are able to support larger screen sizes and higher resolutions. Producing the highest quality images on these advanced televisions is a key goal for television manufacturers. Video processor semiconductor solutions play an integral role in improving video image quality to enhance the user viewing experience. Game Consoles. Semiconductor graphics suppliers have leveraged their core visual and graphics processing technologies developed for the PC market by providing graphic solutions to game console manufacturers. In this market, semiconductor graphics suppliers work alongside game console manufacturers to enhance the visual experience for users of sophisticated video games. Consumer Electronics Products We continue to leverage our core technology, visual processing expertise and power management know how to meet the needs of certain consumer electronics markets. We target three categories of the consumer electronics market: (i) handheld devices, including mobile phones; (ii) digital TVs; and (iii) game consoles. Our products for consumer electronics devices include media processors used in handheld devices such as mobile phones and video processors used in digital TVs. We also license graphics core technologies to other 9 Table of Contents semiconductor manufacturers in the handheld industry. We receive royalties from game console manufacturers in connection with sales of systems that incorporate our graphics intellectual property and designs. With each of these products we provide drivers and supporting software that enable the effective use of these products by our customers. Handheld Devices.

Also in February 2007, we announced a new business focused on developing and licensing leading edge graphics core technologies to semiconductor manufacturers throughout the handheld industry. To that end, we entered into graphics licensing agreements with manufacturers of handset chipsets and handset devices. The integration of our graphic core technologies will enable these customers to provide multimedia functionality combined with HD video and audio playback capabilities. Digital TVs. As television broadcasters in North America and other parts of the world transition their analog television signals to digital transmissions, we believe increased consumer interest in digital TV will spur demand for more advanced systems. Digital transmission standards provide significant advantages compared to analog standards, including greater picture clarity and resolution as well as opportunities for more channels, e commerce and enhanced TV viewing. We offer two groups of products that target two major silicon blocks inside an integrated digital TV: the digital video receiver and the decoder. An integrated digital TV is one where a digital receiver and digital video decoder are integrated inside the TV rather than externally, such as via a set top box. Our AMD Xilleon and Theater product lines are used in integrated digital TVs to demodulate and decode digital broadcast signals. AMD Xilleon products also provide video, graphics and audio processing. The drivers and supporting software that we provide with our digital TV products allow deployment in multiple worldwide markets with either customer designed applications or AMD supplied Customer Application Ready Design (CARD) software applications.

We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEMs: multi nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi nationals and regional accounts are our core OEM customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktop and notebook PCs, PC motherboards and consumer electronics products such as mobile phones and digital TVs. Under our standard terms and conditions, OEMs do not have a right to return our products other than pursuant to the standard limited warranty. In 2007, Hewlett Packard Company accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues. Sales to Hewlett Packard consisted primarily of products from our Computing Solutions segment. In addition, one handset manufacturer accounted for more than 30 percent of the revenue attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment and one game console provider accounted for a significant portion of revenue attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment. Moreover, three customers accounted for more than 35 percent of the revenue attributable to our Graphics segment. A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Third Party Distributors Our authorized distributors resell to sub distributors and mid sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. AIB Manufacturers and System Integrators We strive to establish and broaden our relationships with add in board manufacturers, or AIB manufacturers. We offer component level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board level products using our technology to SIs and at retail. We also work directly with our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. Competition Generally, the IC industry is intensely competitive. Products typically compete on product quality, power consumption, reliability, speed, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance 12 Table of Contents improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our manufacturing costs. Competition in the Microprocessor Market Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels market power and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, and adversely affect our margins and profitability. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating, and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue. Competition in the Embedded Processor Market With respect to our embedded processors, our principal competitors are Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, NEC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Raza Microelectronics, Inc., Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and VIA Technologies, Inc. We expect competition in the market for these devices to increase as our principal competitors focus more resources on developing low power embedded processor solutions. 13 Table of Contents Competition in the Chipset Market In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. PC manufacturers are increasingly choosing to use integrated chipsets, particularly for notebook computers, over discrete GPUs because integrated chipsets can cost significantly less than discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel Corporation manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market. Should Intel leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market and sell its integrated chipsets, it could place our integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage, such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, for example, Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Competition in the Graphics Market In the graphics market, our competitors include discrete graphics suppliers. Intel has stated that it intends to re enter the discrete GPU market. This could shrink the total available market for certain of our discrete GPUs. Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but lesser financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market. Competition in the Consumer Electronics Market In the semiconductor market for consumer electronics products we have different competitors in each of our product categories. With respect to our products for handheld devices, we have three primary categories of competitors: vendors of baseband processors, vendors of applications processors and vendors of media co processors. The baseband processor provides the basic voice and communication processing functionality in mobile phones. For certain value categories of the market, baseband processor vendors are integrating the multimedia processing required for feature rich mobile phones. Baseband processor vendors incorporating this basic level of graphics processing include MediaTek Inc., Agere Systems Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm Incorporated and Texas Instruments Incorporated. Another category of competitor, application processor vendors, target manufacturers of high end feature and smart phones whose products require large amounts of general purpose processing capability as well as multimedia processing. These vendors include Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Nvidia Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., STMicroelectronics N.V. and Texas Instruments Incorporated. The third category of competitor provides dedicated processors to drive a high level of multimedia functionality. This approach is most comparable to our strategy, and our competitors in this category include Core Logic Incorporated, Telechips Inc., MTEK Vision Co. Ltd., Nvidia Corporation, Renesas Technology Corp and Imagination Technologies Ltd. With respect to our products for digital TVs, our primary competitors include Broadcom Corporation, MediaTek Inc., Trident Microsystems, NEC Corporation, NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics N.V., as well as in house semiconductor development divisions at companies such as LG Electronics, Inc., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., Samsung and Toshiba Corporation. In the new panel processor market, we compete with Micronas USA, Inc., NXP Semiconductors, Toshiba Corporation, Trident Microsystems, MediaTek Inc., Pixelworks Inc. and in house development divisions of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Sony. In the game console category, we compete primarily against Nvidia Corporation. Other competitors include Intel Corporation and IBM. We license graphics core technologies to other semiconductor manufacturers in the handheld industry. Our primary competitors in this area are Imagination Technologies Ltd. and ARM Inc. 14 Table of Contents Research and Development We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance per watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. With respect to graphics and chipsets and products for consumer electronics devices, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever changing demands of the PC and consumer electronics industries on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors. Our research and development expenses for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Research and development expenses for 2006 and 2007 included ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006 through December 29, 2007. For more information, see Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. We conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this agreement, we jointly develop new process technologies, including 45 nanometer, 32 nanometer, 22 nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also includes laboratory based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die to package connection technologies. We pay fees to IBM for joint development projects. The actual amounts we pay to IBM are dependent upon the number of partners, including us and IBM, engaged in related development projects under the agreement. In addition, we agreed to pay IBM specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. Bumping wafers is one of the final stages of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test. For more information on the fees paid or payable to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees Unconditional Purchase Commitments, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. Under the agreement, our joint development relationship continues through December 31, 2011. Our agreement with IBM may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under our agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300 millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y. 15 Table of Contents We conduct research and development activities for our graphics products, chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, India, Finland and China. Due to the rapid pace of technological change in the graphics industry, our strategy is to focus on developing the newest generation of products that meet market and customer requirements on a timely basis so as to meet each market window. Manufacturing, Assembly and Test Facilities We own and operate five manufacturing facilities, of which two are microprocessor wafer fabrication facilities and three are microprocessor assembly and test facilities. We developed an approach to manufacturing called Automated Precision Manufacturing, or APM. APM comprises a suite of automation, optimization and real time data analysis technologies which automate the way decisions are made within our fabrication facilities. We use APM during volume manufacturing and process technology transitions, and believe APM enables greater efficiency, higher baseline yields, better speed binning and faster yield learning. We have complemented APM with a program called ADVANCE, which is based on Lean manufacturing principles (originating principally from the automotive industry), and helps to identify and institutionalize efficiency and productivity gains. During 2007, our microprocessor manufacturing was conducted at the facilities described in the chart below. These facilities are the cornerstone of our flexible capacity growth plan, which focuses on bringing the right amount of capacity online at the right time through ongoing, incremental increases in total output. Facility Location Wafer Size(diameter inmillimeters) PrincipalProductionTechnology(in nanometers) ApproximateClean RoomSquareFootage Dresden, Germany Fab 30 200 90 263,000 Fab 36 300 65 150,000 During 2007, we manufactured our microprocessor products at Fab 30 primarily on 90 nanometer process technology. We fully converted to and ramped production on 65 nanometer process technology at Fab 36 by mid 2007, as planned. Our goal is to ramp manufacturing using 45 nanometer technology in the first half of 2008. In 2007, we expanded capacity in Fab 36, and completed the addition of a new bump and test facility. Bump and test is the final stage of the wafer manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and final test. We also began the process of converting Fab 30 from a 200 millimeter to a 300 millimeter manufacturing facility. The last 200 millimeter wafer in Fab 30 was completed in November 2007. We anticipate that after being fully converted to a 300 millimeter facility, Fab 30 (which will be renamed Fab 38) will be able to handle a maximum of approximately 20,000 300 millimeter wafer starts per month. Another facet of our flexible capacity growth strategy involves working with third party foundries, and to this end, we have sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing pursuant to which Chartered is an additional manufacturing source for our AMD64 based microprocessors. We also have foundry arrangements with third parties for the production of our embedded processors, chipset products and graphics products and products for consumer electronics devices. In connection with our potential new 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York, we may give notice to the State of New York Urban Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) to proceed with this project anytime between January 2008 and July 2009. However, we are not obligated to commence construction, and our decision regarding proceeding with the construction is dependent on business conditions and market demand. 16 Table of Contents Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by the ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are described in the chart set forth below: Facility Location ApproximateManufacturingArea SquareFootage Activity Penang, Malaysia 206,000 Assembly Singapore 380,000 Test, Mark & Packaging Suzhou, China 44,000 Test, Mark & Packaging Some assembly and final testing of our microprocessor and embedded processor products is performed by subcontractors in the United States and Asia. With respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, we have strategic relationships with three semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and Chartered. Currently, we are in volume production in TSMCs and UMCs 300 millimeter fabrication facilities. As of December 29, 2007, our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices were manufactured on 55 , 65 , 80 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 or 180 nanometer process technologies at third party foundries. Smaller process geometries can lead to gains in graphics processing performance, lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs. From the foundry, wafers for our graphics products are delivered to our test, assembly and packaging partners including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Group, Amkor, King Yuan Electronics, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATS Chippac, who package and test the final application specific integrated circuit. We outsource board level graphics product manufacturing to third party manufacturers. These include Celestica, Foxconn and PC Partner with locations in China. Our facility in Markham, Ontario, Canada is primarily devoted to prototyping for new graphics product introductions. Raw Materials Our manufacturing processes require many raw materials, such as silicon wafers, IC packages, mold compound, substrates and various chemicals and gases, and the necessary equipment for manufacturing. We obtain these materials and equipment from a large number of suppliers located throughout the world. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 29, 2007, we had more than 7,000 patents in the United States and over 1,700 patent applications pending in the United States, including more than 600 patents in the United States and 400 patent applications in the United States that we acquired from ATI. In 17 Table of Contents certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration thereof, is or would be material to our business. In connection with the formation of Spansion LLC as of June 2003 and the closing of Spansion Inc.s initial public offering, or IPO, in December 2005, we and Fujitsu Limited transferred to Spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement, or IPCAAMA. Under the IPCAAMA, Spansion became the owner or joint owner with each of us and Fujitsu, of specified patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and technology. The patents that we transferred included patents and patent applications covering Flash memory products and technology, the processes necessary to manufacture Flash memory products, and the operation and control of Flash memory products. We reserved rights, on a royalty free basis, to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to our affiliates and successors in interest. We also have the right to use the jointly owned intellectual property for our internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with our non competition obligations to Spansion. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Fujitsu whereby each party was granted a non exclusive license under certain of the other partys respective semiconductor related patents. This patent cross license agreement terminates on June 30, 2013, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days notice following a change of control of the other party. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Spansion. The patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date prior to the termination of the patent cross license agreement. The agreement will automatically terminate on the later of June 30, 2013 or the date we sell our entire equity interest in Spansion. The agreements may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group. In addition, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the patent cross license agreement with Intel which was effective as of January 1, 2001. Under this agreement we granted each other a non exclusive license under each partys patents for the manufacture and sale of semiconductor products worldwide. We pay Intel Corporation a royalty for certain licensed microprocessor products sold by us or any AMD affiliate anywhere in the world. The license applies to each partys patents that have a first effective filing date during the capture period, which is the period from January 1, 2001 through January 1, 2010. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and does not correct the breach within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days written notice in the event of a filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or any adjudication thereof, the filing of any petition seeking reorganization under any law relating to bankruptcy, the appointment of a receiver, the making of any assignment for the benefit of creditors, the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the other partys business, or in the event of a change of control. For purposes of our agreement with Intel, change of control means a transaction or a series of related transactions in which (i) one or more related parties who did not previously own at least a 50 percent interest in a party obtain at least a 50 percent interest in such party, and, in the reasonable business judgment of the other party, such change in ownership will have a material effect on the other partys business, or (ii) a party acquires, by merger, acquisition of assets or otherwise, all or any portion of another legal entity such that either the assets or market value of such party after the close of such transaction are greater than one and one third of the assets or market value of such party prior to such transaction. Backlog We manufacture and sell standard lines of products. Consequently, a significant portion of our sales are made from inventory on a current basis. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. These orders or agreements may be revised or canceled 18 Table of Contents without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice and experience and the fact that substantially our entire order backlog is cancelable, we do not believe that such agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Employees As of December 29, 2007, we had approximately 16,420 employees. Environmental Regulations Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, and or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal or storage, or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. We have management systems in place to identify and ensure compliance with such requirements and have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel also manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of the business. Intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Moreover, computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets, particularly for notebooks, because they cost significantly less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream PCs. 19 Table of Contents Also, Intel has stated that it intends to reenter the discrete GPU market. Intels actions could shrink the total available market for certain of our graphics products. Intel could also take other actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. If our graphics products do not successfully address the discrete GPU and integrated chipset markets, our business could be materially adversely affected. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of Intels competitors. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel launched its quad core multi chip module processors during the fourth quarter of 2006. We commenced initial shipments of our first quad core products for servers in August 2007 and for desktop PCs in November 2007. However, we did not ship significant volumes of these products in 2007, but we expect to ship in more significant volumes in the first half of 2008. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures. In 2008, we plan to make approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures. Our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. 20 Table of Contents Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. As of December 29, 2007, we had $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. During 2007, we incurred substantial losses that have had a negative impact on cash balances. During 2007, net cash used in operating activities was $310 million and net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures. If we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects, we could be materially adversely affected. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of December 29, 2007, we had consolidated debt of $5.3 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2012 (7.75% Notes) contains various covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments if a default or an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; 21 Table of Contents create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from the sale of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate, merge or sell assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met. In addition, our Fab 36 term loan facility agreement among our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, as borrower, and a consortium of banks lead by Dresdner Bank AG, as lenders, dated April 21, 2004 (Fab 36 Term Loan), contains restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on the ability of AMD Fab 36 KG and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy these covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement. Our loan agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (5.75% Notes), 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes) and 7.75% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustees under the indentures governing our 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes or 7.75% Notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we are unable to maintain our cost management efforts, our business could be materially adversely affected. During 2007, we took a number of actions to manage our expenses and realign our cost structure. We anticipate that during the first quarter of 2008, our operating expenses will increase by approximately five percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our expenses at appropriately reduced levels, and if we are unable to do so, our goal of achieving profitability could fail to materialize in accordance with our expectations. In addition, if these reductions are not effectively managed, we may experience unanticipated effects from these reductions causing harm to our business and customer relationships. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc. The success of our acquisition of ATI depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of ATI with the businesses of AMD, and failure to realize these anticipated benefits could cause our business to be materially adversely affected. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon our successful integration of ATIs operations. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: retaining key employees; bridging possible differences in cultures and management philosophies; 22 Table of Contents consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and information technology systems; coordinating sales and marketing functions; preserving our customer, supplier, ecosystem partner and other important relationships; aligning and executing on new product roadmaps; minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns; and coordinating geographically separate organizations. We cannot assure you that our integration of ATI will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipated. For example, it is possible that as a result of the acquisition, previous ATI customers of discrete GPUs may decide to purchase our competitors graphics products for use with their computer systems that incorporate Intel platforms, or that ecosystem partners will cease doing business with us because they view the former ATI operations as competitive with portions of their business. Any inability to integrate successfully could have a material adverse effect on us. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed our annual impairment analysis with respect to the goodwill and, based on the outcome of that analysis, we also evaluated our acquisition related intangible assets for impairment. We determined that goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of ATI was impaired, and incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion, as well as an impairment charge of $349 million related to acquisition related identifiable intangible assets acquired from ATI. These charges resulted in a reduction of the carrying values of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets as recorded on our balance sheet. They are based on an updated long term financial outlook for the former ATI operations that is lower than previously calculated. However, actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in further impairment of goodwill. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive. We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product designs, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion, and we anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Moreover, in connection with the ATI acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years. However, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to achieve planned investments in research and development or to otherwise maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive. We have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. We anticipate that under this agreement, we will pay fees to IBM of approximately $400 million in connection with joint development projects between 2008 and 2011. 23 Table of Contents If this agreement were to be terminated, we would have to substantially increase our research and development activities internally, which could significantly increase our research and development costs, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with required features and performance levels that provide value to our customers and support and coincide with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. For example, in the third quarter of 2007, we commenced initial shipments of our quad core AMD Opteron processors, but our initial production ramp of these processors was slower than we anticipated because we had to undertake design and process tuning. We expect to ship in more significant volumes during the first half of 2008. Delays in developing or qualifying new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. Moreover, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain overall corporate average selling prices. If we are unable to introduce new products or launch new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting these reductions in average selling prices of existing products, our revenues, inventories, gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to design and introduce new graphics products in a timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property. In the design and development of new products and graphics product enhancements, we rely on third party intellectual property such as software development tools. Historically, ATI has experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of its products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us. If the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top five customers accounted for over 40 percent of our total revenue in 2007. Moreover, historically a significant portion of ATIs revenues were derived from sales to a small number of customers, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues from our 24 Table of Contents graphics and consumer electronics businesses in the future. For example, during 2007, one handset manufacturer accounted for over 30 percent of the revenue of our Consumer Electronics segment. During this same period, three customers accounted for over 35 percent of the revenue of our Graphics segment. If one of our top microprocessor, graphics or consumer electronics customers decided to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers were to materially reduce its operations or its demand for our products, we would be materially adversely affected. For example, during 2007, the handset manufacturer referenced above purchased significantly less of our products than in the previous year. This decline contributed to lower unit shipments of our products for consumer electronics devices and negatively impacted net revenue for our Consumer Electronics segment in 2007. Moreover, this handset manufacturer is considering divesting its handset business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. Our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including those of our customers; and excess production capacity. For example, in 2001 and 2002 we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry. If the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future, we would be materially adversely affected. The demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our microprocessor business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs and servers. Industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Depending on the growth rate of computers sold, sales of our products may not grow and may even decrease. If demand for computers is below our expectations, we could be materially adversely affected. The business we acquired from ATI is also dependent upon the market for mobile, desktop and workstation PCs, the consumer electronics market for digital TVs, handheld devices, such as multimedia enabled mobile phones, and game consoles. A market decline in any of these industries could cause the demand for our products to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may not grow, and may even decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 25 Table of Contents The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive, and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We expect competition to intensify due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and aggressive pricing by competitors. We believe that the main factors that determine our competitiveness are product quality, power consumption, reliability, speed, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We expect that competition will intensify in these markets and our competitors products may be less costly, provide better performance or include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. With respect to our graphics products, Intel and Nvidia are our principal competitors. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. Competitive pressures could adversely impact the demand for our products, which could harm our revenue and gross margin. If we fail to continue to improve the efficiency of our supply chain in order to respond to increases or changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we must continually improve the management of our supply chain by synchronizing the entire supply chain, from sourcing through manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment. As we continue to grow our business, acquire new OEM customers and strengthen relationships with existing OEM customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because OEMs tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time frames in which they require delivery of these products. We have recently experienced challenges related to the logistics of selling our products across a diverse set of customers and geographies and delivering these products on a timely basis. If we fail to continue to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and adjust our operations in response to future increases or changes in OEM demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings. In addition, we continue to work with other third parties to obtain graphics chips in order to provide our customers with a greater choice of technologies to best meet their needs. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intels proprietary bus interface protocol. If we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from designers and manufacturers of motherboards and chipsets, our business would be materially adversely affected. Our acquisition of ATI could exacerbate this problem because we design and supply a significantly greater amount of graphics products ourselves. Doing so could cause third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers to be less willing to do business with us or to support our products out of a perceived risk that we will be less willing to support their products or because we may compete with them. As a result, these third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers could forge relationships, or strengthen their existing relationships, with our competitors. If the designers, manufacturers and suppliers of graphics chips, motherboards, and other components decrease their support for our product offerings and increase their support for the product offerings of our competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. 26 Table of Contents If we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against Intel, our business may be materially adversely affected. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intels Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, which we refer to collectively as Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. Our complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of Intels customers in dealing with AMD. Also, on June 30, 2005, our subsidiary in Japan, AMD Japan K.K., filed an action in Japan against Intel K.K. in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted Intels motion to dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007 adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to develop evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing AMD from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. The Court also set a trial date of April 27, 2009. If our antitrust lawsuits against Intel are ultimately unsuccessful, our business, including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market, could be materially adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse effect on us. There may be situations in which our microprocessor manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products. Our inability to provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could result in an adverse effect on our relationships with customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In November 2004, we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing whereby Chartered agreed to become a contract manufacturer for our AMD64 based microprocessors. Although Chartered has begun production, the ability of Chartered to continue to ramp production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control, including Chartereds ability to continue to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis. In addition, we have slowed the conversion of Fab 30 into a 300 millimeter wafer manufacturing facility. If we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our microprocessor products, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements, we could be materially adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents We rely on third party foundries and other contractors to manufacture certain products. We rely on independent foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corp. to manufacture our graphics and chipset products. Chartered Semiconductor manufactures some of our microprocessor products and products for consumer electronics devices. We also rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our high end graphics boards. Independent contractors also perform the assembly, testing and packaging of these products. We obtain these manufacturing services for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product. Accordingly, our graphics and consumer electronics businesses depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices. We cannot assure you that these manufacturers will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice. We must have reliable relationships with our wafer manufacturers and subcontractors to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. If we move production of our products to new manufacturers or if current manufacturers implement new process technology or design rules, any transition difficulties may result in lower yields or poorer performance of our products. Because it could take several quarters to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative foundries or contractors. Other risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturers include reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and cost, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors, reduced ability to manage inventory and parts, and exposure to foreign countries and operations. With respect to Chartered, we rely on their ability to implement our technology for manufacturing our AMD64 based processors at their facilities on a timely basis. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of wafers, our ability to meet customer demand for our graphics and consumer electronics businesses may be adversely affected and this could have a material adverse effect on us. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessor manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers that we use to manufacture our microprocessor products. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessor products. Similarly, certain non proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources and are often subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us. 28 Table of Contents Industry overcapacity could cause us to under utilize our microprocessor manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us. Both we and our competitor, Intel, have added significant capacity in recent years, both by expanding capacity at wafer fabrication facilities and by transitioning to more advanced manufacturing technologies. In the past, capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market, which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us. It is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve, making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity. If our target markets do not grow as we anticipate, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities, which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products for which demand is lower than we anticipate. In addition, during periods of industry overcapacity, customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity, which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements. Many of our costs are fixed. Accordingly, during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products, our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. When this occurs, our operating results are materially adversely affected. If the demand for our microprocessor products is not consistent with our increased expectations, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities or we may not fully utilize the reserved capacity at Chartereds foundry. This may have a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our microprocessor products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. We continually modify manufacturing processes and transition to more advanced manufacturing process technologies in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, delays in the development or implementation of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs or force us to allocate our reduced product supply among our customers, which could potentially harm our customer relationships, reputation, revenue and gross profit. Improving our microprocessor manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to: develop advanced product and process technologies; successfully transition to advanced process technologies; ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities; and achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies. During periods when we are implementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier 29 Table of Contents than we do. Our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses if revenues do not increase proportionately. Similarly, the operating results of our graphics and consumer electronics businesses are dependent upon achieving planned semiconductor manufacturing yields. Our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured at independent foundries, but we have the responsibility for product design and the design and performance of the tooling required for manufacturing. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from either design or process technology failures. In addition, yield problems require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer and sometimes the customer as well. The offshore location of our principal manufacturers compounds these risks, due to the increased effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. We cannot assure you that we or our foundries will identify and fix problems in a timely manner, and achieve acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability, in cooperation with our independent foundries, to achieve planned production yields for these products could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, failure to reach planned production yields over time could result in us not having sufficient product supply to meet demand and or higher production costs and lower gross margins. This could materially adversely affect us. The accounting method for convertible debt securities with net share settlement, like the 6.00% Notes, will be subject to change. In September 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, exposed for comment a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14 a, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (including partial cash settlement). This proposed FSP would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments, including our 6.00% Notes. Under the proposed new rules, for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. The effect of the proposed new rules for our 6.00% Notes is that the equity component would be included in the paid in capital portion of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 6.00% Notes. Higher interest expense would result by recognizing accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 6.00% Notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the 6.00% Notes. If issued as proposed, the final FSP would provide final guidance effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, would not permit early application, and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In November 2007, the FASB announced it expects to begin its redeliberations of the proposed FSP in January 2008. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proposed effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 will be retained. We cannot predict the exact accounting treatment that will be imposed (which may differ from the foregoing description) or when any change will be finally implemented. However, if the final FSP is issued as exposed, we expect to have higher interest expense starting in the period of adoption due to the interest expense accretion and, if the retrospective application provisions of the proposed FSP are retained in the final FSP, our prior period interest expense associated with the 6.00% Notes would be higher than previously reported interest expense due to retrospective application. Conversion of the 5.75% Notes and 6.00% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. The conversion of some or all of the 5.75% Notes and the 6.00% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Although the capped call transaction that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes is expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes, the 30 Table of Contents conversion of the 6.00% Notes could still have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds $42.12, which is the cap price of the capped call. Similarly, the conversion of the 5.75% Notes could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds $20.13, the conversion price of the 5.75% Notes. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 5.75% Notes or 6.00% Notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. The capped call transaction may affect the value of our common stock. We entered into a capped call transaction in connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes. The capped call transaction is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock at the time of exercise, as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 6.00% Notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the 6.00% Notes. If, however, the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction, as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction, the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited, which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction. In connection with hedging the capped call transaction, the counterparty or its affiliates: may enter into or unwind various derivatives and or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the 6.00% Notes). These activities could have the effect of decreasing the price of our common stock during any observation period related to a conversion of the 6.00% Notes. The counterparty or its affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions in relation to the capped call transaction from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 6.00% Notes by purchasing and selling our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. In particular, such hedging modifications are likely to occur during any observation period related to a conversion of the 6.00% Notes, which may have a negative effect on the value of the consideration received upon conversion of the 6.00% Notes. In addition, we intend to exercise options we hold under the capped call transaction whenever the 6.00% Notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options, the counterparty or affiliates thereof expect to sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the observation period, if any, for the converted 6.00% Notes. If we elect to cash settle the capped call transaction, which we are permitted to do subject to certain conditions, it is likely the counterparty or its affiliates will sell an even greater number of shares. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 6.00% Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 6.00% Notes. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. In addition, software drivers sold with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. 31 Table of Contents If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us. We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenues, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury, and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect us. In addition, because we sell directly to consumers, we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our receipt of royalty revenues is dependent upon the success of third party products. Our graphics technology for the game console market is being used in the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft&reg; Xbox 360 game consoles. The only revenues that we receive from these technology platforms are in the form of non recurring engineering revenues, as well as royalties paid to us by Nintendo and Microsoft based upon the market success of their products. Accordingly, our royalty revenues will be directly related to the sales of these products. We anticipate royalties in future years resulting from our agreements with Nintendo and Microsoft. However, we have no control over the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Microsoft and 32 Table of Contents we cannot assure you that sales of those products will achieve expected levels in the current or future fiscal years. Consequently, the revenues from royalties expected by us from these technology platforms may not be fully realized, and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our entry into consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties. We sell products for the consumer electronics market, including for digital TVs and color mobile phones. There are a significant number of competitors targeting this market. In addition, as the telecommunications, cable and consumer electronics industries and their suppliers undergo a period of convergence, we expect that competition will increase in these markets. Our ability to succeed in these consumer markets is subject to a number of uncertainties, including acceptance of our graphics and multimedia processors, the development of new technologies sufficient to meet market demand, the need to develop customer relationships, different sales strategies and channels, new and different industry standards from those in the PC market and changing strategic alliances. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in this market. If we are unable to successfully introduce products and compete in this market, we could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions, including physical distribution of our products, and co source some information technology services. We rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for some of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we rely on a third party in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations, the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for some facilities could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure. However, if the costs related to administration, communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect, then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements. Generally, our customers may cancel orders more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty, while customers of products for consumer electronics devices may cancel orders by providing 90 days prior advance notice. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. For example, customers who are concerned about potential supply shortages may double order products by ordering more product from us 33 Table of Contents than they ultimately need. Subsequently, these customers could cancel all or a portion of these orders when they realize they have sufficient supply. This behavior would increase our uncertainty regarding demand for our products and could materially adversely affect us. With respect to our graphics products, we do not have any commitment or requirements for minimum product purchases in our sales agreement with AIB customers, upon whom we rely to manufacture, market and sell our desktop GPUs. These sales are subject to uncertainty because demand by our AIBs can be unpredictable and susceptible to price competition. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Moreover, PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on profit margins. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in average selling prices, and or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to estimate customer demand for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors taking aggressive pricing actions. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products. Our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets. Accordingly, we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. However, in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. For example, all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, 34 Table of Contents Malaysia and Singapore. In addition, our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are manufactured, assembled and tested by independent third parties in the Asia Pacific region and inventory related to those products is stored there, particularly in Taiwan. We also have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated revenue was 87 percent in 2007, and China was one of our largest and fastest growing markets. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in achieving headcount reductions; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health or safety, natural disasters or general economic factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, potentially longer payment cycles, potentially increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. For example, Chinas economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years, and China was one of our largest and fastest growing markets. A decline in economic conditions in China could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions. If economic conditions decline, whether in China or worldwide, we could be materially adversely affected. The occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, directly or indirectly, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. 35 Table of Contents Recently, there has been widespread concern over the instability of the credit markets and the current credit market conditions on the economy. If the economy weakens or slips into recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro and the Canadian dollar. For example, some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our German subsidiaries, AMD Saxony and AMD Fab 36 KG, are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, some of our expenses and debt are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. The value of the U.S. dollar has fallen significantly, leading to increasingly unfavorable currency exchange rates on foreign denominated expenses. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as payroll and equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights 36 Table of Contents granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and we would be materially adversely affected. We are party to litigation, including intellectual property litigation, and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, ATI, is party to a consumer class action, among other litigation matters. Additionally, in November 2006 we received a subpoena for documents and information in connection with the U.S. Department of Justices criminal investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. In addition, AMD and our subsidiaries, ATI, AMD US Finance, Inc. and 1252986 Alberta ULC are defendants in a consolidated action in which the plaintiffs are seeking to certify a class action to obtain injunctive relief and damages for alleged violations of federal antitrust law, and for alleged violations of certain state antitrust and consumer protection statutes, related to graphics processing units and cards. We also sell products to consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified, or third parties may bring actions against us, based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities. Our operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with 37 Table of Contents such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of lead free products may be less favorable compared to lead based products or that the transition to lead free products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. All of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. The independent foundries we use to manufacture our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices are located in the Asia Pacific region and inventory is stored there, particularly in Taiwan. Many of our assembly, testing and packaging suppliers for our graphics products are also located in southern Taiwan. On September 22, 1999, Taiwan suffered a major earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and disrupted the operations of these manufacturing suppliers and contributed to a temporary shortage of graphics processors. Additional earthquakes, fires or other occurrences that disrupt our manufacturing suppliers may occur in the future. To the extent that the supply from our independent foundries or suppliers is interrupted for a prolonged period of time or terminated for any reason, we may not have sufficient time to replace our supply of products manufactured by those foundries. Moreover, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. 38 Table of Contents Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material effect on our cash, goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of ATI, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. For example, the Canadian Revenue Agency, or CRA, is auditing ATI for the years 2000 2004 with respect to transactions between ATI and its subsidiaries. The audit has been completed and is currently in the review process. We could be subject to significant tax liability as well as a loss of certain tax credits and other tax attributes as a result of the CRA audit. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have not received any written comments that were issued more than 180 days before December 29, 2007, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES At December 29, 2007, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 3.6 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices. Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture company that owns this facility. We occupy five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 265,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. In some cases, we lease all or a portion of the land on which our facilities are located. We lease approximately 218,000 square feet of land in Singapore and 270,000 square feet of land in Suzhou, China for our microprocessor and test facilities. In addition, Fab 30 and Fab 36 are located on approximately 9.7 million square feet of land. Of this amount, Fab 36 owns approximately 5.4 million square feet, and both the facility and the land are encumbered by a lien securing the obligations of AMD Fab 36 KG, the entity that owns the Fab 36 assets, under its EUR 700 Million Term Loan Facility Agreement with a consortium of banks in connection with the Fab 36 project (Fab 36 Loan Agreements). See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fab 36 Term Loan and Guarantee and Fab 36 Partnership Agreements. As of December 29, 2007, we also leased approximately 3.1 million square feet of space for engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative use, including a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2018. We also have approximately 185,000 square feet of building space that is currently vacant. We continue to have lease obligations with respect to this space that expire at various dates through 2011. We are actively marketing this space for sublease. Spansion Inc. leases approximately 71,000 square feet from us. 39 Table of Contents We are also in the process of building a new campus for design and administrative functions on approximately 58 acres in Austin, Texas. The campus will consist of approximately 825,000 square feet and is concentrated to approximately 33 of the available 58 acres. We expect that the new Austin campus will be fully occupied by mid 2008. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy, or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that, except as discussed above, the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In addition to ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, AMD or its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, ATI, were party to the following material legal proceedings. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and should any of these actions or proceedings against us be successful, we may be subject to significant damages awards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. AMD and AMDISS v. Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, Civil Action No. 05 441, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On June 27, 2005, AMD filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, collectively Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. The complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that in effect limit Intels customers ability and or incentive to deal with AMD. The complaint alleges anti competitive business practices, including: Forcing major customers into Intel exclusive deals in return for outright cash payments, discriminatory pricing or marketing subsidies conditioned on the exclusion of AMD; Forcing other major customers into partial exclusivity agreements by conditioning rebates, allowances and market development funds on customers agreement to severely limit or forego entirely purchases from AMD; Establishing a system of discriminatory and retroactive incentives triggered by purchases at such high levels as to have the intended effect of denying customers the freedom to purchase any significant volume of processors from AMD; Establishing and enforcing quotas among key retailers, effectively requiring them to stock overwhelmingly or exclusively computers with Intel microprocessors, and thereby artificially limiting consumer choice; and Forcing PC makers and technology partners to boycott AMD product launches or promotions. AMD has requested the following findings and remedies: A finding that Intel is abusing its market power by forcing on the industry technical standards and products that have as their main purpose the handicapping of AMD in the marketplace; A finding that Intel is wrongfully maintaining its monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and treble damages to AMD in an amount to be proven at trial, pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15(a); A finding that Intel has made secret payments and allowance of rebates and discounts, and that Intel secretly and discriminatorily extended to certain purchasers special services or privileges, all in 40 Table of Contents violation of California Business & Professions Code 17045, and treble damages for AMDs resulting lost profits in an amount to be proven at trial; A finding that Intel has intentionally interfered with valuable business relationships of AMD to AMDs economic detriment and damages to AMD in an amount to be proven at trial for its resulting losses, as well as punitive damages, as permitted by law; Injunctive relief prohibiting Intel from engaging in any further conduct unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act or Section 17045 of the California Business and Professions Code; An award to AMD of such other, further and different relief as may be necessary or appropriate to restore and maintain competitive conditions in the x86 microprocessor market; and An award of attorneys fees and costs. Intel filed its answer on September 1, 2005. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted the motion of Intel Corporation to dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007 adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to introduce evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing AMD from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. The Court also set an immovable trial date of April 27, 2009. The discovery process is ongoing. Other Related Proceedings On June 30, 2005, our Japanese subsidiary, AMD Japan K.K., or AMD Japan, filed an action in Japan against Intel Corporations Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, or Intel K.K., in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. Through its suit in the Tokyo High Court, AMD Japan seeks $50 million in damages, following on the Japan Fair Trade Commissions (JFTC) findings in its March 8, 2005 Recommendation, or the JFTC Recommendation, that Intel K.K. committed violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. The JFTC Recommendation concluded that Intel K.K. interfered with AMD Japans business activities by providing large amounts of funds to five Japanese PC manufacturers (NEC, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi) on the condition that they refuse to purchase AMDs microprocessors. The suit alleges that as a result of these illegal acts, AMD Japan suffered serious damages, losing all of its sales of microprocessors to Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi, while sales of microprocessors to NEC and Fujitsu also fell precipitously. Through its suit in the Tokyo District Court, AMD Japan seeks $55 million in damages for various anticompetitive acts in addition to those covered in the scope of the JFTC Recommendation. The suit alleges that these anticompetitive acts also had the effect of interfering with AMD Japans right to engage in normal business and marketing activities. U.S. Consumer Class Action Lawsuits In February and March 2006, two consumer class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against ATI and three of its subsidiaries. The complaints allege that ATI had misrepresented its graphics cards as being HDCP ready when they were not, and on that basis alleged violations of state consumer protection statutes, breach of express and implied warranty, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. On April 18, 2006, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On June 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, alleging violations of Californias consumer protection laws, breach of express warranty, and unjust enrichment. On June 21, 2006, a third consumer class action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in May 2006 41 Table of Contents alleging claims that are substantially the same was transferred to the Northern District of California, and on July 31, 2006, that case was also consolidated into the consolidated action pending in the Northern District of California. ATI filed an answer to the consolidated complaint on August 7, 2006. On September 28, 2007, the Court entered an order denying Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification without prejudice, granting plaintiffs additional time to conduct class discovery and granting plaintiffs certain fees and costs. The discovery process is ongoing. Department of Justice Subpoena On November 29, 2006, AMD received a subpoena for documents and information in connection with the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, criminal investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards, with a focus on the business that AMD acquired from ATI on October 26, 2006. AMD entered the graphics processor business following our acquisition of ATI on October 25, 2006. The DOJ has not made any specific allegations against AMD or ATI. AMD is cooperating with the investigation. GPU Class Actions Currently over fifty related antitrust actions have been filed against AMD, ATI and Nvidia Corporation, all of which were consolidated and transferred to the Northern District of California in the action In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation including twenty eight actions in the Northern District of California, eleven in the Central District of California, two in Massachusetts, one in the Western District of Wisconsin, three in South Carolina, one in Vermont, one in Kansas, two in the District of Columbia, one in the Eastern District of New York, one in the Eastern District of Arkansas, one in South Dakota, one in the Middle District of Tennessee and one in the Eastern District of Tennessee. According to the complaints, plaintiffs filed each of the actions after reading press reports that AMD and Nvidia had received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division in connection with the DOJs investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. All of the actions appear to allege that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain, or stabilize the prices of graphics processing units and cards in violation of federal antitrust law and or state antitrust law. Further, each of the complaints is styled as a putative class action and alleges a class of plaintiffs (either indirect or direct purchasers) who purportedly suffered injury as a result of the defendants alleged conduct. Class plaintiffs (direct and indirect) filed amended consolidated complaints in June 2007. The amended consolidated complaints proposed a class period from December 2002 to the present. On September 27, 2007, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss. Pursuant to the courts order, plaintiffs filed motions to amend their complaints on October 11, 2007, and defendants filed oppositions to plaintiffs motions on October 18, 2007. On November 7, 2007, the court granted plaintiffs motion in part and denied it in part and ordered plaintiffs immediately to file their amended complaints in conformity with the courts order. On November 7 and November 8, 2007, plaintiffs (indirect and direct purchasers) filed their amended complaints. In addition to AMD and ATI, the amended complaints named AMD US Finance, Inc. and 1252986 Alberta ULC as defendants. On November 27 and 28, 2007, the defendants filed their answers to the indirect and direct purchasers amended complaints. The discovery process in ongoing. The court has scheduled a jury trial to begin on January 12, 2009. Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible 42 Table of Contents parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.5 million in accordance with applicable accounting rules and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty, and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various other actions that arose in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4.

As a result, 2007 is not fully comparable to prior periods. (2) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2006 includes the operations of ATI for the period from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. As a result, 2006 is not fully comparable to 2007 or to prior periods. (3) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2005 includes the results of operations for our former Memory Products segment through December 20, 2005. From December 21, 2005, the date that Spansion Inc., our former majority owned subsidiary, closed its IPO through December 25, 2005 and all of 2006, we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansions net income (loss). We include this information under the caption, Equity in net income (loss) of Spansion Inc. and other, on our consolidated statements of operations. In September 2007, as a result of our reduced ownership interest in, and the loss of our ability to exercise significant influence over, Spansion, we ceased applying the equity method of accounting and began accounting for this investment as available for sale marketable securities under FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Therefore, 2005, 2006 and 2007 are not fully comparable to each other or to prior periods. 46 Table of Contents (4) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2004 includes the results of operations for our former Memory Products segment for the entire year. Therefore, 2004 is not fully comparable to 2005, during which Spansions results of operations were not consolidated with our results of operations for the last five days of the fiscal year, or to 2006 and 2007. (5) Consolidated statement of operations data for 2003 includes the results of operations of Spansion LLC from June 30, 2003, the date of its formation. Prior to this, Spansion LLCs results of operations were reported as part of our former Memory Products segment. We formed Spansion LLC with Fujitsu Limited on June 30, 2003 by expanding an existing manufacturing joint venture that was formed in 1993 and in which we had an ownership interest of slightly less than 50 percent. Upon the formation of Spansion LLC, our ownership interest increased to 60 percent. From June 30, 2003 through December 20, 2005 we maintained our 60 percent ownership interest. Prior to June 30, 2003, we accounted for our interest in the manufacturing joint venture under the equity method. Therefore, consolidated statement of operations data for 2003 is not comparable to 2004. (6) Represents a write off of in process research and development in connection with the ATI acquisition. (7) Represents amortization of acquisition related intangible assets acquired in connection with the ATI acquisition and charges incurred to integrate the operations of ATI with our operations. (8) Represents impairment charges recorded to write down the carrying value of ATI related goodwill and acquired intangible assets. See Part II, Item 7 MD&A ATI Acquisition. (9) The increase in interest expense from $126 million in 2006 to $367 million in 2007 consisted of interest on new outstanding debt, including our 6.00% Notes, 5.75% Notes, Fab 36 Term Loan and October 2006 Term Loan. (10) Other income (expense), net, includes a charge of approximately $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 for common stock and a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of amounts outstanding under a term loan agreement among our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 30 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, and the lenders party thereto. (11) The 2006 and 2007 minority interest amounts represent the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 and 13 percent related to the limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from the unaffiliated partners (Fab 36 Minority Interest); the 2005 and 2004 minority interest amount includes the Fab 36 Minority Interest and Spansion related minority interest; the 2003 minority interest amount represents the Spansion related minority interest. Minority interest consists primarily of the elimination of Fujitsu Limiteds share of the income (loss) of Spansion LLC. Fujitsu Limited held a 40 percent minority ownership interest in Spansion LLC, prior to the IPO of Spansion Inc. (12) In 2005 we recorded a loss of $110 million due to the dilution in our ownership interest in Spansion from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent in connection with Spansions IPO. This represents the difference between Spansions book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares owned by us. In September 2007, as a result of our reduced ownership interest in, and loss of our ability to exercise significant influence over, Spansion, we ceased applying the equity method of accounting and began accounting for this investment as available for sale marketable securities under FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Following our quarterly impairment review, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $111 million in 2007. See Note 4, Spansion Inc., in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (13) The 2007 income tax provision primarily results from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays. (14) The 2006 income tax provision primarily results from current foreign taxes, plus deferred U.S. tax related to indefinite lived goodwill, and reduced by deferred foreign benefits from removing part of the valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers of Fab 36. (15) Total assets decreased by $1.6 billion from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the impairment charge for ATI acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets. Total assets increased by $5.9 billion from 2005 to 2006 primarily as the result of the acquisition of ATI. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
