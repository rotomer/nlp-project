Our Industry Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function. In order to satisfy the demand for faster, smaller and lower cost ICs, semiconductor manufacturers have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology. ICs are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers. Use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis. Use of larger wafers can contribute further to a decrease in manufacturing costs per unit and to an increase in capacity by yielding more chips per wafer. Computing Solutions The x86 Microprocessor Market A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer. It generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal indicators of CPU performance are work per cycle, or how many instructions are executed per cycle, clock speed, representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of hertz, or cycles per second, and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of CPUs, or cores, on a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed. Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Currently, microprocessors are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. Microprocessors with 64 bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory. Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the exponential growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies have transitioned from designing and developing single core microprocessors to also designing and developing multi core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Moreover, multiple processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of symmetrical multiprocessing is effective in both multi tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for multi threaded software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or threads, simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership. 5 Table of Contents We also believe that businesses and consumers want more integrated computing solutions or platform products. A platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated platforms bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and energy efficiency while enabling faster time to market for systems manufacturers. Microprocessor Products We currently offer single core and multi core microprocessor products for servers, workstations, notebooks and desktop PCs. Our current microprocessors are designed with both 32 bit and 64 bit processing capabilities. We based our microprocessors on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMDs Direct Connect Architecture. AMD Direct Connect Architecture connects an on chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. For multi core microprocessors, we integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second level cache, and L3, or third level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance. We believe this architecture, and the integrated memory controller in particular, enables substantially higher performance than traditional front side bus architectures because memory can be accessed more directly, resulting in increased bandwidth and reduced memory latencies. Our processors support HyperTransport technology, which is a high bandwidth communications interface that enables substantially higher multi processor performance and scalability than competing x86 architectures. In designing our processors, we also focus on continuously improving power management technology, or performance per watt. To that end, we offer processors that feature AMD PowerNow! and CoolnQuiet technology, which are designed to reduce system level energy consumption, with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that can significantly reduce processor power consumption during idle times. Our microprocessors are designed to be compatible with operating system software such as the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, Linux&reg;, NetWare&reg;, Solaris and UNIX. We also designed AMDs Direct Connect Architecture to enhance the security of a users computing environment by integrating security features that are designed to prevent the spread of certain viruses when enabled by the anti virus features of current versions of certain operating systems, including Linux, the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems and Solaris operating systems. In 2008, we developed a number of integrated computing solutions in the form of computing platforms. Our platforms include microprocessors, graphics processing units, or GPUs, chipsets and core software. We have launched the following platforms, which are discussed in more detail below: AMD Business Class, an initiative dedicated to developing AMD processor based commercial desktop and notebook platforms designed specifically for businesses, the Puma platform for notebooks, the Yukon platform for ultrathin notebooks and the Dragon platform for desktop PCs. Server and Workstation Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for servers and workstations consist primarily of our quad core and dual core AMD Opteron processors. A server is a system that performs services for connected clients as part of a client server architecture. They are designed to run an application or applications, often for extended periods of time with minimal human direction. Examples of servers include web servers, e mail servers, database services, file servers and print servers. A workstation is a high end PC, designed for technical applications such as computer aided design and digital content creation. Workstations usually offer higher performance than is normally seen on a PC, especially with respect to graphics, processing power, memory capacity and multitasking activity. AMD Opteron processors for servers and workstations with Direct Connect Architecture are designed to enable simultaneous 32 bit and 64 bit computing. These processors can be used in a variety of server applications, including business processing (enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and supply chain management) and business intelligence. They can also be used in workstation applications such 6 Table of Contents as engineering and digital content creation and other information technology infrastructure applications such as intensive Web serving, virtualization and messaging. AMD Opteron processors also allow enterprise customers to efficiently implement virtualization across their businesses. Virtualization is the use of software to allow multiple discrete operating systems and application environments to share a single physical computer by providing the illusion that each operating system has full control over the underlying hardware. By enabling different operating systems and applications to run on the same server, virtualization offers the benefit of consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements, which can also reduce power, cooling and system management costs. In November 2008, we introduced 45 nanometer quad core AMD Opteron processors. These processors incorporated four processor cores on a single die of silicon and added a 6MB shared L3 cache. The increased cache helps increase the speed of memory intensive applications. Quad core AMD Opteron processors offer improved overall performance on many different applications compared to the dual core AMD Opteron processors by executing more operations simultaneously during each clock cycle and by improving performance per watt, which can reduce the operational costs related to power usage. Quad core AMD Opteron processors also feature improved virtualization performance and a variety of power saving technologies, including AMD CoolCore technology, which we designed to reduce energy consumption by turning off unused parts of the processor when they are idle, enhanced AMD PowerNow! technology, which we designed to allow each core to vary its clock frequency depending on the performance requirements of the application being supported, and dual dynamic power management, which provides an independent power supply to the cores and the memory controller. Notebook Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for notebook PCs consist of AMD Turion X2 Ultra, AMD Turion X2, mobile AMD Athlon, mobile AMD Sempron and the AMD Athlon Neo processors. We designed our mobile processor products for high performance, longer battery life and wireless connectivity. AMD Turion X2 Ultra dual core mobile processors are our most advanced dual core processor family for notebook PCs. We designed this technology to enable leading edge graphics for the more visual experience provided by the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista operating system, longer battery life, and enhanced security and compatibility with the latest wireless technologies and graphics solutions. In addition, the process used to manufacture AMD Turion X2 Ultra processors results in a more thermally efficient processor and reduced power consumption. In June 2008, we launched the Puma platform, which was our code name for our mainstream notebook platform. The Puma platform incorporates the AMD Turion X2 Ultra dual core mobile processor for advanced multi tasking, the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3000 Series of graphics processors for advanced 3D graphics and the AMD 7 Series chipset with ATI Radeon HD 3200 integrated graphics. Our Puma platform products offer enhanced high definition, or HD, visual performance with full 1080p playback capability as well as wireless solutions that provide enhanced range and rapid data transfer and power management technologies that maximize battery life. In January 2009, we launched the Yukon platform, which was our code name for our ultrathin notebook platform. The Yukon platform incorporates the AMD Athlon Neo processor with ATI Radeon X1250 integrated graphics and ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3410 discrete graphics. The Yukon platform offers a complete PC experience at lower price points. Desktop Microprocessors. Our microprocessors for desktop PCs consist primarily of the following tiered product brands: AMD Phenom II, AMD Phenom, AMD Athlon and AMD Sempron processors. All AMD desktop microprocessors are based on AMD Direct Connect Architecture. In March 2008, we introduced the AMD Phenom X3 8000 series triple core processors designed for gamers and digital media enthusiasts at mainstream prices. AMD Phenom triple core processors can improve 7 Table of Contents performance over dual core processors on single threaded and multi threaded applications and can scale with the same applications that scale with quad core processors. In April 2008 we introduced commercial desktop platforms, branded as AMD Business Class technology. AMD Business Class technology features AMD Athlon X2 dual core processors and AMD Phenom triple and quad core processors, AMD 7 Series chipsets, as well as optional ATI Radeon HD 3000 series discrete graphics. Systems based on AMD Business Class technology can also feature CoolnQuiet 2.0 technology and ATI PowerPlay technology. AMD Business Class technology can help enable Energy Star&reg; 4.0 compliance for low power consumption, low heat and noise and the enablement of small form factors. In January 2009, we introduced the 45 nanometer AMD Phenom II 9000 series of microprocessors. The AMD Phenom II 9000 processors are true quad core processors designed for high performance desktop PCs. The true quad core design enables cores to communicate on the die rather than through a front side bus external to the processor, thereby reducing a bottleneck inherent in other competing x86 architectures. Additionally, our Direct Connect Architecture allows all four cores to have optimum access to the integrated memory controller and integrated HyperTransport links, so that performance scales well with the number of cores. This design also incorporates a shared L3 cache for quicker data access and enables end users to upgrade from dual core systems. In addition, AMD Phenom II microprocessors also feature CoolnQuiet 3.0 technology that is designed to enhance energy efficiency. At the same time, we also introduced a desktop platform product codenamed Dragon. The Dragon platform is a combination of the AMD Phenom II X4 microprocessor, the ATI Radeon HD 4800 series graphics processor and the AMD 7 Series chipset. The Dragon platform provides enthusiasts, gamers and other demanding users with an affordable system capable of delivering a graphic intensive gaming experience. The Dragon platform works with existing DDR2 memory infrastructures, which is memory technology used for high speed storage of working data, and is designed to work with the upcoming DDR3 memory that is transitioning into the marketplace. We designed the AMD Athlon processors for advanced multitasking on mainstream desktop PCs, and they are currently available with single or dual core technology. AMD Athlon dual core processors are designed for users who run software applications, such as productivity applications, multimedia applications and basic content creation, simultaneously. With AMD Athlon dual core processors, for example, an end user may be able to perform multiple tasks with uninterrupted performance. In addition, AMD Athlon dual core processors, are designed to enable systems to have the ability to simultaneously download audio files such as MP3s, record to digital media devices, check and write email and edit a digital photo, all without compromising performance. AMD Sempron processors are designed for everyday computing and provide performance for entry productivity and entertainment software for the mainstream segment. Embedded Processor Products Our embedded products range from low power x86 architecture based embedded processors to high performance, enterprise class, harsh environment capable x86 architecture based products. We design embedded connectivity devices to address customer needs in PC adjacent markets such as network attached storage, telecommunications and networking equipment, internet access devices and other similar applications. Typically these embedded processors are used in products that require high to moderate levels of performance where key features include low cost, mobility, low power and small form factor. We offer embedded processors based on AMD Direct Connect Architecture technology, which consist of low power versions of our AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, AMD Sempron and AMD Opteron families of products. These low power products deliver the same performance as their corresponding full power parts while offering the added benefit of reduced power consumption and thermal output. We configured these processors specifically 8 Table of Contents for demanding embedded applications traditionally served by custom silicon designs. In addition, a distinguishing characteristic of our AMD Direct Connect Architecture based embedded processors is our AMD Longevity Program. The AMD Longevity Program offers a select set of AMD processors with an extended standard availability period of five years. The extended availability period addresses the requirements of customers designing products for network, storage, blade and telecommunications servers; digital imaging; casino gaming and military and industrial controls systems. These markets have lengthy design and qualification cycles and longer life spans in the marketplace than typical mainstream computing products. Our embedded microprocessor products also include the AMD Geode product family. In 2008, we introduced 65 nanometer low power dual AMD Athlon embedded processors for the AM2 socket, which we designed to be compatible with certain pervious generation AMD single core processors. We also released Quad Core AMD Opteron embedded processors in both standard efficiency and high efficiency which are socket compatible with certain previous generation AMD dual core processors. Additionally, we introduced embedded processors in ball grid array packaging, which provide a small footprint and lower height for smaller form factor system designs. Our embedded processor products exemplify our x86 Everywhere microprocessor strategy, which is our goal for utilizing the x86 instruction set architecture to power a wide variety of devices in diverse places such as the home, office or car, in the supply chain, in storage networks, in the data center, and or in global communications networks. We believe that when a greater number of devices are standardized with an x86 based platform, end users can benefit from the ability to run their existing x86 based software on devices that interoperate with each other. This can accelerate and simplify the process of enabling faster, easier connectivity and data sharing between a wide range of products, from portable consumer electronics to PCs and servers. With our full range of embedded microprocessors, we are able to extend our x86 based product offerings to serve markets from embedded appliances to embedded server class products. Chipset Market The chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive and CD or DVD drive. Chipsets perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Chipsets also extend the graphics, audio, video and other capabilities of computer systems. All desktop, notebook and server PCs incorporate a chipset. In many PCs, the chipset is integrated with additional functions such as a GPU. An integrated chipset solution is commonly known as an IGP (integrated graphics processor) chipset. Chipsets that do not integrate a graphics core are referred to as discrete chipsets. By eliminating the need for a discrete GPU, IGP chipsets offer a lower cost solution and in some circumstances can offer reduced power consumption or smaller system form factors. A majority of desktop and notebook PCs make use of IGP chipsets, while discrete chipsets are used in higher performance PCs and servers. Chipset Products Our portfolio of chipset products includes IGP and discrete chipsets targeting both the desktop and notebook PC segments. In March 2008, we introduced the AMD 780 Series chipset designed for significant enhancements in gaming and high definition experiences for mainstream PC customers. In June 2008, we introduced the AMD 7 Series chipsets for notebooks including the AMD 780G chipset with ATI Radeon HD 3200 integrated graphics. These chipsets directly integrate support for the High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Digital Visual Interface (DVI) digital display standards used in many flat panel monitors and televisions. 9 Table of Contents Graphics Products Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual processing in various computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs, notebook PCs and workstations. Users of these products value a rich visual experience, particularly in the high end enthusiast market where consumers seek out the fastest and highest performing visual processing products to deliver the most compelling and immersive gaming experiences. Moreover, for some consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data and communications processing machine to an entertainment platform. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing intensive multimedia content for PCs and to PC manufacturers creating more PCs designed for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content. In turn, the trend has contributed to the development of higher performance graphics solutions. The primary product of a semiconductor graphics supplier is the GPU. The GPU off loads the burden of graphics processing from the CPU. In this way, a dedicated GPU and CPU work in tandem to increase overall speed and performance of the system. A graphics solution can be in the form of either a stand alone graphics chip or an integrated chipset solution. Recently, to further improve graphics processing performance, semiconductor graphics suppliers have introduced multi GPU technologies that increase graphics processing speed by dividing graphics rendering and display capability among two or more graphics processors. Graphics Products Our customers generally use our graphics to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution and color definition. Our products include 3D graphics and video and multimedia products developed for use in desktop and notebook PCs, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers. With each of our graphics products, we provide drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. Our latest generation of graphics products and related software offer full support for the Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista&reg; operating system. In addition to the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of operating systems, our graphics products support Apples Mac OS X as well as Linux&reg; based applications. Discrete Desktop Products. Our discrete GPUs for desktop PCs include the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products which we introduced in June 2008. This product family includes the ATI Radeon HD 4800 series for the enthusiast segment of the desktop PC market as well as the ATI Radeon HD 4600 series, ATI Radeon HD 4500 series and the ATI Radeon HD 4300 series for the mainstream and value segments of the desktop PC market. The ATI Radeon 4000 series supports Microsoft DirectX 10, a 3D application performance interface, or API. The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products incorporate the ATI Unified Video Decoder (UVD) which enables HD DVD and Blu ray playback with low CPU and power utilization. Although desktop PC manufacturers have tended to rely on IGP chipsets for graphics, we believe that discrete graphic solutions, which offer higher performance, will continue to be the preferred solution across desktop PC configurations and platforms designed for gaming enthusiasts, CAD professionals and animation as well as for application such as multimedia, photo and video editing and other graphic intensive applications. With the availability of Microsoft&reg; Windows Vista and Microsoft DirectX 10, HD video standards like Blu ray and the availability of PCI Express 2.0, end users across the spectrum are realizing the importance of graphics in a computer system. Discrete Notebook Products. Our discrete GPUs for the notebook PC market include the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3000 series of products which we introduced in January 2008.

We also provide products for the server market, where we leverage our graphics expertise and align our offerings to provide stability, video quality and bus architectures that our server customers desire. Game Consoles. Semiconductor graphics suppliers have leveraged their core visual and graphics processing technologies developed for the PC market by providing graphic solutions to game console manufacturers. In this market, semiconductor graphics suppliers work alongside game console manufacturers to enhance the visual experience for users of sophisticated video games. We leverage our core visual processing technology into the game console market. Our customized GPUs process the graphics in the Microsoft&reg; Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii and Nintendo GameCube videogame consoles. Marketing and Sales We sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives in both domestic and international markets pursuant to non exclusive agreements. Our sales arrangements generally operate on the basis of product forecasts provided by the particular customer, but do not typically include any commitment or requirement for minimum product purchases. We primarily use binding purchase orders, sales order acknowledgments, and contractual agreements as evidence of our sales arrangements. Our agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as payment terms, warranties and indemnities for issues specific to our products. We generally warrant that microprocessor products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Subject to certain exceptions, we generally offer a three year limited warranty to end users for microprocessor products that are commonly referred to as processors in a box, a one year limited warranty to direct purchasers for all other microprocessor products that are commonly referred to as tray microprocessor products, and a one year limited warranty to direct purchasers of embedded processor products. We have offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of tray microprocessor products who have written agreements with us and target their computer systems at the commercial and or embedded markets. 11 Table of Contents We generally warrant that graphics and chipsets will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one year, beginning on shipment of such products to our customers. We generally warrant that ATI branded PC workstation products will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of three years, beginning on shipment of such products to our customers. Generally, our microprocessor and embedded processor customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a penalty. Under our standard terms and conditions, graphics and chipset customers may also cancel orders by providing 30 days prior written notice to us without incurring a penalty. We market and sell our microprocessor and embedded processor products under the AMD trademark. Our desktop PC product brands for microprocessors are AMD Phenom, AMD Phenom II, AMD Athlon, and AMD Sempron. Our Notebook PC brands for microprocessors are AMD Turion, AMD Athlon (including the recently released AMD Athlon Neo) and AMD Sempron. Our server and workstation brand for microprocessors is AMD Opteron. We also sell low power versions of our AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and AMD Sempron processors as embedded processor solutions. We market and sell our chipsets under the AMD trademark. However, if the chipset contains a graphics core, this core is marketed under the ATI trademark. We market and sell GPUs for the consumer and workstation markets under the ATI trademark. Our product brands for workstation are ATI FirePro, ATI FireGL, and ATI FireMV. Our product brand for the consumer and non workstation commercial graphics market is ATI Radeon. We market GPUs for the consumer electronics markets under the AMD trademark. We also have the AMD LIVE! brand through which we promote our entertainment platform solutions for desktop and notebook PCs as well as film, broadcast and music professional artists that use AMD technology. We promote our gaming platforms for desktop and notebook PCs under the AMD Game! brand, and our platforms engineered for business related applications and users under the AMD Business Class brand. We market our products through our direct marketing and co marketing programs. In addition, we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers or third parties, including market development programs, pursuant to which we may provide product information, training, marketing materials and funds. Under our marketing development programs, eligible customers can use market development funds as partial reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products, subject to meeting defined criteria. OEM customers may qualify for market development funds based on purchases of eligible products. Customers Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and third party distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers and OEMs. Our graphics products customers include the foregoing as well as add in board manufacturers, or AIB manufacturers. Customers of our chipset products consist of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. Our sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet the needs of our customers. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products in order to assist in optimizing product compatibility. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. 12 Table of Contents Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEMs: multi nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi nationals and regional accounts are our core OEM customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktop and notebook PCs, and PC motherboards. Under our standard terms and conditions, OEMs do not have a right to return our products other than pursuant to the standard limited warranty. In 2008, Hewlett Packard Company accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues. Sales to Hewlett Packard consisted primarily of products from our Computing Solutions segment. In addition, four customers accounted for approximately 45 percent of the net revenue attributable to our Graphics segment. A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Third Party Distributors Our authorized distributors resell to sub distributors and mid sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. AIB Manufacturers and System Integrators We strive to establish and broaden our relationships with AIB manufacturers. We offer component level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board level products using our technology to system integrators, or SIs, and at retail. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. Competition Generally, the IC industry is intensely competitive. Products typically compete on product quality, power consumption, reliability, performance, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our manufacturing costs. Competition in the Microprocessor Market Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels market power and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the 13 Table of Contents microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, integrated graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, in some cases, are essentially distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating, and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue. Competition in the Chipset Market In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. PC manufacturers are increasingly choosing to use integrated chipsets, particularly for notebook computers, over discrete GPUs because integrated chipsets can cost significantly less than discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel Corporation manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market. Competition in the Graphics Market In the graphics market, our competitors include integrated graphics and discrete graphics suppliers. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Moreover, computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets, particularly for notebooks, because they cost less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream PCs. Also, Intel has stated that it intends to reenter the discrete GPU market. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. 14 Table of Contents Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but lesser financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market. In the game console category, we compete primarily against Nvidia Corporation. Other competitors include Intel Corporation and IBM. Research and Development We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance per watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. With respect to graphics, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever changing demands of the PC industry on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors. Our research and development expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. However, research and development expenses for 2006 are not comparable to prior years because they included ATIs research and development expenses only from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. For more information, see Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. We conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, India and China. In 2008, we conducted our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this Joint Development Agreement or JDA, we jointly conducted development activities on new process technologies, including 45 nanometer, 32 nanometer, 22 nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also included laboratory based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die to package connection technologies. We paid fees to IBM for joint development projects and we agreed to pay IBM royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. Bumping wafers is one of the final stages of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test. For more information on the fees paid to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A Contractual Cash Obligations and Guarantees Unconditional Purchase Commitments. As part of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, upon consummation of the transactions, we and The Foundry Company intend to enter into a Wafer Supply Agreement pursuant to which 15 Table of Contents The Foundry Company will provide certain foundry services to us. In August, 2008, we, on behalf of The Foundry Company, extended our JDA with IBM through December 31, 2015 and added 32 nanometer and 22 nanometer bulk Industry Standard technology projects to the existing SOI High Performance development and research projects as part of the strategy to develop the manufacturing technology for a broader potential Foundry Company customer base. The JDA will be assigned to The Foundry Company upon consummation of The Foundry Company manufacturing joint venture transaction. Manufacturing, Assembly and Test Facilities During 2008, we owned and operated five manufacturing facilities. Our microprocessor manufacturing was conducted at the facilities described in the chart below. Facility Location Wafer Size (diameter inmillimeters) Principal Production Technology (in nanometers) Approximate Clean RoomSquareFootage Dresden, Germany Fab 38 300 65 263,000 Fab 36 300 65,45 150,000 During 2008, we manufactured our microprocessor products at Fab 36 primarily on 65 nanometer process technology. At the same time, we also began the transition to 45 nanometer process technology at Fab 36, which we expect to be completed by mid 2009. The full conversion of Fab 38 to 300 millimeter was delayed; rather Fab 38 was used to provide incremental capacity to Fab 36. We have sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing pursuant to which Chartered is an additional manufacturing source for our microprocessors. We also have foundry arrangements with third parties for the production of our embedded processors, chipset products and graphics products. With respect to our graphics and chipset products, we have strategic relationships with three semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and Chartered. Currently, we are in volume production in TSMCs and UMCs 300 millimeter fabrication facilities. As of December 27, 2008, our graphics and chipsets were manufactured on 55 , 65 , 80 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 or 180 nanometer process technologies at third party foundries. Smaller process geometries can lead to gains in graphics processing performance, lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs. We are currently in the process of qualifying 40 nanometer process technology for certain products and expect to release these products in the second half of 2009. We outsource board level graphics product manufacturing to third party manufacturers. These include Foxconn and PC Partner with locations in China. Our facility in Markham, Ontario, Canada is primarily devoted to prototyping for new graphics product introductions. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we would purchase substantially all of our microprocessor products from The Foundry Company pursuant to the terms of the Wafer Supply Agreement. We would be able to use another foundry company as a second source for certain of our quarterly microprocessor product wafer requirements and may source additional amounts from such foundry company to the extent The Foundry Company is unable to deliver products to us sufficient to meet our material customer commitments. In addition, once The Foundry Company establishes a 32 nanometer qualified process, we would purchase from The Foundry Company, where competitive, specified percentages of our GPU requirements, which percentage is expected to increase over a five year period. We agreed not to sell, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets related to GPU products and related technology to any third party without The Foundry Companys consent, unless the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Wafer 16 Table of Contents Supply Agreement, including its minimum purchase obligations, where competitive, with respect to GPU products. After reviewing forecasts provided by us, as agreed by the parties, The Foundry Company would allocate such additional capacity sufficient to produce our microprocessor product volumes set forth in the rolling, binding forecasts that we provide. The parties would establish capacity requirements in advance for GPU products. The Foundry Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to fill any capacity allocated to but unutilized by us with production for third parties so as to offset and reduce our fixed cost reimbursement obligations to The Foundry Company; provided that such efforts will not be required if there exists any unutilized capacity that has not been allocated to us. At our request, The Foundry Company will also provide sort services to us on a product by product basis. The price for microprocessor products will be related to the percentage of our microprocessor specific total cost of goods sold. The price for GPU products will be determined by the parties when The Foundry Company is able to begin manufacturing GPU products for us. The Wafer Supply Agreement would terminate no later than February 2024. The Wafer Supply Agreement may also be terminated if and when a business plan deadlock with The Foundry Company exists and ATIC elects to enter into a transition period pursuant to the Funding Agreement. The Foundry Company will agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the Wafer Supply Agreement. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the Wafer Supply Agreement, but our purchase commitments to The Foundry Company will no longer apply. We currently own and operate three microprocessor assembly and test facilities. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are described in the chart set forth below: Facility Location ApproximateManufacturingArea SquareFootage Activity Penang, Malaysia 206,000 Assembly Singapore 380,000 Test, Mark & Packaging Suzhou, China 44,000 Test, Mark & Packaging Some assembly and final testing of our microprocessor and embedded processor products is performed by subcontractors in the United States and Asia. Wafers for our graphics products are delivered from the third party foundry to our test, assembly and packaging partners, which include Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Group, Amkor, King Yuan Electronics, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATS Chippac, who package and test the final application specific integrated circuit. Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 27, 2008, we had more than 7,000 patents in the United States and over 1,900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration thereof, is or would be material to our business. In connection with the formation of Spansion LLC as of June 2003 and the closing of Spansion Inc.s initial public offering, or IPO, in December 2005, we and Fujitsu Limited transferred to Spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement, or IPCAAMA. Under the IPCAAMA, Spansion became the owner or joint owner with each of us and Fujitsu, of 17 Table of Contents specified patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and technology. The patents that we transferred included patents and patent applications covering Flash memory products and technology, the processes necessary to manufacture Flash memory products, and the operation and control of Flash memory products. We reserved rights, on a royalty free basis, to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to our affiliates and successors in interest. We also have the right to use the jointly owned intellectual property for our internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with our non competition obligations to Spansion. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Fujitsu whereby each party was granted a non exclusive license under certain of the other partys respective semiconductor related patents. This patent cross license agreement terminates on June 30, 2013, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days notice following a change of control of the other party. We also have a patent cross license agreement with Spansion. The patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date prior to the termination of the patent cross license agreement. The agreement will automatically terminate on the later of June 30, 2013 or the date we sell our entire equity interest in Spansion. The agreements may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we intend to enter into a Patent Cross License Agreement pursuant to which we and The Foundry Company would grant to the other a non exclusive license under patents filed by a party (or are otherwise acquired by a party) within a certain number of years following the effective date of the Patent Cross License Agreement. Under the agreement all of our issued patents and pending patent applications (other than patents and applications owned by ATI Technologies ULC and its wholly owned subsidiaries) will be divided between us. The Foundry Company will own its allocation of patents and applications subject to pre existing rights, licenses or immunities granted to third parties relating to such patents and applications. The patents and patent applications to be owned by each party after the division will be licensed to the other party pursuant to the Patent Cross License Agreement. In addition, we intend to enter into a Non Patent Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Agreement, where we would assign to The Foundry Company all of our right, title and interest in technology and non patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the manufacture, sorting and or intermediate (WIP) testing of semiconductor products. We will retain technology and non patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the design and or post delivery testing of semiconductors. Technology and non patent intellectual property rights used both in the manufacture, sorting and or intermediate (WIP) testing of semiconductor products and in the design and or post delivery testing of semiconductor products will be owned jointly by us and The Foundry Company. In addition, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the patent cross license agreement with Intel which was effective as of January 1, 2001. Under this agreement we granted each other a non exclusive license under each partys patents for the manufacture and sale of semiconductor products worldwide. We pay Intel a royalty for certain licensed microprocessor products sold by us or any AMD affiliate anywhere in the world. The license applies to each partys patents that have a first effective filing date during the capture period, which is the period from January 1, 2001 through January 1, 2011. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and does not correct the breach within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days written notice in the event of a filing by the other party of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or any adjudication thereof, the filing of any petition seeking reorganization under any law relating to bankruptcy, the appointment of a receiver, the making of any assignment for the benefit of creditors, the institution of any proceedings for the liquidation or winding up of the other partys business, or in the event of a change of control. For purposes of our agreement with Intel, change of control means a transaction or a series of related transactions in which (i) one or more related parties who did not 18 Table of Contents previously own at least a 50 percent interest in a party obtain at least a 50 percent interest in such party, and, in the reasonable business judgment of the other party, such change in ownership will have a material effect on the other partys business, or (ii) a party acquires, by merger, acquisition of assets or otherwise, all or any portion of another legal entity such that either the assets or market value of such party after the close of such transaction are greater than one and one third of the assets or market value of such party prior to such transaction. Backlog We sell standard lines of products. Consequently, a significant portion of our sales are made from inventory on a current basis. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. These orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice and experience and the fact that substantially our entire order backlog is cancelable, we do not believe that such agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Employees As of December 27, 2008, we had approximately 14,700 employees. In connection with the sale of certain handheld assets to Qualcomm in January 2009, approximately 170 employees have accepted employment with Qualcomm. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, approximately 2800 employees will transfer to The Foundry Company. Environmental Regulations Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, and or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal or storage, or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. We have management systems in place to identify and ensure compliance with such requirements and have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intels significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. As a result, OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. Intel also manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Intel could leverage its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Moreover, computer manufacturers are increasingly using integrated graphics chipsets, particularly for notebooks, because they cost less than traditional discrete graphics components while offering reasonably good graphics performance for most mainstream PCs. Also, Intel has stated that it intends to reenter the discrete GPU market. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels: business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers; control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and, accordingly, spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. 20 Table of Contents Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If our proposed joint venture with ATIC is not consummated, our business could be adversely impacted. On October 6, 2008, we entered into a Master Transaction Agreement with ATIC and WCH pursuant to which we agreed to form a manufacturing joint venture with ATIC, referred to as The Foundry Company. If the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement are not consummated, it could have a number of adverse consequences for our business, including the following: we would not improve our cash balance, on a consolidated basis, by approximately $2.2 billion, of which approximately $800 million will be available for current working capital purposes and $1.4 billion will go to The Foundry Company to fund its operations; we would not be able to transfer approximately $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of our indebtedness to The Foundry Company upon contribution of our ownership interests in the German subsidiaries that own AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG; The Foundry Company would not assume responsibility for funding future wafer manufacturing capital expenditures; we would not be able to take advantage, as a shareholder of The Foundry Company, of the shift by integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, to a fabless business model; our stock price may decline; we would be required to pay WCH a termination fee or reimburse ATIC and WCH for certain expenses pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement; and our business and operations may be harmed to the extent that customers, suppliers and others believe that we cannot effectively compete in the marketplace without the joint venture or there is customer or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our company in the absence of the joint venture. The recent instability of the financial markets may adversely impact our business and operating results. Recently, there has been widespread concern over the instability of the financial markets and their influence on the global economy. As a result of the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy, our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2008, typically, the strongest quarter of our fiscal year, end user demand for PCs and servers decreased significantly. In turn, our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to address end customer demand. We believe this inventory correction will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of 2009, particularly in connection with notebook PCs. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. For example, in January 2009, Qimonda AG, a supplier of memory for our graphics products filed an application with the local court in Munich to commence insolvency proceedings. In addition, the current economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funding through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. If global economic conditions deteriorate further or do not show improvement, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business and operating results. 21 Table of Contents If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. During 2008, we incurred substantial losses that had a negative impact on cash balances. During 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $692 million. As of December 27, 2008, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The recent developments in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and we would be materially adversely affected. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of December 27, 2008, we had consolidated debt of $5.1 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations, if any, to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of the adverse economic and industry conditions that we are currently experiencing. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, or our guarantees of other parties debts, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or 22 Table of Contents equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The current credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges affecting the global economy may further adversely impact our ability to borrow sufficient funds or sell assets or equity. The agreements governing our borrowing arrangements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.75% Notes contains various covenants that limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments if a default or an event of default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from certain asset sales; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate, merge or sell assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety unless specified conditions are met. In addition, our Fab 36 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that prohibit our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 36 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts. Our ability to satisfy these covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants, financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the Fab 36 Term Loan agreement. The agreements governing our borrowing arrangements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes and 7.75% Notes. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 5.75% Notes, 6.00% Notes or 7.75% Notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness. If we are unable to successfully implement our cost cutting efforts, our business could be materially adversely affected. We incurred a net loss of approximately $3.1 billion for 2008. We have taken and plan to continue to undertake a number of actions to decrease our expenses. For example, in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008 we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our expenses. The plans primarily involve the termination of employees. The restructuring plan implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 involves additional cost reduction actions that either have taken place during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 or will take place in 2009. The restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during the second fiscal quarter of 2008 represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits and the costs related to the termination of a contract. The restructuring charges for the restructuring plan implemented during 23 Table of Contents the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 represent primarily severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, contract or program termination costs, asset impairments and exit costs for facility site consolidations and closures. For 2008 these restructuring charges were $90 million. Of the $90 million, approximately $28 million will result in cash expenditures in 2009. In January 2009 we announced additional headcount reductions, primarily focused on manufacturing and sales, marketing, and general and administrative functions, and cost reduction activities including temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain employment benefits such as our 401(k) plan matching program. These additional cost reduction actions will result in an additional charge in the first and second quarters of 2009 and may result in cash expenditures. We also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. If these reductions are not effectively managed, we may experience unanticipated effects from these reductions causing harm to our business and customer relationships. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with required features and performance levels that provide value to our customers and support and coincide with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. If we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Delays in developing or qualifying new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. Moreover, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain overall corporate average selling prices. If we are unable to introduce new products or launch new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting these reductions in average selling prices of existing products, our revenues, inventories, gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. Collectively, our top four customers accounted for approximately 40 percent of our total net revenue in 2008. Moreover, historically a significant portion of ATIs revenues were derived from sales to a small number of customers, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenues of our graphics businesses in the future. During 2008, four customers accounted for approximately 45 percent of the net revenue of our Graphics segment. If one of our top microprocessor or graphics business customers decided to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers were to materially reduce its operations or its demand for our products, we would be materially adversely affected. 24 Table of Contents The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected, and may in the future materially adversely affect, our business. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. The current uncertainty in global economic conditions has also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which has negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. We incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply/demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution, including those of our customers; and excess production capacity. If the current downturn in the semiconductor industry does not improve, we will be materially adversely affected. The demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our microprocessor and graphics businesses are dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop PCs and servers. Industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past, are currently adversely affecting us and may materially adversely affect us in the future. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2008, which is typically our strongest quarter during the fiscal year, end user demand for PCs and servers decreased significantly. In turn, our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to end customer demand, which materially adversely affected us. We believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of 2009, particularly in connection with notebook PCs. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive, and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We expect competition to intensify due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and aggressive pricing by competitors. We believe that the main factors that determine our competitiveness are product quality, power consumption, reliability, speed, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. After a product is introduced, costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves, and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale. We expect that competition will continue to be intense in these markets and our competitors products may be less costly, provide better performance or include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. With respect to our graphics products, Intel and Nvidia are our competitors. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. Competitive pressures could adversely impact the demand for our products, which could harm our revenue and gross margin. 25 Table of Contents If we fail to improve the efficiency of our supply chain in order to respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, acquire new OEM customers and strengthen relationships with existing OEM customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because OEMs tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time frames in which they require delivery of these products. We have previously experienced challenges related to the logistics of delivering our products across a diverse set of customers and geographies on a timely basis. If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our microprocessors. In addition, software drivers sold with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components. We depend on third party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, BIOS software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings. In addition, we continue to work with other third parties to obtain graphics chips in order to provide our customers with a greater choice of technologies to best meet their needs. Our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with Intel does not extend to Intels proprietary bus interface protocol. If we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from designers and manufacturers of motherboards and chipsets, our business would be materially adversely affected. As a result of our acquisition of ATI, we design and supply a significantly greater amount of graphics products ourselves. This may cause third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers to be less willing to do business with us or to support our products out of a perceived risk that we will be less willing to support their products or because we may compete with them. As a result, these third party designers, manufacturers and suppliers could forge relationships, or strengthen their existing relationships, with our competitors. If the designers, manufacturers and suppliers of graphics chips, motherboards, and other components decrease their support for our product offerings and increase their support for the product offerings of our competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in our antitrust lawsuit against Intel, our business may be materially adversely affected. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. Our complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of Intels customers in dealing with us. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted Intels motion to 26 Table of Contents dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007 adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to develop evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing us from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. Trial is set for February 2010. If our antitrust lawsuit against Intel is ultimately unsuccessful, our business, including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market, could be materially adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. A substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenues for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, demand in the retail sector of the PC market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Industry overcapacity and current macro economic conditions could cause us to under utilize our microprocessor manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us. It is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the demand for our products, making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity. Both we and our competitor, Intel, have added significant capacity in recent years, both by expanding capacity at wafer fabrication facilities and by transitioning to more advanced manufacturing technologies. In the past, capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market, which is currently and may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us. During periods of industry overcapacity, customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity, which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements. If the demand from our target markets is below our expectations, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities, which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products for which demand is lower than we anticipate. In addition, due to the current macro economic conditions, in general, and the decrease in orders from our OEM customers which we believe will continue in 2009, in particular, we also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. Many of our costs are fixed. Accordingly, during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products, our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period. When this occurs, our operating results are materially adversely affected. If the demand for our microprocessor products is not consistent with our expectations, we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities. This may have a material adverse effect on us. Manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse effect on us. There may be situations in which our microprocessor manufacturing facilities, including our foundries, are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our microprocessor products. Capacity addition is dependent on many factors such as tool delivery, lead times, installation and qualification. Our inability to provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could result in an adverse effect on our relationships with customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 27 Table of Contents While currently, our owned manufacturing facilities are underutilized, if we do not have or cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our microprocessor products in the long term, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements, we could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third party foundries and other contractors to manufacture our graphics and chipset products. We currently rely on independent foundries such as TSMC and UMC to manufacture our graphics and chipset products. Chartered Semiconductor manufactures some of our microprocessor products. We also rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our high end graphics boards. Independent contractors also perform the assembly, testing and packaging of these products. We obtain manufacturing services for our graphics and chipset products on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product. Accordingly, our graphics business depends on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices. We cannot assure you that these manufacturers will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice. As a result of the recent global market and economic conditions and tighter credit conditions, the third party foundries that we rely on to manufacture our graphics and chipset products may limit investment in increasing capacity, which may increase the risk that these manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements in future periods. We must have reliable relationships with our wafer manufacturers and subcontractors to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. If we move production of our products to new manufacturers or if current manufacturers implement new process technology or design rules, any transition difficulties may result in lower yields or poorer performance of our products. Because it could take several quarters to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative foundries or contractors. Other risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturers include reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and cost, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors, reduced ability to manage inventory and parts, and exposure to foreign countries and operations. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of wafers, our ability to meet customer demand for our graphics business may be adversely affected and this could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we will rely on The Foundry Company to manufacture our microprocessor products and, once The Foundry Company establishes a 32 nanometer qualified process, we will purchase from The Foundry Company, where competitive, specified percentages of our GPU products. If The Foundry Company is unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis or to meet our capacity requirements, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to design and introduce new graphics products in a timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property. In the design and development of new products and graphics product enhancements, we rely on third party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. Our graphics business has experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available third party development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of its products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from graphics 28 Table of Contents products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the third party development tools available to us. If the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. Our microprocessor manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. We purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another. Certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our microprocessor products or that are used in the manufacture of our graphics products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we are largely dependent on one supplier for our silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers that we use to manufacture our microprocessor products. We are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessor products. Similarly, certain non proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources and are often subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. The credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the global economy may impact our key suppliers who may reduce their output and become insolvent which may adversely impact our ability to procure key materials. For example, in January 2009, Qimonda AG, a supplier of memory for our graphics products filed an application with the local court in Munich to commence insolvency proceedings. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials, we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations. Such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us. Unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be materially adversely affected. Manufacturing our microprocessor products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, including their foundries. We continually modify manufacturing processes and transition to more advanced manufacturing process technologies in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, delays in the development or implementation of new process technologies, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs or force us to allocate our reduced product supply among our customers, which could potentially harm our customer relationships, reputation, revenue and gross profit. Our issuance to WCH of 58,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, if and when exercised by ATIC, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and the conversion of our 5.75% Notes and 6.00% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. As part of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we intend to sell to WCH 58,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 35,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. Our issuance of the shares to WCH and any subsequent issuance by us of additional shares to WCH upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of 29 Table of Contents our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market by WCH of any shares we issue to WCH could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and the anticipated exercise by WCH of the warrants we issue to WCH could depress the price of our common stock. Moreover, the conversion of some or all of the 5.75% Notes and the 6.00% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The conversion of the 5.75% Notes and the 6.00% Notes could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 5.75% Notes and 6.00% Notes. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 5.75% Notes or 6.00% Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 5.75% Notes or 6.00% Notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36, Fab 38 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us. We receive capital investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenues, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury, and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect us. In addition, because we sell directly to consumers, we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. 30 Table of Contents Our receipt of royalty revenues is dependent upon the success of third party products. Our graphics technology for game consoles is being used in the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft&reg; Xbox 360 game consoles. The revenues that we receive from these products are in the form of non recurring engineering fees charged for design and development services, as well as per unit royalties paid to us by Nintendo and Microsoft. Our royalty revenues are directly related to the sales of these products and reflective of their success in the market. We have no control over the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Microsoft and we cannot make any assurances that sales of those products will achieve expected levels in the current or future fiscal years. Consequently, the revenues from royalties expected by us from these products may not be fully realized, and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution and transportation management, and co source some information technology services. We rely on third party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished products among our facilities and to our customers. In addition, we rely on a third party in India to provide certain information technology services to us, including helpdesk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access. Our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on us if the transition is not executed appropriately. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty. We base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2008 our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to end customer demand. We believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of 2009, which would increase our uncertainty regarding demand for our products and could materially adversely affect us. With respect to our graphics products, we do not have any commitment or requirements for minimum product purchases in our sales agreement with AIB customers, upon whom we rely to manufacture, market and sell our desktop GPUs. These sales are subject to uncertainty because demand by our AIBs can be unpredictable and susceptible to price competition. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. Moreover, PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on 31 Table of Contents short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on profit margins. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an incremental write down of inventory of $227 million due to a weak economic outlook. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in average selling prices, and or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to estimate customer demand for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors taking aggressive pricing actions. Because market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect us. Our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products. We are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors. However, in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline. Recent failures in the global credit markets may impact the liquidity of our auction rate securities (ARS). As of December 27, 2008, our investments in ARS included approximately $123 million of student loan ARS, $32 million of municipal and corporate ARS and $5 million ARS in preferred shares of closed end mutual funds. Approximately 80 percent of our ARS holdings were AAA rated investments and all of the $123 million student loan ARS were guaranteed by the Federal Family Educational Loan Program. The uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our ARS and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. The auctions failed because there was insufficient demand for these securities. A failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer of the ARS. For each unsuccessful action, the interest rate is reset based on a formula set forth in each security, which is generally higher than the current market unless subject to an interest rate cap. When auctions for these securities fail, the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers of the ARS establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payment is due according to contractual maturities (currently, ranging from 17 to 42 years for our ARS). As a result the liquidity of these investments has been impacted. 32 Table of Contents During 2008, under the guidance of SFAS 157 we determined that the fair value of our ARS was less than their carrying value and as a result, we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of $24 million. At this time, we believe that the current illiquidity of these investments is temporary. Because of the unprecedented events in the ARS market, we cannot predict with certainty when liquidity in the ARS market will return. If this market illiquidity continues or worsens, we may be required to record additional impairment charges with respect to these investments in the future, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations. In October 2008, UBS offered to repurchase all of our ARS that we purchased from UBS prior to February 13, 2008. As of December 27, 2008, we owned $82 million par value of these securities. We accepted this offer. From June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell, at par, these ARS to UBS. Prior to June 30, 2010, we will continue to earn and receive all interest that is payable for these ARS. Furthermore, prior to June 30, 2010, UBS, at its sole discretion, may sell, or otherwise dispose of, and or enter orders in the auctions process with respect to these securities on our behalf so long as we receive par value for the ARS sold. UBS has also agreed to use their best efforts to facilitate issuer redemptions and or to resolve the liquidity concerns of holders of their ARS through restructurings and other means. However, during the course of our exercise period with respect to the UBS ARS, UBS may not have financial resources to satisfy its financial obligations. In the event UBS cannot satisfy its financial obligations, we would no longer have the certainty as to the liquidity of these UBS ARS. We have not realized all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ATI and may continue to incur future impairments of goodwill and assets related to the business acquired from ATI. We have not realized all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of ATI, and since October 2006 we have incurred goodwill impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion, of which approximately $800 million was included in discontinued operations as well as acquisition related impairment charges of approximately $488 million, of which $140 million was included in discontinued operations. These impairment charges were taken following revisions to our long term financial outlook for the businesses of the former ATI in light of then current market conditions and economic outlook, which we conducted as part of our annual strategic planning cycles and based on the preliminary findings of our annual and interim goodwill impairment testing. For 2008, the conclusion was also due to the deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization, which was an additional indicator of impairment. As of December 27, 2008, the carrying amounts of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets were $4 million for our Handheld business unit, $9 million for our Computing Solutions segment and $478 million for our Graphics segment (which now includes revenue from royalties received in connection with sales of game console systems that incorporate our technology). We considered the income approach in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill, which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units discounted using estimated discount rates taking into consideration the estimated sales proceeds that we expect to receive from any divestiture of these businesses. However, actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in further impairment of goodwill. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Currently, all of our wafer manufacturing facilities are concentrated in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. In addition, our graphics and chipset products are manufactured, assembled and tested by independent 33 Table of Contents third parties in the Asia Pacific region and inventory related to those products is stored there, particularly in Taiwan. We also have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy, we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets. Our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated revenue were 88 percent in 2008. The political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in achieving headcount reductions; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health or safety, natural disasters or general economic factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, potentially longer payment cycles, potentially increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us. Worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide economic conditions have adversely affected demand for our products. Also, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the Middle East have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect demand for our products. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, directly or indirectly, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could continue to adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and the Canadian dollar. As a result of our acquisition of ATI, some of our expenses and debt are denominated in 34 Table of Contents Canadian dollars. Additionally, as a result of a new sales program that has been implemented in China, some of our sales in China are now denominated in Chinese Renminbi. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. In the past, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen significantly, leading to increasingly unfavorable currency exchange rates on foreign denominated expenses. However, during the second half of 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened leading to favorable currency exchange rates on foreign denominated expenses. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as payroll and equipment and materials used in manufacturing. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues, because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel, there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products represented as new. Our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and we would be materially adversely affected. 35 Table of Contents We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. We also sell products to consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified, or third parties may bring or have brought actions against us, based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, would have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities. Our operations and properties are subject to various United States and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. 36 Table of Contents Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of lead free products may be less favorable compared to lead based products or that the transition to lead free products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. Other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. All of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in Germany. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our microprocessor products is performed at manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia and Singapore. The independent foundries we use to manufacture our graphics and chipset products are located in the Asia Pacific region and inventory is stored there, particularly in Taiwan. Many of our assembly, testing and packaging suppliers for our graphics products are also located in southern Taiwan. On September 22, 1999, Taiwan suffered a major earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and disrupted the operations of these manufacturing suppliers and contributed to a temporary shortage of graphics processors. Additional earthquakes, fires or other occurrences that disrupt our manufacturing suppliers may occur in the future. To the extent that the supply from our independent foundries or suppliers is interrupted for a prolonged period of time or terminated for any reason, we may not have sufficient time to replace our supply of products manufactured by those foundries. Moreover, our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. In the event of a major earthquake, or other natural or manmade disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada, Germany and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material effect on our cash, goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of ATI, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. For example, the Canadian Revenue Agency, or CRA, is auditing ATI for the years 2000 2004 with respect to transactions between ATI and its subsidiaries. The audit has been completed and we have responded to the CRAs letter of proposed adjustments in July 2008. We could be subject to significant tax liability as well as a loss of certain tax credits and other tax attributes as a result of the CRA audit. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have not received any written comments that were issued more than 180 days before December 27, 2008, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that remain unresolved. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES At December 27, 2008, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 4.5 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices. Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 265,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. In some cases, we lease all or a portion of the land on which our facilities are located. We lease approximately 218,000 square feet of land in Singapore and 270,000 square feet of land in Suzhou, China for our microprocessor and test facilities. As of December 27, 2008, we also leased approximately 3.1 million square feet of space for engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative use, including a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2018. We also have approximately 285,000 square feet of building space that is currently vacant. We continue to have lease obligations with respect to this space that expire at various dates through 2011. We are actively marketing this space for sublease. Spansion Inc. leases approximately 71,000 square feet from us. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy, or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that, except as discussed above, the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In addition to ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, AMD or its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, ATI, is party to the following material legal proceedings. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and, should any of the actions or proceedings where we are a defendant be successful, we may be subject to significant damages awards which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. AMD and AMDISS v. Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, Civil Action No. 05 441, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On June 27, 2005, we filed an antitrust complaint against Intel Corporation and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, collectively Intel, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, and the California Business and Professions Code. The complaint alleges that Intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that in effect limit Intels customers ability and or incentive to deal with us. The complaint alleges anti competitive business practices, including: Forcing major customers into Intel exclusive deals in return for outright cash payments, discriminatory pricing or marketing subsidies conditioned on the exclusion of AMD; Forcing other major customers into partial exclusivity agreements by conditioning rebates, allowances and market development funds on customers agreement to severely limit or forego entirely purchases from AMD; 38 Table of Contents Establishing a system of discriminatory and retroactive incentives triggered by purchases at such high levels as to have the intended effect of denying customers the freedom to purchase any significant volume of processors from AMD; Establishing and enforcing quotas among key retailers, effectively requiring them to stock overwhelmingly or exclusively computers with Intel microprocessors, and thereby artificially limiting consumer choice; and Forcing PC makers and technology partners to boycott AMD product launches or promotions. We requested the following findings and remedies: A finding that Intel is abusing its market power by forcing on the industry technical standards and products that have as their main purpose handicapping us in the marketplace; A finding that Intel is wrongfully maintaining its monopoly in the x86 microprocessor market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and treble damages to us in an amount to be proven at trial, pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15(a); A finding that Intel has made secret payments and allowance of rebates and discounts, and that Intel secretly and discriminatorily extended to certain purchasers special services or privileges, all in violation of California Business & Professions Code 17045 and treble damages for our resulting lost profits in an amount to be proven at trial; A finding that Intel has intentionally interfered with our valuable business relationships to our economic detriment and damages to us in an amount to be proven at trial for its resulting losses, as well as punitive damages, as permitted by law; Injunctive relief prohibiting Intel from engaging in any further conduct unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act or Section 17045 of the California Business and Professions Code; An award to us of such other, further and different relief as may be necessary or appropriate to restore and maintain competitive conditions in the x86 microprocessor market; and An award of attorneys fees and costs. Intel filed its answer on September 1, 2005. On September 26, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted the motion of Intel Corporation to dismiss foreign conduct claims. The effect of that decision was clarified by the Courts January 12, 2007 adoption of the Special Masters decision on our motion to compel foreign conduct discovery. As a result of these two decisions, we will be permitted to introduce evidence of Intels exclusionary practices wherever they occur, including practices foreclosing AMD from foreign customers or in foreign market segments. However, the courts ruling limits our damages to lost sales in the United States and lost sales abroad that would have originated from the United States. At a hearing on June 5, 2008, the court rescheduled the trial date from April 27, 2009 to February 15, 2010. The discovery process is ongoing. Other Related Proceedings On June 30, 2005, our Japanese subsidiary, AMD Japan K.K., or AMD Japan, filed an action in Japan against Intel Corporations Japanese subsidiary, Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, or Intel K.K., in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court for damages arising from violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. Through its suit in the Tokyo High Court, AMD Japan seeks damages, following on the Japan Fair Trade Commissions (JFTC) findings in its March 8, 2005 Recommendation, or the JFTC Recommendation, that Intel K.K. committed violations of Japans Antimonopoly Act. The JFTC Recommendation concluded that Intel K.K. interfered with AMD Japans business activities by providing large amounts of funds to five Japanese PC manufacturers (NEC, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi) on the condition that they refuse to purchase AMDs 39 Table of Contents microprocessors. The suit alleges that as a result of these illegal acts, AMD Japan suffered serious damages, losing all of its sales of microprocessors to Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi, while sales of microprocessors to NEC and Fujitsu also fell precipitously. Through its suit in the Tokyo District Court, AMD Japan seeks damages for various anticompetitive acts in addition to those covered in the scope of the JFTC Recommendation. The suit alleges that these anticompetitive acts also had the effect of interfering with AMD Japans right to engage in normal business and marketing activities. U.S. Consumer Class Action Lawsuits In February and March 2006, two consumer class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against ATI and three of its subsidiaries. The complaints allege that ATI had misrepresented its graphics cards as being HDCP ready when they were not, and on that basis alleged violations of state consumer protection statutes, breach of express and implied warranty, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. On April 18, 2006, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On June 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, alleging violations of Californias consumer protection laws, breach of express warranty, and unjust enrichment. On June 21, 2006, a third consumer class action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in May 2006 alleging claims that are substantially the same was transferred to the Northern District of California, and on July 31, 2006, that case was also consolidated into the consolidated action pending in the Northern District of California. ATI filed an answer to the consolidated complaint on August 7, 2006. On January 30, 2009, ATI, on behalf of itself, AMD, and, ATI Technologies Systems Corp., ATI Research Silicon Valley Inc., and ATI Research, Inc. (all former indirect subsidiaries of AMD) (collectively ATI), executed a settlement agreement relating to the claims of a proposed settlement class of all persons who, while residing in the United States, purchased, for their own personal use and not for resale, certain graphics cards specified in the settlement agreement, during the period from January 1, 2003 to March 31, 2006. Plaintiffs claim that the cards specified in the settlement agreement were marketed as HDCP ready, HDCP compliant, or HDCP capable, or otherwise conforming to HDCP specifications for the transmission of HDCP content. In exchange for a dismissal of all claims related to the lawsuit, the settlement agreement calls for ATI to pay $4,000,000 in cash, and to make available for distribution to class members, as specified in the settlement agreement, new graphics cards with a value up to approximately $7,500,000, or, if class members submit more than 71,500 authorized claims, then ATI will pay $3,000,000 in cash instead of providing any new graphics cards for distribution to class members. ATI is not obligated under the settlement agreement to pay attorneys fees, costs, or make any other payments in connection with the settlement. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and, if approved, would dispose of all claims raised by the putative class in the lawsuit against ATI. GPU Class Actions More than fifty related antitrust actions were filed against AMD, ATI and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), all of which were consolidated and transferred to the Northern District of California in the action In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation. According to the complaints, plaintiffs filed each of the actions after reading press reports that AMD and NVIDIA had received subpoenas from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with its investigation announced in November 2006 into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processing units and cards. On October 10, 2008, the DOJ informed AMD that it had closed its investigation into ATIs pricing and marketing practices in the sales of GPUs. No action was taken by the DOJ in connection with the investigation. All of the actions appeared to allege that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain, or stabilize the prices of graphics processing units and cards in violation of federal antitrust law and or state antitrust law. Each complaint was styled as a putative class action and alleged a class of plaintiffs (either indirect or direct purchasers) who purportedly suffered injury as a result of the defendants alleged conduct. Class plaintiffs (direct and indirect) filed amended consolidated complaints in June 2007. On July 18, 2008, the court denied the indirect purchasers motion for class certification in its entirety and granted class certification 40 Table of Contents only to a limited class of individuals and entities who purchased graphics processing card products online from defendants websites in the United States during the period from December 4, 2002 to November 7, 2007. On September 16, 2008, we and certain indirect subsidiaries and NVIDIA executed a settlement agreement relating to the claims of the certified class of direct purchaser plaintiffs previously approved by the District Court for the Northern District of California. The settlement agreement requires us to make a payment of $850,000 into a fund for the benefit of the certified class in exchange for a dismissal of all claims related to the lawsuit. We are not obligated under the settlement agreement to pay attorneys fees, costs, or make any other payments in connection with the settlement. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and, if approved, would dispose of all claims raised by the certified class. On October 2, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order staying the direct purchaser plaintiffs petition for permission to appeal the District Courts order regarding class certification. On December 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the direct purchaser settlement. The final approval hearing is scheduled for March 26, 2009. On September 9, 2008, we and certain indirect subsidiaries and NVIDIA also reached a settlement agreement with the remaining individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the lawsuit under which we paid $112,500 in exchange for a dismissal of all claims and appeals related to the lawsuit raised by the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs. This settlement was not subject to the approval of the District Court. Pursuant to the settlement, the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs dismissed their claims and withdrew their petition for permission to appeal the District Courts order denying their motion for class certification. AMD v. Samsung Electronics Co. et al On February 19, 2008, AMD and ATI filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung) and related Samsung entities alleging infringement of six AMD patents. The complaint was amended in May 2008 to add a seventh patent and also to add two additional Samsung entities as defendants to the suit. The case is filed in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California. The AMD patents generally relate to semiconductors, semiconductor memory, and related products. We are seeking damages and injunctive relief. The majority of the Samsung entities answered on May 15, 2008; two Samsung entities answered on July 16, 2008. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. filed an answer and counterclaims on May 15, 2008, alleging infringement by AMD and or ATI of six Samsung patents. The Samsung patents generally relate to semiconductor fabrication and design. Samsung is seeking damages and injunctive relief. We filed our answer to Samsungs counterclaims on August 1, 2008. The court has scheduled a trial date of September 13, 2010. Department of Justice Subpoena On October 10, 2008, U.S. Department of Justice informed us it had closed its investigation into ATIs pricing and marketing practices in the sale of GPUs. Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. 41 Table of Contents To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3.3 million in accordance with applicable accounting rules and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty, and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various other actions that arose in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4.

As a result, 2008 and 2007 are not fully comparable to prior periods. In 2008 we decided to divest the Digital Television business unit and classified it as discontinued operations. See footnote 9 below. 45 Table of Contents (2) 2006 includes the operations of ATI for the period from October 25, 2006 through December 31 2006. As a result 2006 is not fully comparable to 2008, 2007 or prior periods. (3) 2004 includes the results of operations for our former Memory Products segment for the entire year. Therefore, 2004 is not fully comparable to 2005 during which Spansions results of operations were not consolidated with our results of operations for the last five days of the fiscal year. From December 21, 2005, the date that Spansion closed its IPO, through December 25, 2005 and for all of 2006 we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of Spansions net income (loss). We include this information under the caption, Equity in net income (loss) of Spansion Inc. and other, on our consolidated statement of operations. In September 2007, as a result of our loss of the ability to exercise significant influence over Spansion, we ceased applying the equity method of accounting and began accounting for this investment as available for sale marketable securities. Therefore, 2007 and 2008 are not fully comparable to prior periods. (4) The increase in interest expense from $126 million in 2006 to $367 million in 2007 was composed of interest on new debt instruments outstanding including our 6.00% Notes, 5.75% Notes, Fab 36 Term Loan and October 2006 Term Loan. (5) For 2004, other income (expense), net, includes a charge of approximately $32 million associated with our exchange of $201 million of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 for common stock and a charge of approximately $14 million in connection with our prepayment of amounts outstanding under a term loan agreement among our German subsidiary, AMD Fab 30 Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, and the lenders party thereto. (6) The 2006, 2007 and 2008 minority interest amounts represent the guaranteed rate of return of between 11 and 13 percent related to the limited partnership contributions that AMD Fab 36 KG received from the unaffiliated partners (Fab 36 Minority Interest); and the 2005 and 2004 minority interest amount includes the Fab 36 Minority Interest and Spansion Related Minority Interest. However, in April 2008, we repurchased the partnership interests in AMD Fab 36 KG held by one of the unaffiliated partners, Fab 36 Beteiligungs. (7) In 2005 we recorded a loss of $110 million due to the dilution in our ownership interest in Spansion from 60 percent to approximately 38 percent in connection with Spansions IPO. This represented the difference between Spansions book value per share before and after the IPO multiplied by the number of shares owned by us. In September 2007, as a result of our loss of the ability to exercise significant influence over Spansion, we ceased applying the equity method of accounting and began accounting for this investment as available for sale marketable securities. In 2007 we recorded impairment charges of $111 million. In 2008 we recorded impairment charges of $53 million. See Part II, Item 7 MD&A Equity in net loss of Spansion Inc and other. (8) The 2006 and 2007 income tax provisions resulted from current foreign taxes. In 2006, foreign benefits resulted from the reduction of valuation allowance on German net operating loss carryovers related to Fab 36. In 2007, benefits resulted from previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays. In 2006 the provision was increased by deferred U.S. tax related to indefinite lived goodwill. In 2007, the provision was reduced by a similar amount (for indefinite lived goodwill) as a result of goodwill impairment. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily results from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. (9) During the second quarter of 2008 we decided to divest the Digital Television business and classified it as discontinued operations and, during the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an agreement with Broadcom to sell certain assets related to the Digital Television business unit. The sale transaction was completed on October 27, 2008 for $141.5 million. See Part II, Item 7 MD&A Discontinued Operations. (10) Total assets decreased $3,875 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the impairment of ATI acquisition related goodwill and acquired intangible assets, lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities due to our significant losses, and the sale and impairment of assets associated with the divestiture of the Digital Television business unit in 2008. Total assets decreased $1,597 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the impairment of ATI acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets. Total assets increased $5,859 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of the acquisition of ATI. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
