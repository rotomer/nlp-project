ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies" on page 37. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, we acquired various communications sites, service businesses and satellite and fiber network access related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $827.2 million, $1.8 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. Our results of operations only reflect the acquired towers and businesses in the periods following their respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 1999. 23 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 As of December 31, 2001, we owned or operated approximately 14,500 communications sites, as compared to approximately 11,000 communications sites as of December 31, 2000. The acquisitions and construction completed in 2001 and 2000 have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000.

The increase is primarily attributable to several factors: the leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed during 2001, the leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed in 2000 for a full year in 2001, and an increase in same tower revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2000. Our acquisition, construction and leasing activity in 2001 has significantly increased revenue, and the scope, depth and strength of our national and international tower footprint, providing us with a much larger base of tower revenue in 2001 as compared to 2000. Specifically, during 2001, we acquired more than 2,400 towers and constructed more than 1,300 towers. Additionally, during 2001, we added more than 4,600 broadband equivalent tenants to both newly acquired/constructed and existing towers. We anticipate that the majority of our leasing activity during 2002 will continue to come from broadband type customers. 24 We continue to believe that leasing revenues from the rental of space on our towers, which comprises our core business, are likely to grow at a more rapid rate than revenues from our other segments because of increasing utilization of existing tower capacity. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $454.2 million, an increase of $142.3 million from revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000. The significant growth in revenues during 2001 resulted primarily from increased volume related to construction management, antennae and line installation and related colocation services, and tower site maintenance. The increase was also driven by a full year of revenue in 2001 related to acquisitions consummated in 2000. These acquisitions helped increase revenue in 2001 related to component part sales and steel fabrication. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue related to radio frequency engineering services. Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services Revenue Satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $235.4 million, an increase of $90.2 million from revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from the consummation of several key acquisitions that occurred in 2001 and 2000 including: General Telecom, U.S. Electrodynamics, Publicom, Interpacket Networks and a SNAP facility in Switzerland. These acquisitions significantly increased our service capabilities, revenue base, and geographical scope of customers, leading to significant incremental revenues in 2001. This increase in revenue was partially offset by the loss of many of its second and third tier telecom customers and a decrease in demand for services in Latin America, which we believe are attributable, at least in part, to the general worldwide economic slowdown and the significant decrease in the activity of international ISPs. Rental and Management Expense Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $214.5 million, an increase of $75.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2001 for the more than 3,700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 as discussed above. The remaining increase reflects higher operating expenses related to towers that existed as of December 31, 2000 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2001). Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $405.6 million, an increase of $130.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase is due to overall increases in the volume of services work performed, incremental expenses related to the consummation of strategic acquisitions and increases in the overhead costs necessary to support both internal construction and external sales. Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services Expense Satellite and fiber network access services expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $228.0 million, an increase of $117.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase is due to incremental expenses related to the consummation of the strategic acquisitions discussed above. Other components of the increase include increased personnel and infrastructure costs to help manage the growth of this segment, increased overhead related to the development and marketing of new product lines and, to a lesser extent, increased bad debt expense. During the later stages of 2001 and into 2002, our satellite and fiber network access services segment is focusing on implementing cost reduction measures aimed at reducing infrastructure costs, consolidating 25 transponder space and renegotiating certain transponder agreements. These inititives are designed to improve operating margins and position Verestar for structural independence. Such initiatives could result in us recording a restructuring charge in 2002 of between $5.0 million and $15.0 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $440.4 million, an increase of $157.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The principal component of the increase is an increase in depreciation expense of $104.0 million. This is primarily a result of our purchase, construction and acquisition of approximately $1.4 billion of property and equipment during 2001 and a full year of depreciation on aquisitions and additions made in 2000. The other component of the increase is increased amortization of $53.0 million, resulting from our recording and amortizing approximately $184.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions consummated during 2001, and a full year of amortization on goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 2000. Restructuring Expense On November 6, 2001, we announced a restructuring of the organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development activities and the centralization of certain operating functions. As part of that operational initiative, we are applying more selective criteria for evaluating construction and acquisitions of towers. As a result, we abandoned a number of tower construction sites, resulting in a non cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 of approximately $62.6 million. In addition, we implemented an initiative to consolidate operations in each of our business segments and, as a consequence, incurred employee separation and office closing costs. As a result of this initiative, we recorded approximately $6.6 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2001 and expect we will record approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2002. No similar charges were incurred in 2000. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $8.6 million, a decrease of $5.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site inspections, data gathering and acquisition integration in 2001. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $26.5 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase is a result of increased personnel and information technology costs to support our overall growth, coupled with expenses incurred to implement a new company wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $282.3 million, an increase of $125.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase, $113.0 million, resulted primarily from increased borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and the issue of $1.0 billion of senior notes in January 2001, offset by a decrease in interest rates under our credit facilities. The remaining component of the increase represents increases in interest on capital leases and other notes payable and incremental deferred financing amortization. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $26.7 million, an increase of $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on invested cash on hand, resulting principally from the sale of our senior notes in January 2001, partially offset by losses on the fair value of certain derivative instruments. 26 Interest Income TV Azteca, Net Interest income TV Azteca, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $14.4 million, an increase of $1.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted from interest earned on the entire principal amount of the note, $119.8 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000 when less than the entire principal amount of the note was outstanding for the year. Loss on Investments Loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $40.6 million, an increase of $38.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from the write off of our investment in US Wireless of $23.4 million, coupled with additional investment impairment losses of $8.2 million and losses on equity investments of $9.0 million. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a non cash charge of $26.3 million. In similar transactions during the year ended December 31, 2000, we acquired a portion of our 6.25% and 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, we recorded a non cash charge of $17.0 million during that year. These charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to encourage them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Benefit for Income Taxes The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $116.8 million, an increase of $57.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The primary reason for the increase is a result of an increase in our loss before income taxes and extraordinary losses, partially offset by an increase in amortization of non deductible intangible assets arising from stock acquisitions, non deductible note conversion expense, and the valuation allowance primarily related to our state net operating loss carryforwards. The effective tax rate differs in both periods from the statutory rate due to state and international taxes, the valuation allowance and the effect of non deductible items, principally the amortization of goodwill on certain stock acquisitions and non deductible note conversion expense. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is "more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized." At December 31, 2001, we provided a valuation allowance primarily related to our state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $56.3 million. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. Extraordinary Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net We incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt, net in 2000 of $4.3 million. The losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and restatement of our primary credit facilities ($3.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $2.0 million) and our early retirement of debt assumed in the UNISite, Inc. merger ($1.3 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.9 million). No comparable losses were recorded in 2001. 27 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999 As of December 31, 2000, we owned or operated approximately 11,000 communications sites, as compared to approximately 5,100 communications sites as of December 31, 1999. The acquisitions and construction completed in 2000 and 1999 have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Year Ended December 31, Amount of Percent Increase Increase 2000 1999 (Decrease) (Decrease) (in thousands) Revenues: Rental and management........................................... $ 278,153 $135,303 $142,850 106% Network development services.................................... 311,921 90,416 221,505 245 Satellite and fiber network access services..................... 145,201 32,362 112,839 349 Total operating revenues................................. 735,275 258,081 477,194 185 Operating Expenses: Rental and management........................................... 139,240 62,441 76,799 123 Network development services.................................... 274,769 69,318 205,451 296 Satellite and fiber network access services..................... 110,065 24,098 85,967 357 Total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, development and corporate general and administrative expenses............................ 524,074 155,857 368,217 236 Depreciation and amortization................................... 283,360 132,539 150,821 114 Development expense............................................. 14,517 1,607 12,910 803 Corporate general and administrative expense.................... 14,958 9,136 5,822 64 Interest expense................................................ 156,839 27,492 129,347 470 Interest income and other, net.................................. 15,556 17,442 (1,886) (11) Interest income TV Azteca, net of interest expense of $1,047 in 2000.......................................................... 12,679 1,856 10,823 583 (Loss) gain on investments......................................

The increase is primarily attributable to two factors: the acquisition and construction of towers in 2000 and the latter part of 1999 and increased lease ups (utilization) of new and existing towers. During 2000, we continued to implement our growth strategy by aggressively acquiring and building new towers. With the consummation of the AirTouch, AT&T and other transactions, we acquired more than 4,600 towers in 2000. This coupled with the construction of over 1,600 towers in 2000, increased the scope, depth and strength of our national and international tower footprint providing us with a much larger base of towers generating revenue in 2000 as compared to 1999. During 2000, we also focused on implementing an area management structure that enhances sales and marketing, enabling us to increase the utilization of both previously existing (prior to January 2000) and newly acquired/constructed towers. Increased utilization resulted in increases in revenue in 2000 for towers that were in our portfolio as of January 1, 2000. 28 Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $311.9 million, an increase of $221.5 million from revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999. The significant growth in revenues during 2000 resulted from strategic acquisitions and increased demand for installation work and component parts from major wireless carriers. During 2000, we acquired several key services companies that added additional revenue and expanded our in house services capabilities. Among the acquisitions were Galaxy Engineering Services, which enables us to perform an array of radio frequency engineering and network design services, such as drive testing, voice quality analysis and transport engineering, and Kline Iron & Steel Co., a steel fabrication company with expertise in broadcast towers. In addition, increased demand for some of our network development services, such as equipment installation, maintenance and sales of component parts, also created additional revenue in 2000. Much of this increased demand was a result of aggressive network expansion programs initiated by major wireless communications carriers during the year. In contrast, our revenues from site acquisition and construction work for others, which are also part of our network development services segment, have declined. This decline is attributable to the trend in the wireless communications industry to outsource tower infrastructure needs. This trend means we are increasingly applying our site acquisition and construction capabilities to our build to suit projects and for other construction for our own account. Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services Revenue Satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $145.2 million, an increase of $112.8 million from revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999. The majority of the increase can be attributed to the consummation of several key acquisitions that occurred in 2000 and the fourth quarter of 1999 including: ICG Satellite Services, General Telecom, U.S. Electrodynamics, and Publicom. These acquisitions significantly increased our service capabilities, revenue base, and geographical scope of our customers as well as providing significant incremental revenues in 2000. We also experienced an increase in demand of the Internet and data requirements of our Internet service provider customers in 2000. Rental and Management Expense Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $139.2 million, an increase of $76.8 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. A significant portion of the increase is attributable to incremental operating expenses incurred in 2000 for towers that were acquired or constructed during 2000 and the latter part of 1999 as discussed above. The remaining component of the increase is primarily related to additional expenses incurred by us in 2000 to implement our area management structure together with, to a lesser extent, increases in operating expenses on towers that existed prior to January 1, 2000. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $274.8 million, an increase of $205.5 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The significant increase in expense is primarily due to the strategic acquisitions consummated in 2000 as discussed above. In addition, we incurred expenses in 2000 to transition a portion of our construction services unit from tower construction work to equipment installation and other services. This transition was related, in part, to an ongoing process to decentralize some of our tower construction capabilities and develop some of those capabilities at our regional and area locations. Remaining increases in expense are directly related to a charge for a bad debt reserve of approximately $7.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter and overall increases in the amount of services and component sales to customers. 29 Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services Expense Satellite and fiber network access services expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $110.1 million, an increase of $86.0 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. Substantially all of the increase can be attributed to the strategic acquisitions discussed above, together with additional expenses related to integrating those acquisitions. Remaining increases are related to the building of infrastructure to help manage the growth of this segment and overall increases in volume. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $283.4 million, an increase of $150.8 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. One component of the increase is attributable to an increase in depreciation expense of $74.8 million. This is a direct result of our purchase, construction and acquisition of approximately $1.3 billion of property and equipment during 2000 and a full year of depreciation on acquisitions and additions made in 1999. The remaining component of the increase is an increase in amortization of $76.0 million, resulting from our recording and amortizing approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions consummated during 2000, and a full year of amortizaton on goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 1999. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $14.5 million, an increase of $12.9 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The majority of the increase represents costs related to tower site inspections, related data gathering and certain integration expenses related to acquisitions consummated in 2000. The remaining component of the increase represents expenses incurred in connection with abandoned acquisitions and other acquisition related costs which are not capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $15.0 million, an increase of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The majority of the increase is a result of higher personnel, marketing, professional services and information technology costs associated with supporting our increasing number of towers, the growth of our other businesses, our expanding revenue base and our growth strategy. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $156.8 million, an increase of $129.3 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily related to increased borrowings to finance acquisitions and construction. The net change, specifically, is attributable to increases in interest incurred on our outstanding debt obligations of $131.7 million and deferred financing amortization of $5.6 million. These interest increases were offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to construction projects of $8.0 million. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $15.6 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest earned on invested cash on hand as a consequence of such cash being used to finance acquisitions and construction. 30 Interest Income TV Azteca, Net Interest income TV Azteca, net for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $12.7 million, an increase of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Amounts included within this caption at December 31, 2000 represent interest earned on our note receivable from TV Azteca of $13.7 million offset by interest expense of $1.0 million. (Loss) Gain on Investments Loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.5 million, an increase of $2.8 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase resulted primarily from losses on equity investments made in 2000. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2000, we acquired a portion of our 6.25% and 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded an expense of approximately $17.0 million during the second quarter of 2000, which represents the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to encourage them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $59.7 million, an increase of $59.9 million from the year ended December 31, 1999. The primary reason for the increase is a result of an increase in our loss before income taxes and extraordinary losses, partially offset by an increase in amortization of non deductible intangible assets arising from stock acquisitions, non deductible note conversion expense and the valuation allowance primarily related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The effective tax rate differs in both periods from the statutory rate due to the effect of non deductible items, principally the amortization of goodwill on certain stock acquisitions and, for the year ended December 31, 2000, the non deductible note conversion expense on which we have recorded no tax benefit. FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is "more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized". At December 31, 2001, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $6.0 million. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the twenty year carryforward period. Extraordinary Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net We incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2000 of $4.3 million. The losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and restatement of our primary credit facilities ($3.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $2.0 million) and our early retirement of debt assumed in the UNISite, Inc. merger ($1.3 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.9 million). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW We plan to fund our current business plan with cash generated from our operations and by borrowing under our credit facilities. Historically, we have met our operational liquidity needs and interest expense related to our debt obligations primarily with internally generated funds. We have financed our tower acquisitions and construction activities with a combination of capital funds from sales of our equity and debt securities and bank borrowings. 31 In the latter half of 2001, major wireless carriers reduced their planned capital expenditures for geographic network expansion. We expect that wireless carriers will make capital expenditures in 2002 primarily to increase the density of their current network coverage and improve the quality of service to existing subscribers while selectively investing to expand network coverage. During the later part of the year we began to reduce our tower construction program, and in November 2001 we announced new operational initiatives to reduce significantly our tower development activities and to consolidate operations in each of our business segments. We expect that during 2003 we will become free cash flow positive, meaning that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our operational needs, interest expense and capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources from our operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit facilities to support our business plan until that occurs. USES OF LIQUIDITY Our uses of liquidity include: operational needs; capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions; and debt service. Tower Construction and Acquisition Needs. We have significantly reduced our planned level of tower construction and acquisitions for 2002. As a result, we anticipate that our liquidity needs for new tower development and acquisitions in 2002 will be significantly less than in previous years. . Tower Construction. Our 2002 capital budget provides for total capital expenditures of approximately $200.0 million to $225.0 million, which includes towers to be built under existing build to suit agreements. In contrast, we spent $568.0 million on total capital expenditures in 2001. We plan to build in 2002 between 400 and 500 towers, including nine broadcast towers. In contrast, we built approximately 1,300 towers, including five broadcast towers, in 2001. . Tower Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2001, we were committed to make capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 million for pending acquisitions, including $8.4 million for ALLTEL, which we closed in January and February 2002. We spent approximately $809.6 million in cash in 2001 for acquisitions. Debt Service. We use a significant portion of our liquidity to service our outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding total long term debt of about $3.6 billion, consisting primarily of the following: . our credit facilities $1.45 billion; . our senior notes $1.0 billion; and . our convertible notes, net of discount $866.9 million Our credit facilities, senior notes and convertible notes require us to make significant principal payments at their respective maturity dates. In addition, in the case of our credit facilities, we must make scheduled amortization payments of principal prior to maturity. Beginning March 31, 2003, our credit facilities require amortization of the term loans in increasing annual amounts designed to repay the loans by maturity. Interest on our senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. Under our credit facilities, we are required to maintain an interest reserve for our senior notes through the August 2002 interest payment. These funds can only be used to make scheduled interest payments on those notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $94.1 million of restricted cash related to that interest reserve. Interest on our convertible notes is payable semi annually. Prior to maturity, there are no mandatory redemption provisions for cash in the senior notes or the convertible notes. The holders of the convertible notes, however, have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to maturity, but we may pay the repurchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock. For a more complete description of our outstanding indebtedness, see "Contractual Commitments" below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 32 SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY Our primary sources of liquidity historically have been internally generated funds from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity and debt offerings and cash on hand. Internally Generated Funds. Our operating revenues, divisional cash flow and EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $1.1 billion, $300.5 million and $274.0 million, respectively. Our tower leasing activities generate the highest profit margins. We believe those activities are likely to grow more rapidly than our other segments because of increased utilization of our existing towers. Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2001, we had not drawn on the $650.0 million revolving line of credit under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2001, based on financial covenants and giving effect to the repayment of our Mexican credit facility described below, we had the ability to draw $555.0 million on this revolving line of credit. Because of existing cash on hand, our anticipated borrowing needs and the unused capacity in our credit facilities, in January 2002, we chose to cancel our incremental $250.0 million Term C Loan. As a result, our maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facilities was reduced from $2.25 billion to $2.0 billion. Proceeds from Equity and Debt Offerings. Historically, we have been successful at raising funds in the capital markets through equity and debt offerings. We have used these proceeds mostly to fund new tower development and acquisitions. For example, in January 2001, we completed a public offering of 10.0 million shares of our Class A common stock for total net proceeds of approximately $360.8 million. We also completed in that month a private placement of $1.0 billion of our senior notes for total net proceeds of $969.0 million. Cash On Hand. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $130.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Approximately $94.1 million is restricted under our credit facilities and can only be used to make scheduled interest payments on the senior notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $179.5 million of working capital. PLANS TO FUND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS We plan to fund our operational liquidity needs through internally generated funds from operations. We plan to fund our capital expenditures for new tower construction and acquisitions and our interest expense through a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities. We anticipate aggregate incremental borrowing needs for 2002 and 2003 of under $200.0 million. During 2003, we expect that our operating cash flows will become sufficient to fund both our capital expenditures for new tower construction and acquisitions and the interest expense on our outstanding debt. We may, in the future, need to raise cash from external sources to meet our debt service obligations and to pay the principal amounts of our indebtedness when due. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS Below is a summary of our credit facilities, senior notes, convertible notes and certain other contractual obligations. It is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements which are summarized. Also see note 6 and note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for more information about the terms of our indebtedness and our commitments and contingencies. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities provide us with a borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion, with the option, subject to lender approval, to increase the capacity up to an additional $500.0 million. Our principal operating subsidiaries are the borrowers under our credit facilities. Borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with certain financial ratios as described below. Our credit facilities currently include: 33 . a $650.0 million revolving credit facility which was fully available, subject to compliance with those financial ratios, on December 31, 2001, maturing on June 30, 2007; . an $850.0 million multi draw Term Loan A, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2001, maturing on June 30, 2007; and . a $500.0 million Term Loan B, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2001, maturing on December 31, 2007. The credit facilities are scheduled to amortize quarterly commencing in March 2003. In January 2002, we terminated a $250.0 million multi draw Term Loan C facility, none of which facility had been drawn. As a result of this termination, we will record a non cash charge of $7.5 million to "other expense" in the first quarter of 2002 related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees. We believe the $650.0 million revolving credit facility remaining under the $2.0 billion of credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our business plan. Our credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions with which the borrower subsidiaries and the restricted subsidiaries must comply. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow more funds, but would also constitute a default. For more information about these covenants, see "Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Credit Facilities". They also restrict our ability, as the parent company of the borrower subsidiaries, to incur any debt other than that presently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. We and our restricted subsidiaries have guaranteed all of the loans. We have secured the loans by liens on substantially all assets of the borrower subsidiaries and the restricted subsidiaries and substantially all outstanding capital stock and other debt and equity interests of all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Under our credit facilities, we are also required to maintain an interest reserve for our senior notes through the August 2002 interest payment. These funds can only be used to make scheduled interest payments on those notes. As of December 31, 2001 we had approximately $94.1 million of restricted cash related to that interest reserve. In February 2001, our Mexican subsidiary and two of its subsidiaries consummated a loan agreement with a group of banks providing a credit facility of an initial aggregate amount of $95.0 million. As of December 31, 2001, an aggregate of $95.0 million was outstanding under this loan agreement. In February 2002 we repaid all of the loans with borrowings under our credit facilities, and our Mexican subsidiaries became restricted subsidiaries under our credit facilities. As a result of such repayment, we will recognize an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2002 of approximately $1.3 million (net of an income tax benefit of $0.7 million). 9 3/8% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of 9 3/8 % senior notes. The senior notes mature on February 1, 2009. Interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. The indenture governing the senior notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur more debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make certain investments. For more information about these covenants, see "Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Senior Notes". October 1999 Convertible Notes. In October 1999, we issued 6.25% convertible notes due 2009 in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million and 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 at an issue price of $300.1 million, representing 70.52% of their principal amount at maturity of $425.5 million. The difference between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity of the 2.25% convertible notes will be accreted each year as interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. The 6.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.40 per share. The 2.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.00 per share. The indentures under which the convertible notes are outstanding do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of debt or liens or the repurchase of our equity securities or any financial covenants. 34 We may not redeem the 6.25% convertible notes prior to October 22, 2002. Thereafter, we can redeem the 6.25% convertible notes, at our option, in whole or in part at a redemption price initially of 103.125% of the principal amount. The redemption price declines ratably immediately after October 15 of each following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2005. We may not redeem the 2.25% convertible notes prior to October 22, 2003. Thereafter, we can redeem the 2.25% convertible notes, at our option, in whole or in part at increasing redemption prices designed to reflect the original issue discount. We are also required to pay accrued and unpaid interest in all redemptions of notes. Holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 6.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2006 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003 at $802.93, which is its issue price plus accreted original issue discount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We may, at our option, elect to pay the repurchase price of each series in cash or shares of Class A common stock, or any combination thereof. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase the convertible notes for cash. In the third quarter of 2001, we acquired a portion of our outstanding convertible notes. During this period, approximately $82.5 million in face amount ($61.6 million carrying amount) of our 2.25% convertible notes was converted into shares of Class A common stock. All of these conversions were pursuant to exchange agreements that we negotiated with a limited number of noteholders. Pursuant to these exchange agreements, we issued an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million shares of Class A common stock that these noteholders were entitled to receive based on the conversion price set forth in the applicable indenture, plus an additional approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. As a result of these transactions, in the third quarter of 2001 we recorded a non cash charge of $26.3 million, which represents the fair market value of the inducement shares. We may negotiate similar exchanges for our outstanding convertible notes from time to time in the future, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we issue inducement shares as part of any future exchanges, we expect to record additional non cash charges. As of December 31, 2001, the total amount outstanding under the 2.25% convertible notes was $204.1 million and $212.8 million for the 6.25% convertible notes. February 2000 Convertible Notes. In February 2000, we issued 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. The 5.0% convertible notes are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $51.50 per share. The indenture under which the 5.0% convertible notes are outstanding does not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of debt or the repurchase of our equity securities or any financial covenants. We may not redeem the 5.0% convertible notes prior to February 20, 2003. Thereafter, we can redeem the 5.0% convertible notes, at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price initially of 102.50% of the principal amount. The redemption price declines ratably immediately after February 15 of each following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2006. We are also required to pay accrued and unpaid interest in all redemptions of notes. Holders may require us to repurchase all or any of the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We may, at our option, elect to pay the repurchase price in cash or shares of Class A common stock or any combination thereof. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase the notes for cash. The total amount outstanding under the 5.0% convertible notes as of December 31, 2001 was $450.0 million. Other Long Term Debt. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $250.1 million of other long term debt, including capital lease obligations and mortgage indebtedness. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 35 Liquidity Table For Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2001 (in thousands): Cash Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Total Long term debt*....................... $ 1,579 $345,450 $567,758 $2,470,201 $3,384,988 Capital lease obligations............. 11,006 22,458 22,204 121,304 176,972 Operating leases...................... 163,178 235,688 136,706 383,610 919,182 Pending acquisitions.................. 30,000 30,000 Total contractual cash obligations. $205,763 $603,596 $726,668 $2,975,115 $4,511,142 * The holders of our convertible notes have the the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity dates in 2009 and 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2001, we were party to various arrangements relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements. We expect that for the foreseeable future we will have substantial leverage from our bank borrowings, other debt and capitalized leases. FACTORS AFFECTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are the demand for antennae space on wireless communication towers and for related services, our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully realize our operating efficiencies. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities contain borrowing ratio covenants that limit our ability to borrow funds. Our credit facilities contain four financial tests: . a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2001, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 7.75 to 1.00, decreasing to 7.50 to 1.00 on January 1, 2002, to 7.00 to 1.00 on April 1, 2002, to 6.75 to 1.00 on July 1, 2002, to 6.50 to 1.00 at October 1, 2002, and with additional reductions every six months thereafter; . a pro forma debt service test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Pro Forma Debt Service) requires us to maintain a ratio of not greater than 1.10 to 1.00; . an interest coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). As of December 31, 2001, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1.00 through June 30, 2002, increasing by 0.25 on July 1, 2002 and October 1, 2002, and by 0.50 on January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2004; and . a fixed charge coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges) which begins in 2003 and requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. Since our credit facilities are with certain of our subsidiaries, our parent company debt (the senior notes and the convertible notes) is not included in the computations of any of the tests, except in the case of the pro forma debt service test in which case interest includes the amount of funds that we will require to be distributed by our subsidiaries to pay interest on our senior notes and our convertible notes. Annualized Operating Cash Flow is based, among other things, on four times the Operating Cash Flow for the most recent quarter of our tower rental and management business and trailing 12 months for our other businesses and corporate general and administrative expenses. In the case of the leverage ratio, we may include the Operating Cash Flow from Brazil and Mexico only to the extent of 10% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow and we receive credit for only 75% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow from our services and Verestar businesses. 36 As of December 31, 2001, we were in compliance with these borrowing ratio covenants. Senior Notes. Our senior note indenture restricts us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our Consolidated Debt is not greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. However, we are permitted, even if we are not in compliance with the ratio, to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to the greater of $2.65 billion or a formula based on the number of towers we own and our Non Tower Cash Flow. Even if not in compliance with the ratio, we are also permitted to, among other things, have certain types of capital leases and to refund our convertible notes. For these purposes, Consolidated Debt means all debt, including guarantees, of our parent company and all of our restricted subsidiaries, which presently include all of them, other than Verestar and its subsidiaries, and the aggregate liquidation value of Disqualified Stock. Disqualified Stock means capital stock maturing, mandatorily redeemable, or redeemable at the holders option, prior to 91 days after the maturity of the senior notes. Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow is substantially similar to the definition of Annualized Operating Cash Flow, as defined in the credit facilities, except it applies to our parent company and our restricted subsidiaries. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. CASH FLOWS SUMMARY For the year ended December 31, 2001, cash flows provided by operating activities were $26.1 million, as compared to $37.1 million used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000. This change is primarily related to an overall reduction in our investment in working capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, cash flows used for investing activities were $1.4 billion, as compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash expended for mergers and acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2001, cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.4 billion, as compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in the aggregate net cash inflows from bank borrowings and equity offerings, offset by an increase in proceeds from the issue of debt securities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants disclose their most "critical accounting policies" in "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Further, "critical accounting policies" are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of "critical accounting policies". . Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion methodology. Under the percentage of completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage of completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be 37 revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. . Income Taxes. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2001, we provided a valuation allowance primarily related to our state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $56.3 million. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, we believe our net deferred tax asset will be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. . Impairment of Assets. We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded impairment charges relating to our long lived assets of approximately $11.6 million. Those charges are reflected in depreciation and amortization in our 2001 consolidated statement of operations. . Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. As of December 31, 2001, all of our investments were in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for their securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. 38 During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded impairment charges on our investments of $31.6 million. These charges are reflected in loss (gain) on investments in our consolidated statement of operations. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page F 1 of this annual report where our significant accounting policies are discussed. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On January 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Our 2001 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133. The 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the applicable literature for derivatives and hedging instruments in effect at that time. The cumulative effect of adopting this statement resulted in a charge to other comprehensive loss of $7.9 million (net of a tax benefit of $4.2 million) In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 38 "Accounting for Pre acquisition Contingencies" and eliminates pooling of interest accounting for business combinations. SFAS No. 141 also includes enhanced criteria for identifying intangible assets separately from goodwill. The requirements of SFAS No. 141 were effective for any business combination consummated by us subsequent to June 30, 2001. We did not consummate any acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001 that gave rise to goodwill. SFAS No. 142 supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets", and requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 is expected to reduce our annual amortization of goodwill by approximately $90.0 million. We are in the process of assessing the transitional impairment test and the related valuation of goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for our company. However, upon completion of the transitional impairment test, it is likely we will record a non cash impairment charge in our statement of operations related to Verestar. Although the amount of the charge has not been determined, goodwill related to Verestar was approximately $185.0 million as of December 31, 2001. We will reflect this charge, if necessary, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our 2002 statement of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of". The statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. We implemented SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption of this statement was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 39 INFORMATION PRESENTED PURSUANT TO THE INDENTURE FOR OUR 9 3/8% SENIOR NOTES The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain reporting requirements contained in our senior note indenture.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps, swaps, and collars pursuant to our policies. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we increased our borrowings under our credit facilities by approximately $95.0 million. In addition, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion of our senior notes issued at 100% of their face amount. The proceeds from the above were used to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions. In the short term, we invested any unused proceeds in marketable debt securities, commercial paper and cash and cash equivalents. In June 2001 we entered into an interest rate collar agreement with a total notional amount of $47.5 million expiring in June 2003. In August 2001 we acquired an aggregate of $82.5 million face amount ($61.6 million carrying amount) of our 2.25% convertible notes for shares of our Class A common stock. Lastly, in November 2001, we terminated an interest rate collar agreement with a total notional amount of $185.0 million originally expiring in May 2002, and simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of $185.0 million expiring in November 2003. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, swaps, collars and swaptions, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our foreign operations in 2001 and 2000 were not significant. Accordingly, foreign currency risk has not been material for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
