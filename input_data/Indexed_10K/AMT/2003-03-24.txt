ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading Critical Accounting Policies on page 40. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, we acquired various communications sites, service businesses and satellite and fiber network access related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $55.7 million, $827.2 million, and $1.8 billion, respectively. Our results of operations only reflect the acquired towers and businesses in the periods following their respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2001, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring expense, development expense and impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment also includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar (which previously comprised our entire satellite and fiber network access services segment) by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies (previously included in our network development services segment) and two office buildings (previously included in our rental and management segment). In July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components (previously included in our network development services segment). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods reported in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 As of December 31, 2002, we owned or operated approximately 14,600 communications sites, as compared to approximately 14,500 communications sites as of December 31, 2001. The acquisitions and construction completed throughout 2001 and, to a lesser extent, 2002, have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $113.6 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $110.3 million. 24 Table of Contents Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $548.9 million, an increase of $113.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2001 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2001. The 4,270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2001 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2001. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue, which drives our core business, is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $239.5 million, a decrease of $110.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation, tower maintenance services and radio frequency engineering services, resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $894.7 million, a decrease of $89.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $95.2 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in depreciation and amortization of $29.1 million, as well as decreases in corporate general and administrative expense of $2.1 million and development expense of $2.0 million. These decreases were offset by increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $16.7 million, coupled with increases in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets of $16.5 million and restructuring expense of $5.4 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $228.5 million, an increase of $16.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 3,700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2002). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 570 towers acquired/constructed in 2002. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $334.3 million, an increase of $96.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $217.7 million, a decrease of $95.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, coupled with decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. 25 Table of Contents Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $21.8 million, a decrease of $15.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by a reduction in personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs as a result of restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2002 and 2001. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $316.9 million, a decrease of $29.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which reduced amortization expense by approximately $70.0 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to the acquisition/construction of approximately $236.9 million of property and equipment in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on the $1.4 billion of property and equipment acquired in 2001. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $24.3 million, a decrease of $2.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease is a result of cost reduction efforts in adminstrative and information technology functions related to our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring Expense In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of this continuing initiative, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating $10.6 million, an increase of $5.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we have completed our restructuring initiatives to consolidate operations and do not expect future charges associated with this restructuring. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $5.9 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site data gathering and acquisition costs as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments and Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets Impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $90.7 million, an increase of $16.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets of approximately $35.1 million related to the write down and sale of certain non core towers, partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges of approximately $22.4 million related to the write off of construction in progress costs associated with sites that we no longer plan to build. 26 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3.5 million, a decrease of $25.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash primarily attributable to a decrease in cash on hand during 2002, coupled with lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $255.6 million, a decrease of $12.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease, $26.6 million, resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our senior notes (issued in January 2001) and a reduction in capitalized interest of $9.5 million as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $25.6 million, a decrease of $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our Mexican subsidiary. Loss on Term Loan Cancellation In January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees associated with that component. No similar charge was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2001. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a non cash charge of $26.3 million. These charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. No similar charge was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2002. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $64.6 million, a decrease of $35.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective tax rate was 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of $27.5 million recorded in 2002 in connection with our plan to implement a tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses (the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing this strategy). This decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill (the majority of which is non deductible for tax purposes) in 2002 in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our state net operating losses, capital losses, tax planning strategy and foreign items. The effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and capital losses and other non deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. 27 Table of Contents SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2002, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing our tax planning strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or accelerate the utilization of losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of our MTS Components operations. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, $(249.9) million and $(60.2) million, net of tax, as loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 also includes a net loss on disposal from the sale of MTS Components and the two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million, net of a tax benefit. All of these businesses held for sale as of December 31, 2002 and a subsidiary of Verestar were sold in the first quarter of 2003. We expect to sell the remaining portion of Verestar by December 31, 2003. Extraordinary Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net In February 2002, we repaid the $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican Credit Facility with borrowings under our credit facilities. As a result of such repayment, we recognized an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.1 million, net of an income tax benefit of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. No similar losses were recorded in 2001. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. The non cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. 28 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 As of December 31, 2001, we owned or operated approximately 14,500 communications sites, as compared to approximately 11,000 communications sites as of December 31, 2000. The acquisitions and construction completed in 2001 and 2000 have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Year Ended December 31, Amount of Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2001 2000 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 435,302 $ 270,298 $ 165,004 61 % Network development services 349,848 239,616 110,232 46 Total operating revenues 785,150 509,914 275,236 54 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 211,811 136,300 75,511 55 Network development services 312,926 210,313 102,613 49 Depreciation and amortization 346,020 241,211 104,809 43 Corporate general and administrative expense 26,478 14,958 11,520 77 Restructuring expense 5,236 5,236 N/A Development expense 7,895 14,433 (6,538 ) (45 ) Impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets 74,260 74,260 N/A Total operating expenses 984,626 617,215 367,411 60 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense of $1,160 and $1,047, respectively 14,377 12,679 1,698 13 Interest income 28,622 15,954 12,668 79 Interest expense (267,825 ) (151,702 ) (116,123 ) 77 Loss on investments and other expense (38,797 ) (2,434 ) (36,363 ) 1,494 Note conversion expense (26,336 ) (16,968 ) (9,368 ) 55 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (318 ) (202 ) (116 ) 57 Income tax benefit 99,875 65,897 33,978 52 Loss from discontinued operations, net (60,216 ) (6,213 ) (54,003 ) 869 Extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt, net (4,338 ) 4,338 N/A Net loss $ (450,094 ) $ (194,628 ) $ (255,466 ) 131 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $785.2 million, an increase of $275.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted from increases in rental and management revenues of $165.0 million and increases in network development services revenue of $110.2 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $435.3 million, an increase of $165.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2000 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2000. The 9,900 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2000 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and 29 Table of Contents international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2000. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $349.8 million, an increase of $110.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The significant growth in revenues during 2001 resulted primarily from increased volume related to construction management, antennae and line installation and related collocation services, and tower site maintenance. The increase was also driven by a full year of revenue in 2001 related to acquisitions consummated in 2000, primarily a steel fabrication business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue related to radio frequency engineering services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $984.6 million, an increase of $367.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was attributable to depreciation and amortization of $104.8 million, increases in expenses within rental and management of $75.5 million, network development services of $102.6 million, restructuring expense of $5.2 million, corporate general and administrative expense of $11.5 million and impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets of $74.3 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in development expense of $6.5 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $211.8 million, an increase of $75.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2001 for the more than 6,200 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2000 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2001). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2001 for the more than 3,700 towers acquired/constructed in 2001. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $237.9 million, an increase of $91.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $312.9 million, an increase of $102.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from overall increases in volume (as discussed above), incremental expenses related to the operations of acquisitions and increases in overhead costs necessary to support both internal construction and external sales. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $36.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of services, as discussed above. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $346.0 million, an increase of $104.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The principal component of the increase is an increase 30 Table of Contents in depreciation expense of $86.7 million. This is primarily a result of our purchase, construction and acquisition of approximately $1.4 billion of property and equipment during 2001 and a full year of depreciation on acquisitions and additions made in 2000. The other component of the increase is increased amortization of $31.1 million, resulting from our recording and amortizing approximately $184.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions consummated during 2001, and a full year of amortization on goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 2000. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $26.5 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase is a result of increased personnel and information technology costs to support our overall growth, coupled with expenses incurred to implement a new company wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Restructuring Expense In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operating and administrative functions. As part of that initiative, we incurred employee separation costs relating to the termination of approximately 525 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with closing certain facilities, aggregating $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. No similar charges were incurred in 2000. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $7.9 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site, data gathering and acquisition integration in 2001. Impairments and Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets Impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $74.3 million. The increase is attributed to non cash impairment charges aggregating $11.7 million related to the write down of certain non core towers and a non cash impairment charge of $62.6 related to the write off of construction in progress costs associated with sites that we no longer planned to build. No similar charges were incurred in 2000. Interest Income, TV Azteca, Net Interest income, TV Azteca, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $14.4 million, an increase of $1.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted from interest earned on the entire principal amount of the note, $119.8 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000 when less than the entire principal amount of the note was outstanding for the year. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $28.6 million, an increase of $12.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on invested cash on hand, resulting principally from the sale of our senior notes in January 2001. 31 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $267.8 million, an increase of $116.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase, $113.0 million, resulted primarily from increased borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and the issue of $1.0 billion of senior notes in January 2001, offset by a decrease in interest rates under our credit facilities. The remaining component of the increase represented increases in interest on capital leases and other notes payable and incremental deferred financing amortization. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $38.8 million, an increase of $36.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from the write off of our investment in US Wireless of $23.4 million, coupled with additional investment impairment losses of $4.3 million and increases in losses on equity investments of $6.6 million. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a non cash charge of $26.3 million. In similar transactions during the year ended December 31, 2000, we acquired a portion of our 6.25% and 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, we recorded a non cash charge of $17.0 million during that year. These charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $99.9 million, an increase of $34.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The primary reason for the increase is a result of the increase in our loss from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in amortization of non deductible intangible items. The effective tax rate on our loss from continuing operations was 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to certain non deductible amounts for tax purposes such as the valuation allowances related to state net operating losses, capital losses and the effects of other non deductible items such as goodwill amortization and note conversion expense. The effective tax rate in 2000 differs from the statutory rate due to the recording of valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and other non deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2001, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards and capital losses. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. As of December 31, 2001, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments 32 Table of Contents reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that its net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $740.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2021. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, $(60.2) million and $(6.2) million, net of tax, as loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Extraordinary Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net We incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt, net in 2000 of $4.3 million. The losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and restatement of our primary credit facilities ($3.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $2.0 million) and our early retirement of debt ($1.3 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.9 million). No comparable losses were recorded in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Overview Our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity and debt offerings, proceeds from the sale of non core assets and cash on hand. We have used those funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist primarily of operational needs, debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and service our cash interest expense. We believe cash flow from operations in 2003 will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest payments for that year. In January 2003, we completed an offering (discount note offering) of approximately $420.0 million, consisting of 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 (discount notes) of ATI and warrants to purchase 11.4 million shares of our Class A common stock. In connection with the financing, we obtained an amendment of our credit facilities (credit agreement amendment). Pursuant to the credit agreement amendment, we repaid $200.0 million of term loans outstanding under our credit facilities and reduced our revolving loan commitments by $225.0 million to $425.0 million. That amendment also gives us the right to use $217.0 million, which we have placed in escrow for that purpose, to purchase our 2.25% convertible notes on or prior to October 22, 2003, at which time the holders have the right to put those notes to us. We may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to the 2.25% convertible notes through the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock (subject to certain restrictions) on October 22, 2003 pursuant to the put right or, prior to that time, pursuant to a limited number of privately negotiated transactions. We also may use any escrowed funds not used to purchase 2.25% convertible notes to purchase, prior to June 30, 2004, our other convertible notes and our senior notes. We are required to use any funds remaining in escrow on June 30, 2004 to reduce our term loans under the credit facilities. 33 Table of Contents We expect our 2003 capital needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $215.0 million, repayment of approximately $54.4 million of term loans under our amended credit facilities and up to $217.0 million of 2.25% convertible notes (assuming all holders exercise their put rights); capital expenditures of between $50.0 and $75.0 million; and tower acquisitions of approximately $74.0 million. We expect to meet those needs through a combination of cash on hand of approximately $127.3 million at December 31, 2002, remaining net proceeds from the discount note offering of approximately $197.0 million (after the repayment of $200.0 million of term loans), cash generated by operations, proceeds from sales of non core assets, and nominal, if any, borrowings under our credit facilities. Due to the risk factors outlined above, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our capital needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities. Uses of Liquidity Our principal uses of liquidity, in addition to funding operations, are debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. Debt Service. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding debt of approximately $3.5 billion, consisting of the following: credit facilities $1.5 billion; senior notes $1.0 billion; convertible notes, net of discount $873.6 million; and other $81.0 million (primarily capital leases and notes payable). Our debt instruments require us to make current interest payments and significant principal payments at their respective maturities. In addition, in the case of our credit facilities, we must make scheduled amortization payments in increasing amounts designed to repay the loans at maturity. During 2003, we will be required to repay approximately $13.6 million of the amended term loans each quarter. Prior to maturity, there are no mandatory redemption provisions for cash in the senior notes, the convertible notes or the discount notes. The holders of the convertible notes, however, have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to maturity, but we may at our election pay the repurchase price in cash or by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions in the applicable indenture. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase convertible notes for cash, except that we now have the right to use up to $217.0 million to prepay or repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes and, to the extent we do not and are not otherwise required to do so, to prepay or repurchase prior to June 30, 2004, any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes. Tower Construction and Acquisition Needs. We have significantly reduced our planned level of tower construction and acquisitions for 2003 from prior years. As a result, we anticipate that our liquidity needs for new tower development and acquisitions during 2003 will be significantly less than in previous periods. Construction. In 2003, we expect to build between 100 and 150 towers (including broadcast towers) and expect total capital expenditures to be between $50.0 million and $75.0 million. Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2002, we were committed to make expenditures of approximately $74.0 million for pending acquisitions, principally the NII Holdings transaction, of which approximately $24.0 million had been paid as of March 4, 2003. Sources of Liquidity We expect to meet our cash requirements for 2003 through a combination of cash on hand, net proceeds from the discount note offering, cash generated by operations, proceeds from sales of non core assets, and nominal, if any, borrowings under our credit facilities. 34 Table of Contents Cash on Hand. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately $127.3 million in cash on hand. As a result of the net proceeds from the discount note offering and the $200.0 million repayment of term loans under our credit facilities described above, we had approximately $324.3 million of cash on hand, including $217.0 million in escrow. As explained above, while we have the right to use up to $217.0 million of the escrowed funds to purchase the 2.25% convertible notes, we may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to those notes through the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock. Cash Generated by Operations. We expect our cash flow needs by segment for 2003 to be as follows (excluding cash requirements to fund debt service, as interest expense is not allocated to our segments). Our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2003 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures. We expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt. Effective December 31, 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our satellite and fiber network access services segment. Accordingly, these operations are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The businesses in our former satellite and fiber network access services segment are expected to be near cash flow break even from operations, but may require additional sources of liquidity to fund minimal capital expenditures until final disposition. In addition, we currently provide financial guarantees of up to $12.0 million for certain Verestar contractual obligations. Depending on the terms of any disposition, we may continue to be obligated with respect to those guarantees. Divestiture Proceeds. We are continuing to pursue strategic divestitures of non core assets in an effort to enhance efficiency and increase our focus on our core tower operations. Through March 4, 2003, we completed approximately $203.5 million in non core asset sales (including approximately $78.5 million subsequent to December 31, 2002) related to (a) our two components businesses, (b) a Verestar subsidiary, (c) our corporate office building and other real estate assets, and (d) non core towers. Proceeds from those and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to fund capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. We anticipate approximately $50.0 million of proceeds from additional sales of non core assets during the remainder of 2003. Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2002, we had drawn $160.0 million of the $650.0 million revolving line of credit under our credit facilities (the only component of our credit facilities which is not fully drawn). We also had outstanding letters of credit of $19.2 million as of December 31, 2002. Availability under our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2002, was $470.8 million, net of $19.2 million of outstanding letters of credit. The credit agreement amendment decreased the revolving loan commitment to $425.0 million, thereby reducing availability to $245.8 million. Cash Flows Summary For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows provided by operating activities were $105.1 million, as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash flow generated from our rental and management segment, coupled with a decrease in our overall investment in working capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows used for investing activities were $115.3 million, as compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash expended for acquisitions, property and equipment and construction activities, coupled with an increase in proceeds received from the sale of non core businesses and assets. For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows provided by financing activities were $101.4 million, as compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. 35 Table of Contents Certain Contractual Commitments Below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities, discount notes, senior notes, convertible notes and certain other contractual obligations. It is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, see Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity. For more information about our obligations, commitments and contingencies, see our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for principal payments and contractual maturity dates as of December 31, 2002. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities (prior to the February 2003 credit agreement amendment), provided us with a borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion (after giving effect to the amendment $1.575 billion). Our principal operating subsidiaries (other than Verestar) are the borrowers under our credit facilities. Borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with certain financial ratios as described below. Our credit facilities currently include: a $650.0 million (as amended $425.0 million) revolving credit facility, of which $160.0 million was drawn and against which $19.2 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding on December 31, 2002, maturing on June 30, 2007; an $850.0 million (as amended $725.0 million) multi draw term loan A, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2002, maturing on June 30, 2007; and a $500.0 million (as amended $425.0 million) term loan B, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2002, maturing on December 31, 2007. We are required under our credit facilities to make scheduled amortization payments in increasing amounts designed to repay the loans at maturity. During 2003, we will be required to repay approximately $13.6 million of the amended term loans each quarter. We and our restricted subsidiaries, as well as Verestar and its subsidiaries, have guaranteed all of the loans under our credit facilities. We have secured the loans by liens on substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries, as well as Verestar and its subsidiaries, and substantially all outstanding capital stock and other debt and equity interests of all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The amended credit facilities permit us to use up to $217.0 million to repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes. We may use any escrowed funds not used to purchase 2.25% convertible notes to purchase, prior to June 30, 2004, our other convertible notes and our senior notes. We are required to use any escrowed funds remaining at June 30, 2004 to reduce our term loans under the credit facilities. Discount Notes and Warrants. In January 2003, American Towers, Inc. (ATI), our principal operating subsidiary, issued 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 with a principal amount at maturity of $808.0 million. The discount notes will mature on August 1, 2008. No cash interest is payable on the discount notes. Instead, the accreted value of each discount note increases between the date of original issuance and the maturity date at a rate of 12.25% per annum. The discount notes rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of ATI, the sister guarantors and their domestic subsidiaries and structurally senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness. The discount notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by us and all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, other than Verestar and its subsidiaries. As part of the discount notes offering, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11.4 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. The warrants and the discount notes were originally issued together as 808,000 units, each unit consisting of (1) one discount note having a principal value of $1,000 36 Table of Contents at maturity, and (2) one warrant to purchase 14.0953 shares of our Class A common stock at $0.01 per share. The warrants are exercisable at any time on or after January 29, 2006 and will expire on August 1, 2008. At the time of issuance, the warrants represented approximately 5.5% of our outstanding common stock (assuming exercise of all warrants). The holders of the discount notes and the warrants have registration rights requiring us to file registration statements with respect to the discount notes and warrants and subjecting us to penalties if such registration statements are not timely filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 9 3/8% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of 9 3/8% senior notes. The senior notes mature on February 1, 2009. Interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. The senior note indenture does not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the senior notes prior to maturity. October 1999 Convertible Notes. In October 1999, we issued 6.25% convertible notes due 2009 in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million and 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 at an issue price of $300.1 million, representing 70.52% of their principal amount at maturity of $425.5 million. The difference between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity of the 2.25% convertible notes will be accreted each year at the rate of 6.25% per annum as interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. The 6.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.40 per share. The 2.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.00 per share. The indentures under which the convertible notes were issued do not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the convertible notes prior to maturity. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 6.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2006 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003 at $802.93, which is its issue price plus accreted original issue discount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Based on the principal amount of the 2.25% notes outstanding as of December 31, 2002, we may be required to repurchase up to $216.7 million (accreted through October 22, 2003) principal amount of our 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003, if all the holders exercise this put right. We may, subject to certain conditions in the applicable indenture, elect to pay the repurchase price of each series of convertible notes in cash or shares of our Class A common stock, or any combination thereof. The amended credit facilities permit us to use up to $217.0 million of escrowed cash to purchase the 2.25% convertible notes, whether pursuant to the holders put rights on October 22, 2003, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Notwithstanding this right, we will continue to evaluate financing opportunities with respect to our convertible notes generally and, in particular, with respect to the put right of the 2.25% convertible notes. Since we issued the convertible notes, we have successfully reduced the principal amount outstanding of these convertible notes by entering into, from time to time, a limited number of privately negotiated agreements with noteholders to induce them to convert their convertible notes into shares of our Class A common stock. As a result of such conversions, we acquired $155.6 million principal amount (face) of the 2.25% convertible notes and $87.3 million of the 6.25% convertible notes during 2000 and 2001. We may seek, from time to time, to reduce further our indebtedness through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. If the put option of the holders of the 2.25% convertible notes is satisfied by other means or if it is not exercised in full by the holders, we may use any remaining escrowed funds to pay, prior to June 30, 2004, any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes. As of December 31, 2002, the total amounts outstanding under the 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes were $210.9 million and $212.7 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents February 2000 Convertible Notes. In February 2000, we issued 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. The 5.0% convertible notes are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $51.50 per share. The indenture under which the 5.0% convertible notes are outstanding does not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the convertible notes prior to maturity. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or any of the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We may, subject to certain conditions in the indenture, elect to pay the repurchase price in cash or shares of Class A common stock or any combination thereof. The total amount outstanding under the 5.0% convertible notes as of December 31, 2002 was $450.0 million. Other Long Term Debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately $81.0 million of other long term debt, including $47.2 million of capital lease obligations and $33.8 million of mortgage indebtedness and other notes payable. Tower Construction and Acquisition. As of December 31, 2002, we were party to various arrangements relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we were committed to acquire approximately 400 communication sites for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $74.0 million, of which $24.0 million had been funded as of March 4, 2003. ATC Separation. In connection with the ATC Separation, we agreed to reimburse CBS for any tax liabilities incurred by American Radio as a result of the transaction. Upon completion of the final American Radio tax returns, the amount of these tax liabilities was determined and paid by us. We continue to be obligated under a tax indemnification agreement with CBS, however, until June 30, 2003, subject to the extension of federal and applicable state statutes of limitations. We are currently aware that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in the process of auditing certain tax returns filed by CBS and its predecessors, including those that relate to American Radio and the ATC Separation transaction. In the event that the IRS imposes additional tax liabilities on American Radio relating to the ATC Separation, we would be obligated to reimburse CBS for such liabilities. We cannot currently anticipate or estimate the potential additional tax liabilities, if any, that may be imposed by the IRS, however, such amounts could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are not aware of any material obligations relating to this tax indemnity as of December 31, 2002. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided for in the consolidated financial statements relating to this indemnification. Liquidity Table For Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash (related to continuing operations) as of December 31, 2002 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations * $ 3,417,459 $ 267,636 $ 436,700 $ 1,713,123 $ 1,000,000 Capital lease obligations 47,220 2,506 3,108 183 41,423 Operating lease obligations 759,802 81,487 133,966 98,373 445,976 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 73,851 73,851 Total $ 4,928,332 $ 425,480 $ 573.774 $ 1,811,679 $ 1,487,399 * The holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity dates in 2009 and 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions discussed elsewhere in this annual report. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003 of approximately $210.9 million as of December 31, 2002 has been classified as an obligation due in Less than 1 year. The obligations with respect to the right of the holders to put the 6.25% convertible notes ($212.7 million) and 5% notes ($450.0 million) on October 22, 2006 and February 20, 2007, respectively, have been classified as an obligation due in 3 5 years as of December 31, 2002. 38 Table of Contents The above table does not include approximately $116.9 million of aggregate principal payments for Verestar capital leases that are included in liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2002 and financial guarantees of up to $12.0 million that we may be obligated to pay in connection with certain Verestar contractual obligations. Such amounts have been excluded from the table as we expect to sell the remaining portion of Verestar by December 31, 2003. The above table also excludes certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2002, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are the demand for antennae space on wireless communications towers and for related services, our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities, as amended in February 2003, contain certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent, to incur any debt other than that presently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. Our credit facilities, as amended, contain five financial tests: a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00, increasing to 6.25 to 1.00 at January 1, 2003, decreasing to 6.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2003, to 5.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2003, to 5.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 5.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 5.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 4.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004, to 4.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005, to 4.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2005 and to 4.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005 and thereafter; a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of January 1, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.90 to 1.00, decreasing to 4.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2003, to 4.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2003, to 4.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2003, to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 3.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 3.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004 and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005 and thereafter; a pro forma debt service test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Pro Forma Debt Service). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00; an interest coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, increasing by 0.50 on each of January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2004; and a fixed charge coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges). As of December 31, 2003, we will be required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. The amended credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. Because the credit facilities are with certain of our subsidiaries, including ATI, our senior notes and convertible notes are not included in the computations of any of the tests, except in the case of the pro forma debt service and fixed charge coverage tests in which case interest includes the amount of funds that we need our subsidiaries to distribute to us so we can pay interest on our senior notes and our convertible notes. Annualized Operating Cash Flow is based, among other things, on four times the Operating Cash Flow for the most recent quarter of our tower rental and management business and trailing 12 months for our other businesses and for corporate general and administrative expenses. In the case of the leverage ratio, we may include the Operating Cash Flow from Brazil and Mexico only to the extent of 10% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow and we receive credit for only 75% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow from our services businesses. 39 Table of Contents We were in compliance with the borrowing ratio covenants in effect as of December 31, 2002, and as amended by the February 2003 amendment. 9 3/8% Senior Note Indenture. The senior note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries (which includes all of our subsidiaries other than Verestar and its subsidiaries) must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would also constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indenture restricts us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt (which excludes debt of Verestar and its subsidiaries but includes the liquidation value of certain preferred stock) is not greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. However, we are permitted, even if we are not in compliance with the ratio, to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $2.65 billion. Even if not in compliance with the ratio, we are also permitted to, among other things, have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance our convertible notes, subject to certain requirements. Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow is substantially similar to the definition of Annualized Operating Cash Flow, as defined in the credit facilities, except it applies to us and our subsidiaries (other than Verestar and its subsidiaries). 12.25% Discount Notes. The discount note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on the ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would also constitute a default. Specifically, the discount note indenture restricts ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. However, ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. They are also permitted, among other things, to have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance existing indebtedness, subject to certain requirements. Convertible Notes. The indentures under which our convertible notes are outstanding do not contain any restrictions on, among other things, the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions, the incurrence of debt, or liens or the repurchase of our equity securities, or any financial covenants. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants disclose their most critical accounting policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Further, critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies. We reviewed our policies for the year ended December 31, 2002 and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies. With the exception of the asset impairment charges and the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we did not make any changes to those policies during the year ended December 31, 2002. 40 Table of Contents Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2002, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $118.6 million primarily related to our state operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 related to implementing a tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses (the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing this strategy). We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or accelerate the utilization of our losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non core assets held for sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. The impairment test is comprised of two steps. The initial step is designed to identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing an estimate of fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, a second step is performed, which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and former SFNA segment and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment. 41 Table of Contents We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to our former SFNA segment was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We also completed our annual impairment testing in December 2002 related to the goodwill of the tower rental and management reporting unit that contains goodwill and Kline (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and determined that goodwill was not impaired. We obtained an independent third party appraisal of the tower and rental management reporting unit that contains goodwill and utilized market information to value Kline. We will perform our annual goodwill impairment test in December of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion methodology. Under the percentage of completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage of completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page F 1 of this annual report where our significant accounting policies are discussed. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs. The requirements of SFAS No. 143 are effective for us as of January 1, 2003. We will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2003 and do not expect the impact of adopting this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 42 Table of Contents In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statement Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item, but rather will generally be classified as part of other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations. Any such gains or losses classified as extraordinary items in prior periods will be reclassified in future financial statement presentations upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 145 for all reporting periods subsequent to January 1, 2003. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting For Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The statement requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of the commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The requirements of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after January 1, 2003. We will apply the provisions of this statement to all restructuring activity initiated after January 1, 2003. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS No. 123, which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. In addition, the statement mandates certain new disclosures that are incremental to those required by SFAS No. 123. We will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. As such, we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We have adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002. (See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements). In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation for Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 which requires all variable interest entities (VIEs) to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests, but not the majority. FIN 46 is effective for all VIEs created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this interpretation is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indenture of Our 9 3/8% Senior Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our senior notes. This information presents certain of our financial data on a consolidated basis and on a restricted group basis, as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes. All of our subsidiaries are part of the restricted group, except our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar. In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. Pursuant to that plan, the results of the operations related to Verestar are included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and the assets and liabilities of Verestar are included in assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale, respectively, within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. 43 Table of Contents Consolidated Restricted Group Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 (In thousands) Statement of Operations Data: Operating revenues $ 788,420 $ 785,150 $ 788,420 $ 785,150 Operating expenses: Rental and management 228,519 211,811 228,519 211,811 Network development services 217,690 312,926 217,690 312,926 Depreciation and amortization 316,876 346,020 316,876 346,020 Corporate general and administrative expense 24,349 26,478 24,349 26,478 Restructuring expense 10,638 5,236 10,638 5,236 Development expense 5,896 7,895 5,896 7,895 Impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets 90,734 74,260 90,734 74,260 Total operating expenses 894,702 984,626 894,702 984,626 Operating loss from continuing operations (106,282 ) (199,476 ) (106,282 ) (199,476 ) Interest income, TV Azteca, net 13,938 14,377 13,938 14,377 Interest income 3,514 28,622 3,514 28,622 Interest expense (255,645 ) (267,825 ) (255,645 ) (267,825 ) Loss on investments and other expense (25,579 ) (38,797 ) (25,579 ) (38,797 ) Loss on term loan cancellation (7,231 ) (7,231 ) Note conversion expense (26,336 ) (26,336 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,118 ) (318 ) (2,118 ) (318 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (379,403 ) (489,753 ) (379,403 ) (489,753 ) Income tax benefit 64,634 99,875 64,634 99,875 Loss from continuing operations before extraordinary losses and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (314,769 ) (389,878 ) (314,769 ) (389,878 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (263,427 ) (60,216 ) (21,852 ) (9,251 ) Loss before extraordinary losses and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ (578,196 ) $ (450,094 ) $ (336,621 ) $ (399,129 ) December 31, 2002 Consolidated Restricted Group (In thousands) Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 127,292 $ 127,292 Assets held for sale 234,724 39,026 Property and equipment, net 2,734,885 2,734,885 Total assets 5,662,203 5,466,505 Long term obligations, including current portion 3,464,679 3,464,679 Liabilities held for sale 165,006 2,525 Total stockholders equity 1,740,323 1,740,323 44 Table of Contents Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of Our 9 3/8% Senior Notes and Our 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our senior and discount notes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps, swaps, and collars pursuant to our policies. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we increased our borrowings under our credit facilities by $65.0 million. We also terminated two swaps with aggregate notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and caps with total notional amounts of $365.0 million expired. In addition, swaps with total notional amounts of $30.0 million and a collar with a total notional amount of $95.0 million expired. Lastly, we entered into four cap agreements with total notional amounts of $500.0 million. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, swaps and collars, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the Base Rate plus margin (as defined). The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2002 for the credit facilities was 4.48%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 4.41%. The 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% convertible notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% convertible notes bear 46 Table of Contents interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% senior notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.09% to 12.00%, payable monthly. As of December 31, 2001 variable rate debt consists of our credit facilities ($1.45 billion) and fixed rate debt consists of the 2.25% convertible notes ($204.2 million) and 6.25% convertible notes ($212.7 million), the 5.0% convertible notes ($450.0 million), the 9 3/8% senior notes ($1.0 billion) and other debt of $250.1 million. The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2001 for the credit facilities was 4.76%. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 7.26%. The 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% convertible notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% convertible notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% senior notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.09% to 12.00%, payable monthly. (b) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contract notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (c) Includes notional amounts of $125,000, $250,000 and $125,000 that will expire in May, June and July 2004, respectively. (d) Includes notional amounts of $215,000 and $185,000 that will expire in February and November 2003, respectively. (e) Includes notional amounts of $185,000 and $47,500 that will expire in May and June 2003, respectively. (f) Includes notional amount of $364,980 that expired in February 2002. (g) Includes notional amount of $30,000 that expired in March 2002. (h) Includes notional amounts of $75,000, $290,000 and $185,000 that will expire in January, February and November 2003, respectively. (i) Includes notional amount of $95,000 that expired in July 2002. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our foreign operations, which primarily include Mexico, have not been significant to date. The remeasurement loss (gain) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated $3,713,000, $(207,000) and 11,000, respectively.
