ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates on page 38. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization; corporate general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods presented in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 86.7% and 80.7% of our total revenues and approximately 98.4% and 96.6% of our segment operating profit for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, and acquiring and building additional tower sites. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our strategic focus on our rental and management segment, the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years (fifteen to twenty for broadcast tenants). Accordingly, a significant majority of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2003 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable agreement. The primary factor affecting our ability to lease additional space on our existing towers is the rate at which wireless carriers choose to deploy capital to improve and expand their networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and the infrastructure needed to support these services, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. In 2003, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2002 and ending December 31, 2003, was approximately $50.0 million. Based on our understanding of our customers capital spending and network development plans, we do not expect these trends will change materially in 2004. 22 Table of Contents In 2002 and 2003, we acquired or constructed 580 and 618 towers, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated by the acquired and newly constructed tower sites following their respective dates of acquisition or construction, which affects year to year comparisons. For the year ending December 31, 2003, approximately $28.0 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2002, and approximately $16.0 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2003. Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and allocable selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, maintenance, taxes and utilities. Because our operating expenses generally do not increase significantly when we add additional customers on a tower site, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. Our selling, general and administrative expenses have two major components. The first component consists of expenses necessary to support our site leasing and network development services such as sales and property management functions. The second component consists of expenses incurred to support all of our operations, such as legal, accounting, human resources and other administrative support. In connection with organizational initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to manage our operations more efficiently, these expenses have decreased over these periods, and we expect them to be relatively stable in 2004.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $74.8 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $34.7 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $619.7 million, an increase of $74.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2002 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 1,200 towers acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2002. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue, which drives our core business, is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $95.4 million, a decrease of $34.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decline in revenues during 2003 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation and tower maintenance services, resulting from lower levels of construction activity and reduced demand for related services in the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $683.7 million, a decrease of $106.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The principal components of the decrease were attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $29.6 million and a decrease in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense of $69.7 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $4.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $3.4 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $222.7 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in certain rental and management segment overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in tower expenses related to the 1,200 towers we have acquired/constructed since January 1, 2002 due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2003. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $411.2 million, an increase of $79.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and or constructed towers, coupled with a net reduction in tower expenses, as discussed above. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $88.9 million, a decrease of $29.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, partially offset by decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. 24 Table of Contents Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $6.5 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by expense reductions, as discussed above. Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $26.9 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold approximately 300 non core towers and certain other non core assets and recorded impairment charges to write down certain other non core towers and assets. As a result, we recorded impairment charges and net loss on sale of long lived assets of approximately $19.1 million. We also wrote off approximately $9.2 million of construction in progress costs, primarily associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs (primarily associated with the reorganization of certain functions in our rental and management segment) and facility closing costs aggregating $3.4 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non core towers and recorded impairment charges to write down certain other non core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote off approximately $40.2 million of construction in progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Additionally, in the latter stages of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of these initiatives, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs, aggregating $10.6 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $5.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on restricted cash and investments, resulting principally from our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering in January 2003 and, to a lesser extent, our August 2003 equity offering. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $279.9 million, an increase of $25.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the following: interest expense on our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes, issued in January 2003; our 3.25% convertible notes, issued in August 2003; the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes, issued in November 2003. The increase was partially offset by a net decrease in interest expense on our credit facilities as a result of repayments made during 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our 2.25% and 5.0% convertible notes as a result of repurchases made during 2003 (as discussed below). 25 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facilities and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased certain of our 2.25% convertible and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In February 2002, we repaid $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facilities. As a result of such repayment, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write off of related deferred financing fees. The total of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $29.8 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. This increase was primarily offset by decreased foreign currency transaction losses. We recorded impairment charges on our cost and equity investments, as well as losses on our equity method investments, aggregating $21.2 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $66.1 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate was 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of a $27.5 million valuation allowance that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. This strategy resulted in the filing of tax refund claims with the IRS in 2003. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within one to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs incurred in connection with implementing this strategy. This increase was offset in part by an increase in the valuation allowance in 2003 for capital losses and non deductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non deductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our tax planning strategy discussed above. 26 Table of Contents SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2003, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $156.7 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with the tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.0 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described below, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to sell Verestar by December 31, 2003. In December 2003, Verestar filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased to be included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In August 2003, we consummated the sale of Galaxy. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline by June 30, 2004. In May 2003, we consummated the sale of an office building in Westwood, Massachusetts. In February 2003, pursuant to our original plan to sell Verestar, we sold MTN, a subsidiary of Verestar. In January 2003, we sold Flash Technologies. In March 2003, we consummated the sale of an office building in Schaumburg, Illinois. In December 2002, we consummated the sale of the building in Boston, Massachusetts where we maintain our corporate headquarters. Finally, in July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components. Accordingly, we have presented the results of these operations (including those of Verestar through the date of the bankruptcy filing), approximately $(12.5) million and $(245.2) million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following: (a) an aggregate impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain of Verestars contracts for which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor as of December 31, 2003; (b) an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Klines net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.6 million net loss on the disposal of the office building in Westwood, Massachusetts; (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash Technologies; and (f) a $0.1 million net loss on the sale of the office building in Schaumberg, Illinois. Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes an aggregate net loss on our disposition of MTS Components and two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, the disposal of our Kline business was still a pending transaction. In March 2004, we sold substantially all the net assets of Kline and expect to sell the remaining assets by June 30, 2004. 27 Table of Contents Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. The non cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $113.9 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $93.8 million. 28 Table of Contents Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $544.9 million, an increase of $113.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2001 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2001. The 4,270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2001 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2001. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $130.2 million, a decrease of $93.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation and tower maintenance services, resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $789.8 million, a decrease of $68.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $81.0 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $22.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $4.1 million. These decreases were offset by increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $16.9 million, coupled with an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense of $21.9 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $226.8 million, an increase of $16.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 3,700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2002). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 570 towers acquired/constructed in 2002. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $332.1 million, an increase of $96.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $118.6 million, a decrease of $81.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, coupled with decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $11.6 million, a decrease of $12.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by a reduction in personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs as a result of restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2002 and 2001. 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $312.9 million, a decrease of $22.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which reduced amortization expense by approximately $67.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $236.9 million in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on the $1.4 billion of property and equipment acquired in 2001. Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $30.2 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is attributable to cost reduction efforts in administrative and information technology functions related to our restructuring initiatives, as well as a reduction in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non core towers and recorded impairment charges to write down certain other non core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote off approximately $40.2 million of construction in progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating $10.6 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. This resulted in a significant decrease in new tower construction and more stringent criteria for evaluating tower construction and acquisitions. As a result, we wrote off approximately $62.6 million of construction in progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. We also incurred impairment charges to write down certain non core towers of approximately $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 525 employees (primarily tower development and administrative), as well as facility closing costs, aggregating $5.2 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3.5 million, a decrease of $24.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash primarily attributable to a decrease in cash on hand during 2002, coupled with lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $254.4 million, a decrease of $12.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease, $26.6 million, resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our 9 3/8% senior notes (issued in January 2001) and a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002. 30 Table of Contents Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $25.6 million, a decrease of $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments, offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our Mexican subsidiary. Loss from Retirement of Long Term Obligations In February 2002, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facility. As a result of such repayment, we expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write off of the related deferred financing fees. The aggregate of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a loss on retirement of long term obligations of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This non cash charge represents the fair value of incremental stock issued to note holders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $67.8 million, a decrease of $34.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective tax rate was 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of $27.5 million that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing such strategy. This decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill (the majority of which is non deductible for tax purposes) in 2002 in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, tax planning strategy (as discussed above) and foreign items. The effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to capital losses and other non deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2002, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with our tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax planning strategy, which carries back certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward 31 Table of Contents period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale by December 31, 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of our MTS Components operations. In the first quarter of 2003, we committed to a plan to sell an office building in Westwood, Massachusetts held primarily as rental property. In the second quarter of 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline by June 30, 2004. In August 2003, we consummated the sale of Galaxy. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, approximately $(245.2) million and $(59.0) million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 also includes a net loss on our disposition of MTS Components and two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million, net of a tax benefit. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. The non cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview In 2003, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe cash flow from operations for the year ending December 31, 2004 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2004. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below. We expect our 2004 cash needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $195.0 million, the repayment of approximately $75.8 million of term loans under our credit facilities and capital lease payments and other notes payable of $5.5 million; capital expenditures of between $50.0 and $65.0 million, principally related to new tower construction and improvements to existing towers; and tower acquisitions of approximately $31.4 million. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and proceeds from sales of non core assets. Due to the risk factors outlined in Business Factors That May Affect Future Results, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our cash needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.4 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness prior to 2002 in order to fund the acquisition of communications sites and services businesses (expenditures for such acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1.4 billion and $812.8 million, respectively), and capital expenditures related to the construction of new communications sites (capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $541.3 million and $568.2 million, respectively). Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003, we continued this trend by reducing our net total indebtedness (the combined decrease in outstanding indebtedness and the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments) by approximately $235.5 million. We also improved our financial flexibility by opportunistically refinancing approximately $1.0 billion of our indebtedness to extend maturity dates. We plan to continue to reduce our overall indebtedness in 2004 and beyond with cash flow from operations, and may opportunistically further reduce indebtedness and interest expense through future capital market or strategic transactions. Uses of Cash Tower Construction, Improvement and Acquisition. Historically, we have used available cash and proceeds from non core asset sales, including cash obtained from our credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities, to fund the construction, improvement and acquisition of tower assets. In 2002, we began to reduce our capital expenditures on new tower development. As a result, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures on new tower development in 2003 from historical levels (for example, our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $61.6 million in 2003 as compared to $180.5 million and $568.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively), and we expect this trend to continue. Accordingly, we expect that our cash needs in 2004 for tower development, improvement and acquisition will be funded out of cash from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions. Construction and Improvements. Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We anticipate that we will build between 120 and 160 new towers through the end of 2004, and expect our 2004 total capital expenditures for construction and improvements to be between approximately $44.0 million and $58.0 million. In addition, we expect to incur approximately $6.0 to $7.0 million in capital expenditures relating to our services division and corporate infrastructure. 33 Table of Contents Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we acquired approximately $95.1 million in tower assets. As of December 31, 2003, we were obligated to make capital expenditures to acquire up to approximately $31.4 million of tower assets, of which approximately $10.3 million had been acquired as of March 5, 2004. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire tower sites, build new tower sites and redevelop or improve existing tower sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. Debt Service. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding debt of approximately $3.4 billion. For the year ending December 31, 2004, we are obligated to make a total of approximately $276.0 million in cash interest and principal payments on outstanding debt (this amount excludes approximately $82.0 million of non cash interest expense relating to the accretion of our ATI 12.25% Notes and warrants and the amortization of deferred financing costs). Our cash debt service obligations as of December 31, 2003 are summarized under Contractual Obligations below. Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Credit facility term loan A (1) $ 73,056 $ 111,459 $ 133,578 $ 71,448 $ 389,541 Credit facility term loan B (1)(2) 2,697 2,697 2,697 258,895 266,986 Credit facility revolver (1) 48,189 48,189 9 3/8% senior notes $ 1,000,000 1,000,000 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes (3) $ 808,000 808,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes 400,000 400,000 5.0% convertible notes (4)(5) 349,413 349,413 6.25% convertible notes (4)(5) 212,742 212,742 3.25% convertible notes 210,000 210,000 2.25% convertible notes 44 44 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 75,797 114,156 349,017 727,945 808,000 1,610,000 3,684,915 Cash interest expense (1)(2)(3)(5) 195,000 184,000 172,000 136,000 130,000 103,000 920,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,548 4,635 19,233 3,355 3,215 208,645 244,631 Operating lease payments 87,905 75,104 62,075 52,234 42,591 289,857 609,766 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 31,400 31,400 Other long term liabilities (6) 1,069 322 329 337 345 3,551 5,953 Total $ 396,719 $ 378,217 $ 602,654 $ 919,871 $ 984,151 $ 2,215,053 $ 5,496,665 A description of our contractual debt obligations is included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, as well as in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. (1) Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option, either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2003 for the credit facilities was 4.25%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate, before the margin as defined in our credit facility agreements, is 1.5% through December 31, 2007. (2) In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. 34 Table of Contents (3) The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum, with principal due at maturity of $808.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding debt under the 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes was $424.2 million accreted value, net of the allocated fair value of $44.2 million relating to warrants issued in conjunction with these notes. (4) The holders of our 6.25% and 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity dates in 2009 and 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligations with respect to the right of the holders to put the 6.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes on October 22, 2006 and February 20, 2007, respectively, have been classified as cash obligations in those respective periods. (5) In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our 5.0% convertible notes. (6) Liabilities that are not payable in cash, primarily our unearned revenue and deferred rent liability, are not included. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2003, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash Total Liquidity at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $544.8 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to draw approximately $269.3 million of the revolving loan under our credit facilities. Of the approximately $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $170.0 million is held in restrictive accounts and approximately $49.1 million of this amount must be used to repay existing indebtedness. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, our cash provided by operating activities was $156.4 million, $105.1 million and $26.1 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2004 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. We expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt. Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $269.3 million of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility, the only loan under our credit facilities that is not fully drawn. We have not borrowed any amounts under our credit facilities since April 2002, and we do not anticipate borrowing any amounts under the revolving credit facility during 2004. In February 2004, we made a $21.0 million voluntary prepayment of term loan A under our credit facilities. 35 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Debt and Equity Securities. During 2003, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities as follows: Date Transaction Approximate NetProceeds January 2003 ATI 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2008 $397.0 million August 2003 $210.0 million 3.25% Convertible Notes due 2010 14,260,000 Shares of Class A common stock $202.8 million $120.3 million November 2003 $400.0 million ATI 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 $389.3 million The net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay approximately $961.3 million of existing indebtedness, and approximately $170.0 million remains in restricted cash and investments at December 31, 2003. In addition, during 2003 we issued 8,415,984 shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for an aggregate amount of approximately $53.1 million accreted value ($67.2 million face value) of our 2.25% convertible notes. These exchanges were effected in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the Securities Act of 1933. In February 2004, we raised an additional approximately $221.7 million of net proceeds through an institutional private placement of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012. Approximately $217.1 million of the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes due 2009, and $4.5 million of those proceeds were used to repurchase our 5.0% convertible notes. (See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.) Divestiture Proceeds. During 2003, we continued to execute our strategy of divesting non core assets and reinvesting the proceeds of such divestitures in higher return tower assets. From January 1, 2003 to March 5, 2004, we received net proceeds of approximately $123.9 million from non core asset sales related to the sale of our remaining components business, two office buildings, a Verestar subsidiary, Galaxy, Kline, and non core towers and related assets. Proceeds from these and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to acquire additional tower assets and to service debt. We anticipate receiving approximately $10.0 million of proceeds from additional sales of non core assets during 2004. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations are the demand for antennae space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services, our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. The credit facilities with our borrower subsidiaries contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, use of proceeds from asset sales, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. The credit facilities contain five financial tests with which we must comply: a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 5.75 to 1.00, decreasing to 5.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 5.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 5.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 4.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004, to 4.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005, to 4.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2005 and to 4.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005 and thereafter; 36 Table of Contents a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00, decreasing to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 3.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 3.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004 and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005 and thereafter; a pro forma debt service test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Pro Forma Debt Service). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00; an interest coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00, increasing to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004; and a fixed charge coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges ). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent company, to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. The credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. In addition to the credit facilities, the indentures governing the terms of the ATI 12.25% Notes and the ATI 7.25% Notes contain certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indentures restrict ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 9 3/8% senior notes and our 7.50% senior notes (issued in February 2004) also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities (which for these purposes includes indebtedness under the credit facilities of our borrower subsidiaries, the ATI 12.25% Notes, the ATI 7.25% Notes and a portion of our 3.25% convertible notes) even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under our credit facilities or any of our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the various agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. However, due to the risk factors outlined above in Business Factors That May Affect Future Results, there can be no assurance that our financial performance will not deteriorate to a point that would result in a default. As outlined above, as of December 31, 2003, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $276.0 million, $303.0 million, $540.0 million (which does not reflect the repurchase of our 6.25% convertible notes in February 2004), 37 Table of Contents $867.0 million, $941.0 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and senior subordinated notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above under Business Factors That May Affect Future Results. In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. We expect that we will need to refinance a substantial portion or our debt on or prior to its scheduled maturity in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In December 2003, we filed a universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and or equity securities, including the offering of Class A common stock pursuant to a direct stock purchase plan with respect to which our Board of Directors currently has approved a $150.0 million offering. This registration statement is not yet effective. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, impairment of assets, allowances for accounts receivable, investment impairment charges and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K, beginning on page F 7. Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2003, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $156.7 million primarily related to our net state deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 38 Table of Contents related to a tax planning strategy related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with such strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims related to certain federal net operating losses, filed during 2003 as part of a tax planning strategy implemented in 2002. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.0 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non core assets held for sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. These tests compared the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to Verestar was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations 39 Table of Contents for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and Verestar and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment. In December 2003 and 2002, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of the rental and management reporting unit (incorporating an independent third party appraisal) that contains goodwill and, in both cases, determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2002 annual impairment testing also included the remaining goodwill of Kline (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and, based on available market information, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline, reclassified its net assets to assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge (inclusive of Klines remaining $10.3 million of goodwill) that reduced Klines net assets to the estimated fair value expected upon disposal. We will perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1st of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Allowances for Accounts Receivable. We maintain allowances for accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totals approximately $17.4 million as of December 31, 2003. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for accounts receivable, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, changes in our customers payment terms and the age of the receivables. If the basis for our estimates and financial condition of our customers were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required. Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion methodology. Under the percentage of completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage of completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. 40 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), and its revision, FIN 46 R, respectively. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R addresses the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R require the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIEs activities, entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns, or both. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R are applicable for financial statements of public entities that have interests in VIEs or potential VIEs referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, of which we had none. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have applied the provisions of FIN 46 and the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We continue to evaluate our investments to determine which, if any, will be impacted by the adoption of FIN 46 R. The adoption of FIN 46 R is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indenture of Our 9 3/8% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our 9 3/8% Notes. This information presents certain of our financial data on a consolidated basis and on a restricted group basis, as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes. All of our subsidiaries are part of the restricted group, except our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar. In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar by sale by December 31, 2003. In December 2003, Verestar filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws and ceased to be included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the filing date forward. Accordingly, the results of operations related to Verestar have been included in loss from discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations through the date of the bankruptcy filing in December 2003.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps, swaps, and collars pursuant to our policies. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we prepaid $757.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities and made scheduled principal payments under the term loans of $47.5 million. In addition, we issued $420.0 million of ATI 12.25% Notes with a principal at maturity of $808.0 million, $210.0 million of 3.25% Notes and $400.0 million of ATI 7.25% Notes. We also had two swaps and two collars expire with aggregate notional amounts totaling $400.0 million and $232.5 million, respectively. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, swaps and collars, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2003 for the credit facilities was 4.25%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 3.85%. The 2.25% and 6.25% Notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% Notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% Notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The ATI 12.25% Notes bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount and the accretion of the warrants) at 14.7% per annum, payable upon maturity. The 9 3/8% Notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 3.25% Notes bear interest at 3.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The ATI 7.25% Notes bear interest at 7.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.9% to 12.0%, payable monthly. In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B under our credit facilities, with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $221.7 million and were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% Notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our outstanding 5.0% Notes. As of December 31, 2002 variable rate debt consists of our credit facilities ($1.51 billion) and fixed rate debt consists of the 2.25% Notes ($210.9 million), the 6.25% Notes ($212.7 million), the 5.0% Notes ($450.0 million), the 9 3/8% Notes ($1.0 billion) and other debt of $64.9 million. Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2002 for the credit facilities was 4.48%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 4.41%. The 2.25% and 6.25% Notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% Notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% Notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% Notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.1% to 12.0%, payable monthly. (b) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contract notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (c) Includes notional amounts of $125,000, $250,000 and $125,000 that will expire in May, June and July 2004, respectively. (d) Includes notional amounts of $215,000 and $185,000 that expired in February and November 2003, respectively. (e) Includes notional amounts of $185,000 and $47,500 that expired in May and June 2003, respectively. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments in short term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. 44 Table of Contents Our foreign operations include rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. The remeasurement loss (gain) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 approximated $1,142,000 $3,713,000 and $(207,000), respectively.
