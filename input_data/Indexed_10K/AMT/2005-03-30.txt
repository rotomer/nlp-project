ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates on page 40. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, corporate general, administrative and development expense, and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods presented in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 96.9% and 98.0% of our total revenues and approximately 99.3% and 99.2% of our segment operating profit for the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our strategic focus on our rental and management segment, the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, a significant majority of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2004 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses are recognized on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2004 was attributable to incremental revenue generated from leasing additional space on our existing towers. During 2004, incremental revenue attributable to towers that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. Our ability to lease additional space on our towers is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing towers. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing towers will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2005. 22 Table of Contents We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new towers. In 2004 and 2003, we constructed or acquired 275 and 618 towers, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these towers following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year over year comparisons. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled in exchange for payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse impact on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, maintenance, taxes and utilities. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services such as sales and property management functions and are included in our rental and management and network development services segment operating expenses. These expenses exclude corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, which are included in corporate general, administrative and development expense. As a result of organizational initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to manage our operations more efficiently, our segment operating expenses have decreased over these periods and were stable in 2004. Because our operating expenses generally do not increase significantly when we add additional customers on a tower site, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. Our tower network consists of approximately 15,000 sites in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 12,500 tower sites were located in the United States, 1,900 tower sites were located in Mexico and approximately 450 tower sites were located in Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 16.6% of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations. We anticipate that the revenues from our international operations as a percentage of our consolidated revenues may grow in the future. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2004 2003 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 684,422 $ 619,697 $ 64,725 10 % Network development services 22,238 12,796 9,442 74 Total revenues 706,660 632,493 74,167 12 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 237,312 236,680 632 1 Network development services 18,801 9,493 9,308 98 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 329,449 330,414 (965 ) (1 ) Corporate general, administrative and development expense 27,468 26,867 601 2 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense 23,876 31,656 (7,780 ) (25 ) Total operating expenses 636,906 635,110 1,796 1 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,497 and $1,496 14,316 14,222 94 1 Interest income 4,844 5,255 (411 ) (8 ) Interest expense (262,237 ) (279,783 ) (17,546 ) (6 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (138,016 ) (46,197 ) 91,819 199 Other expense (2,798 ) (8,598 ) (5,800 ) (67 ) Income tax benefit 80,176 77,796 2,380 3 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,366 ) (3,703 ) (1,337 ) (36 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,915 ) (21,221 ) (18,306 ) (86 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (8,345 ) (60,475 ) (52,130 ) (86 ) Net loss $ (247,587 ) $ (325,321 ) $ (77,734 ) (24 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $706.7 million, an increase of $74.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $64.7 million and an increase in network development services revenue of $9.4 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $684.4 million, an increase of $64.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2003. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2003. In 2004, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. We believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. 24 Table of Contents Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $22.2 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in revenues during 2004 resulted primarily from a long term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. In October 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our tower construction services unit. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reported our tower construction services unit as a discontinued operation. The sale closed in November 2004. After the sale, our network development services segment is focused on providing complementary non construction services to the rental and management segment, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $636.9 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The principal components of the increase were attributable to expense increases in our network development services segment of $9.3 million, our rental and management segment of $0.6 million and corporate general, administrative and development expense of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense of $7.8 million and in depreciation, amortization and accretion of $1.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $237.3 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from our acquisition/construction of approximately 900 towers partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the 400 towers that were sold or disposed of subsequent to January 2003, coupled with an overall decrease in rental and management segment expenses. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $461.4 million, an increase of $64.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and or constructed towers. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $18.8 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in expenses during 2004 resulted primarily from expenses associated with a long term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $7.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of the decrease resulted from decreased impairments and losses on sales of long lived tower and other non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $262.2 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from the retirement of a portion of our 9 3/8% senior notes and 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes partially offset by additional interest incurred related to the issuance of our 3.00% convertible notes, 7.125% senior notes and 7.5% senior notes in 2004. 25 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2004, we retired all or a portion of our 6.25% convertible notes, 9 3/8% senior notes and ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes. As a result, we incurred a charge of approximately $103.2 million, which represented the cash paid in excess of the carrying value of the debt at the time of retirement. In addition, we also incurred a charge of $34.8 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees related to the retirements discussed above, the retirement of a portion of our 5.0% convertible notes and the refinancing of our credit facility. The total of these charges, $138.0 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $80.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of non deductible losses on retirements of our debt in 2003. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non deductible losses on retirement of our debt. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2004, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $173.1 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards, certain foreign items and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with our tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims as discussed below and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net 26 Table of Contents operating losses generated in 2002. In total, we carried back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2024. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded on one of our equity investments of $19.3 million in 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $8.3 million, as compared to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In October 2004, we committed to a plan to sell our tower construction services unit, which was subsequently sold in November 2004. In addition, we sold Kline in March 2004. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. During 2003, we disposed of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy and Flash, two office buildings and Verestars MTN subsidiary. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, our tower construction services unit, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Klines net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. 27 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2003 2002 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 619,697 $ 544,906 $ 74,791 14 % Network development services 12,796 32,888 (20,092 ) (61 ) Total revenues 632,493 577,794 54,699 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 236,680 242,801 (6,121 ) (3 ) Network development services 9,493 29,214 (19,721 ) (68 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 330,414 327,665 2,749 1 Corporate general, administrative and development expense 26,867 30,229 (3,362 ) (11 ) Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense 31,656 101,372 (69,716 ) (69 ) Total operating expenses 635,110 731,281 (96,171 ) (13 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,496 and $1,494 14,222 13,938 284 2 Interest income 5,255 3,496 1,759 50 Interest expense (279,783 ) (254,345 ) 25,438 10 Loss on retirement of long term obligations (46,197 ) (8,869 ) 37,328 421 Other expense (8,598 ) (7,004 ) 1,594 23 Income tax benefit 77,796 81,141 (3,345 ) (4 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (3,703 ) (2,118 ) 1,585 75 Loss on equity method investments (21,221 ) (18,555 ) 2,666 14 Loss from discontinued operations, net (60,475 ) (255,119 ) (194,644 ) (76 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (562,618 ) (562,618 ) (100 ) Net loss $ (325,321 ) $ (1,163,540 ) $ (838,219 ) (72 )% 28 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $632.5 million, an increase of $54.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $74.8 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $20.1 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $619.7 million, an increase of $74.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2002 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 1,200 towers acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2002. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $20.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decline in revenues during 2003 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to the reduced demand for non construction services in the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $635.1 million, a decrease of $96.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense of $69.7 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in expenses within our network development services segment of $19.7 million, our rental and management segment of $6.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $3.4 million. Such decreases were offset by an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion of approximately $2.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $236.7 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in certain rental and management segment overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in tower expenses related to the 1,200 towers we have acquired/constructed since January 1, 2002 due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2003. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $397.2 million, an increase of $81.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and or constructed towers, coupled with a net reduction in tower expenses, as discussed above. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $9.5 million, a decrease of $19.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, partially offset by decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above. 29 Table of Contents Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $26.9 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold approximately 300 non core towers and certain other non core assets and recorded impairment charges to write down certain other non core towers and assets. As a result, we recorded impairment charges and net loss on sale of long lived assets of approximately $19.1 million. We also wrote off approximately $9.2 million of construction in progress costs, primarily associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs (primarily associated with the reorganization of certain functions in our rental and management segment) and facility closing costs aggregating $3.4 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non core towers and recorded impairment charges to write down certain other non core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote off approximately $40.2 million of construction in progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Additionally, in the latter stages of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of these initiatives, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs, aggregating $10.6 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $5.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on restricted cash and investments, resulting principally from our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering in January 2003 and, to a lesser extent, our August 2003 equity offering. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $279.8 million, an increase of $25.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the following: interest expense on the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes, issued in January 2003; our 3.25% convertible notes, issued in August 2003; and the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes, issued in November 2003. The increase was partially offset by a net decrease in interest expense on our credit facilities as a result of repayments made during 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our 2.25% and 5.0% convertible notes as a result of repurchases made during 2003 (as discussed below). Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. 30 Table of Contents We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired in October 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In February 2002, we repaid $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facility. As a result of such repayment, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge of approximately $1.7 million related to the write off of related deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi draw term loan C component of our credit facility and recorded a non cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write off of related deferred financing fees. The total of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $8.6 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. This increase was primarily offset by decreased foreign currency transaction losses. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $77.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate was 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of a $27.5 million valuation allowance that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. This strategy resulted in the filing of tax refund claims with the IRS in 2003. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs incurred in connection with implementing this strategy. This increase was offset in part by an increase in the valuation allowance in 2003 for capital losses and non deductible losses on retirements of our debt. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non deductible losses on retirement of our debt. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our tax planning strategy discussed above. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2003, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $162.8 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with the tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be 31 Table of Contents successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.1 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described below, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $21.2 million, an increase of $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is related to an increase in impairment charges on our equity investments of $9.8 million, offset by a decrease in losses on our equity investments of $7.1 million. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $60.5 million, as compared to $255.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During 2003, we consummated the sale of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy and Flash, two office buildings and Verestars MTN subsidiary. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, our tower construction services unit, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Klines net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. During 2002, we consummated the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary MTS Components and an office building. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $241.6 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, 2002 also includes the results of operations of Galaxy, Flash, two other office buildings, our tower construction services unit, Kline and Verestar. In addition to the above, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a net loss on our disposition of MTS Components of approximately $16.0 million, a net gain on our sale of the office building of $5.7 million and an impairment charge of $3.2 million related to another office building sold in 2003. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. The non cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services 32 Table of Contents segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2004, we took several actions to increase our financial flexibility, extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness and reduce interest expense. In May 2004, we entered into a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. In 2004, we also completed four note offerings through institutional private placements in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. We used the net proceeds of the borrowings under the credit facility and the note offerings, as well as cash on hand, to refinance or repurchase approximately $2.0 billion of our outstanding debt. For information about our financing activities, see Financing Activities below. As of December 31, 2004, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.3 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of communications sites and services businesses (expenditures for such acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1.4 billion and $812.8 million, respectively), and capital expenditures related to the construction of new communications sites (capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $541.3 million and $568.2 million, respectively). Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003 and 2004, we continued this effort by reducing our net total indebtedness and improving our financial flexibility by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates. We plan to continue to reduce our overall indebtedness in 2005 with cash flow from operations, and may opportunistically further reduce indebtedness and interest expense through future capital market or strategic transactions. In 2004, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated from operations for the year ending December 31, 2005 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2005. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below. We expect our 2005 cash needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $173.0 million, the redemption of approximately $133.0 million of 9 3/8% senior notes, the repayment of approximately $4.0 million of term loans under the credit facility and capital lease payments and other notes payable of approximately $4.5 million; and capital expenditures of between $55.0 and $65.0 million, principally related to new tower construction and improvements to existing towers. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Due to the risk factors outlined in Business Factors That May Affect Future Results, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our cash needs without additional borrowings under our credit facility. Uses of Cash Tower Acquisitions, Construction and Improvements. Historically, we have used available cash, including cash obtained from our credit facility, proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities and proceeds from non core asset sales, to fund the acquisition, construction and improvement of tower assets. In 2002, we began to reduce our capital expenditures on new tower development. As a result, our capital expenditures in 2003 and 2004 were $61.6 million and $42.2 million, respectively, significantly below historical levels. Construction and Improvements. Payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $42.2 million, including capital expenditures 33 Table of Contents incurred in connection with the construction of 61 towers. We anticipate that we will build between 125 and 150 new towers through the end of 2005, and expect our 2005 total capital expenditures for construction, improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately $55.0 million and $65.0 million. Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired a total of 214 towers for approximately $33.4 million, including 25 towers in Brazil and 18 towers in Mexico from NII Holdings for an aggregate of $7.6 million, 97 towers in Mexico from Iusacell Celular for an aggregate of $20.8 million, and 74 towers in the United States from various sellers for an aggregate of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2004, we were obligated to acquire up to an additional $2.5 million of tower assets. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire tower sites, build new tower sites and redevelop or improve existing tower sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness and reduce interest expense, we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our outstanding debt securities. During 2004, we refinanced or repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of our outstanding debt. For more information about our financing activities, see Financing Activities below. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facility and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Credit facility term loan A (1)(2) $ 22,500 $ 52,500 $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ 105,000 $ 300,000 Credit facility term loan B (1)(2) $ 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 378,000 398,000 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes (3) 498,251 498,251 7.25% senior subordinated notes 400,000 400,000 9 3/8% senior notes (4) 133,000 141,884 274,884 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes (5) 275,688 275,688 3.25% convertible notes 210,000 210,000 3.00% convertible notes 345,000 345,000 2.25% convertible notes 46 46 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 137,046 26,500 332,188 562,251 205,884 2,163,000 3,426,869 Cash interest expense (1)(2)(3) 173,000 171,000 158,000 153,000 125,000 275,000 1,055,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 4,484 19,691 3,732 3,290 3,250 208,587 243,034 Operating lease payments (6) 106,116 106,319 106,095 106,191 106,214 1,570,111 2,101,046 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 2,500 2,500 Other long term liabilities (7) 210 996 223 223 223 24,909 26,784 Total $ 423,356 $ 324,506 $ 600,238 $ 824,955 $ 440,571 $ 4,241,607 $ 6,855,233 A description of our contractual debt obligations is included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, as well as in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. (1) The maturity date for our term loan A and any outstanding revolving loans will be accelerated to August 15, 2008, and the maturity date for our term loan B will be accelerated to October 31, 2008, if (1) on or prior to August 1, 2008, our 9 3/8% senior notes have not been (a) refinanced with parent company indebtedness having a maturity date of February 28, 2012 or later or with loans under the credit facility, or (b) repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise retired; and (2) our consolidated leverage ratio (total parent company debt to annualized operating cash flow) at June 30, 2008 exceeds 4.50 to 1.00. If this were to occur, the payments due in 2008 for term loan A and term loan B would be $225.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively. 34 Table of Contents (2) Interest under our credit facility is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option, either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2004 for the credit facility was 4.35%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facility, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin as defined in our credit facility agreement, is 2.6% through August 31, 2011. (3) The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes were originally issued as part of an offering of 808,000 units, each unit consisting of one 12.25% senior subordinated discount note having a principal amount of $1,000 at maturity and one warrant to purchase 14.0953 shares of our Class A common stock at $0.01 per share. The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining outstanding debt under the 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes was $325.4 million accreted value ($303.8 million, net of the allocated fair value of the warrants of $21.6 million). (4) On December 6, 2004, we issued a notice for the partial redemption on January 5, 2005 of $133.0 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009. Pursuant to the indenture for the 9 3/8% senior notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. Following this redemption, $141.9 million principal amount of 9 3/8% senior notes remained outstanding. (5) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. (6) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (7) Excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our deferred rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2004, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash Total Liquidity at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $596.3 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $215.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to draw approximately $380.7 million of the revolving loan under our credit facility. Of the approximately $215.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, we used approximately $145.1 million to redeem on January 5, 2005 a portion of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our cash provided by operating activities was $216.7 million, $156.4 million and $105.1 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2005 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt. Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $380.7 million of unused capacity under our revolving loan commitments, the only loan under our credit facility that is not fully drawn. We have not borrowed any amounts under our credit facility since refinancing it in May 2004. Proceeds from the New Credit Facility and Sales of Debt Securities. In May 2004, we refinanced our previous credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. In 2004, we also completed four note offerings in institutional private placements through which we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. See Financing Activities. Divestiture Proceeds. During 2004, we continued to execute our strategy of divesting non core assets and reinvesting the proceeds of such divestitures in higher return tower assets. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $32.0 million related to the sale of Kline, our tower construction services unit, and non core towers and related assets. Proceeds from these and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to acquire additional tower assets and to service debt. 35 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. From time to time, we raise funds through public offerings of our equity securities. In addition, we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we received approximately $40.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares of our Class A common stock and the common stock of ATC Mexico pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans. Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2004, we took several actions to increase our financial flexibility and reduce our interest costs. New Credit Facility. In May 2004, we refinanced our previous credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. At closing, we received $685.5 million of net proceeds from the borrowings under the new facility, after deducting related expenses and fees, approximately $670.0 million of which we used to repay principal and interest under the previous credit facility. We used the remaining net proceeds of $15.5 million for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of other outstanding debt securities. The new credit facility consists of the following: $400.0 million in undrawn revolving loan commitments, against which approximately $19.3 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2004, maturing on February 28, 2011; a $300.0 million term loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on February 28, 2011; and a $398.0 million term loan B, which is fully drawn, maturing on August 31, 2011. The new credit facility extends the previous credit facility maturity dates from 2007 to 2011 for a majority of the borrowings outstanding, subject to earlier maturity upon the occurrence of certain events described below, and allows us to use credit facility borrowings and internally generated funds to repurchase other indebtedness without additional lender approval. The new credit facility is guaranteed by us and is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets. The maturity date for term loan A and any outstanding revolving loans will be accelerated to August 15, 2008, and the maturity date for term loan B will be accelerated to October 31, 2008, if (1) on or prior to August 1, 2008, our 9 3/8% senior notes have not been (a) refinanced with parent company indebtedness having a maturity date of February 28, 2012 or later or with loans under the new credit facility, or (b) repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise retired, and (2) our consolidated leverage ratio (total parent company debt to annualized operating cash flow) at June 30, 2008 is greater than 4.50 to 1.00. If this were to occur, the payments due in 2008 for term loan A and term loan B would be $225.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively. Note Offerings. During 2004, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the sale of debt securities through institutional private placements as follows (in millions): Debt Security Date of Offering PrincipalAmount ApproximateNet Proceeds 7.50% Senior Notes due 2012 February 2004 $ 225.0 $ 221.7 3.00% Convertible Notes due August 15, 2012 August 2004 345.0 335.9 7.125% Senior Notes due 2012 October 2004 300.0 292.8 7.125% Senior Notes due 2012 December 2004 200.0 199.8 Total $ 1,070.0 $ 1,050.2 7.50% Senior Notes Offering. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The 7.50% senior notes mature on May 1, 2012, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. 36 Table of Contents We may redeem the 7.50% senior notes after May 1, 2008. The initial redemption price is 103.750% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after May 1 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2010 and thereafter. The 7.50% senior notes rank equally with our 5.0% convertible notes, our 3.00% convertible notes, our 3.25% convertible notes, our 7.125% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our 7.25% senior subordinated notes. The indenture for the 7.50% senior notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more debt; guarantee indebtedness; issue preferred stock; pay dividends; make certain investments; merge, consolidate or sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. 3.00% Convertible Notes Offering. In August 2004, we sold $345.0 million principal amount of 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 through an institutional private placement. The 3.00% convertible notes mature on August 15, 2012, and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 3.00% convertible notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, subject to their prior redemption or repurchase, into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of approximately $20.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon a fundamental change of control as defined in the notes indenture, the holders of the 3.00% convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the 3.00% convertible notes for a cash purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, upon a fundamental change in control, the holders may elect to convert their notes based on a conversion rate adjustment that entitles the holders to receive additional shares of the Companys Class A common stock upon conversion depending on the terms and timing of the change of control. We may redeem the 3.00% convertible notes on or after August 20, 2009 at an initial redemption price of 101.125% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after August 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2012. The 3.00% convertible notes rank equally with our other convertible notes, our 7.125% senior notes, our 7.50% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes. 7.125% Senior Notes Offerings. In October 2004, we sold $300.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement at a purchase price equal to 100% of face amount. In December 2004, we sold an additional $200.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement at a purchase price equal to 101.25% of face amount. The 7.125% senior notes mature on October 15, 2012, and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2005. We may redeem the 7.125% senior notes on or after October 15, 2008 at an initial redemption price of 103.563% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after October 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2010 and thereafter. The 7.125% senior notes rank equally with our convertible notes, our 7.50% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes. The indenture for the 7.125% senior notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more debt; guarantee indebtedness; issue preferred stock; pay dividends; make certain investments; merge, consolidate or sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. 37 Table of Contents Note Redemptions and Repurchases. During 2004, we repurchased and redeemed approximately $1.5 billion in debt securities as follows (in millions): Debt Security Date PrincipalAmount AggregatePrice Redemptions 6.25% Convertible Notes due 2009 February 2004 $ 212.7 $ 217.2 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 September 2004 337.0 360.8 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 November 2004 276.0 293.2 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 (1) January 2005 133.0 139.8 Repurchases ATI 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2008 (2) 309.7 230.9 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 112.1 118.9 5.0% Convertible Notes due 2010 73.7 73.3 Total $ 1,454.2 $ 1,434.1 (1) On December 6, 2004, we issued a notice for the partial redemption on January 5, 2005 of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009. Pursuant to the indenture for the 9 3/8% senior notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. (2) The repurchased amount of $309.7 million represents the face amount at maturity in 2008. On the date of repurchase, such amount had an accreted value of $179.4 million, net of $14.7 million fair value allocated to warrants. 6.25% Convertible Notes Redemption. In February 2004, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our 7.50% senior notes offering to redeem all of our outstanding $212.7 million principal amount of 6.25% convertible notes. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 102.083% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We redeemed these notes for $217.2 million, plus $4.8 million in accrued interest. 9 3/8% Senior Notes Redemptions. In September 2004, November 2004 and January 2005, we completed the redemption of an aggregate of $746.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009, as follows. On September 20, 2004, we redeemed $337.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using the net proceeds from our 3.00% convertible notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 107.07% of the principal amount, for $360.8 million, plus $4.3 million in accrued interest. On November 4, 2004, we redeemed $276.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using the net proceeds from our October 2004 7.125% senior notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 106.23% of the principal amount, for $293.2 million, plus $6.7 million in accrued interest. On January 5, 2005, we redeemed $133.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using a portion of net proceeds from our December 2004 7.125% senior notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 105.11% of the principal amount, for $139.8 million, plus $5.3 million in accrued interest. Other Debt Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2004, in addition to the redemptions discussed above, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, primarily using cash on hand (i) an aggregate of $309.7 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes ($179.4 million accreted value, net of $14.7 million fair value allocated to warrants) for approximately $230.9 million in cash; (ii) $112.1 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes for $118.9 million in cash; and (iii) $73.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes for approximately $73.3 million in cash. From December 31, 2004 to March 25, 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $37.0 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes ($22.6 million accreted value, net of $1.6 million fair value allocated to warrants) for approximately $27.9 million in cash. 38 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2004 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under New Credit Facility. The new credit facility with our borrower subsidiaries contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, use of proceeds from asset sales, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. The credit facility contains four financial tests with which we must comply: a total borrower leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). We are required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00, decreasing to 5.25 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005, to 5.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2006, to 4.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2006, to 4.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2006, and to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2007 and thereafter; a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). We are required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00, decreasing to 3.75 to 1.00 at January 1, 2006, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2006, and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2007 and thereafter; an interest coverage ratio (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). We are required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00; and a fixed charge coverage ratio (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges). We are required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving loan, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent company, to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. The credit facility also limits our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. In addition to the credit facility, the indentures governing the terms of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes contain certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facility, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indentures restrict ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 9 3/8% senior notes, 7.50% senior notes and 7.125% senior notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any 39 Table of Contents failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facility even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facility. If a default occurred under our credit facility or any of our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facility agreement and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As outlined above, as of December 31, 2004, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $314.5 million, $217.2 million, $493.9 million, $718.5 million, $334.1 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facility and senior subordinated notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above under Factors That May Affect Future Results. In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. We expect that we will need to refinance a substantial portion of our debt on or prior to its scheduled maturity in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and or equity securities, including the offering of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to a direct stock purchase plan, with respect to which our Board of Directors has approved offerings of up to $150.0 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, impairment of assets, allowances for accounts receivable, investment impairment charges and revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method. Management bases its 40 Table of Contents estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K, beginning on page F 7. Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2004, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $173.1 million primarily related to our net state deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 related to a tax planning strategy related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with such strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims related to certain federal net operating losses, filed during 2003 as part of a tax planning strategy implemented in 2002. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2024. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non core assets held for sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. 41 Table of Contents We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. These tests compared the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to our Verestar subsidiary was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in our network development services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for our rental and management segment and Verestar and future discounted cash flows and market information in our network development services segment. In December 2004, 2003 and 2002, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment (incorporating an independent third party appraisal in 2003 and 2002) and, in all cases, determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2002 annual impairment testing also included the remaining goodwill of our Kline subsidiary (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and, based on available market information, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline, reclassified its net assets to assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge (inclusive of Klines remaining $10.3 million of goodwill) that reduced Klines net assets to the estimated fair value expected upon disposal. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1st of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Allowances for Accounts Receivable. We maintain allowances for accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect amounts billed to our customers. Such amounts approximated $14.0 million as of December 31, 2004. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for accounts receivable, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, changes in our customers payment terms, reasons why customer accounts remain unpaid and the age of the receivables. If the basis for our estimates and financial condition of our customers were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required. Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting securities of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting securities of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. As of December 31, 2004, our only investment was an equity investment with a carrying value of approximately $10.2 million. 42 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion methodology. Under the percentage of completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage of completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. The statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We are in the process of evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by SFAS 123R; the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we repaid or refinanced approximately $2.0 billion of principal on our outstanding debt, including the refinancing of our previous credit facility of $665.8 million with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility; $40.9 million of principal payments under our credit facility; the redemption of $212.7 million principal amount of our 6.25% convertible notes; the partial redemption and repurchase of $725.1 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes; and the repurchase of $383.4 million face amount of our other debt securities. In February 2004 and August 2004, we issued $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due May 1, 2012 and $345.0 million principal amount of 3.0% convertible notes due August 15, 2012. We also issued $500.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due October 15, 2012 in October and December 2004. In June 2004 and July 2004, we entered into two cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, and during the year ended December 31, 2003, we had four caps expire with aggregate notional amounts totaling $500.0 million. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B under our credit facilities, with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $221.7 million and were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% Notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our outstanding 5.0% Notes. (b) Includes notional amounts of $250,000 and $100,000 that will expire in June and July 2006, respectively. (c) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contract notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (d) Includes notional amounts of $125,000, $250,000 and $125,000 that expired in May, June and July 2004, respectively. Our foreign operations include rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. The remeasurement losses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 approximated $146,000, $1,142,000, and $3,713,000, respectively. 45 Table of Contents We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt, comprised of $698.0 million under our credit facility as of December 31, 2004. A 10% increase, or approximately 44 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our net loss of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, changes in interest rates can also cause our cash flows to fluctuate relative to interest payments on variable rate debt. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 44 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
