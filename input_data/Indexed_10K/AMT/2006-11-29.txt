ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have restated our consolidated financial statements, as further discussed in the Explanatory Note in the forepart of this Form 10 K/A and in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K/A, and the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations reflect this restatement. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates on page 52. Stock Option Review and Restatement of Financial Statements As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the restatement reflected in this Form 10 K/A corrects certain errors related to (i) stock based compensation not previously recorded for certain stock option grants, including the related payroll and income tax effects, (ii) additional charges for stock based compensation expense related to the modification and repricing of certain stock option grants, primarily associated with options awarded to two former executive officers, and (iii) changes to income taxes related to the tax effects of foreign currency fluctuations on an intercompany loan with a foreign subsidiary. Our decision to restate our previously issued financial statements was based, in part, on an independent review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting. On May 19, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic auditors. The special committee determined that, for certain stock option grants, the legal grant dates when all necessary corporate action had been taken differ from the dates previously recorded by us for financial accounting and tax purposes. The special committee reviewed substantially all stock options granted during the period from our becoming a public company in June 1998 through May 2006, including all option grants to our officers and directors, all option grants to individuals in excess of 100,000 shares and all option grants to employees in connection with our annual all employee option grant program. On November 6, 2006, the special committee reported to our Board of Directors regarding its findings. The following is a summary of the special committees key findings: The grant dates reported by the Company for accounting and financial reporting purposes for most stock option grants during the period from the Companys becoming a public company in June 1998 and into 2005 were incorrect because they did not reflect the dates on which the grants were legally effective. From June 1998 through 2004, for certain large annual grants and many other individual grants, certain members of management followed a practice of choosing past dates as grant dates so as to use a lower exercise price, with the period of lookback appearing to range from a couple of days to eight weeks. The option grants involving lookbacks were inconsistent with the Companys disclosures that option grants were made at fair market value, were not accounted for properly and, to the extent they involved incentive stock options, violated the requirement under the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan that they be at fair market value. Stock options were granted by management pursuant to authority they believed had been delegated by the Compensation Committee, but that delegation was not adequately documented, and therefore the necessary legal approval of some grants did not occur until they were subsequently approved by the Compensation Committee. 34 Table of Contents The process by which members of the Compensation Committee formally approved option grants involved the signing of unanimous written consents that included schedules of option grants approved by management for the preceding quarter. The Company typically used the date set forth in the schedules attached to the written consents as the option grant date. However, all necessary corporate action had not been taken until the written consents were actually signed by all committee members, which typically did not happen until later, sometimes resulting in a delay of many months between the date recorded by the Company as the option grant date and the legal grant date. The Companys flawed option practices began with past management, whose members frequently looked back to select option grant dates. With the likely exception of one past member of management, the evidence does not indicate that management at the time in question was aware that, in looking back to choose a past grant date with a more favorable closing price, the Company was failing to take necessary accounting charges or acting contrary to the Companys disclosures. However, certain members of past management who initiated and were involved with the option practices should have been aware of the accounting or legal issues or sought legal and accounting advice as to the practice. Current managements efforts to improve and formalize procedures for option grants since early 2004 have had the effect of eliminating the practice of lookbacks. In addition, the evidence does not indicate intentional misconduct by any member of current management. Some members of current management, however, were made aware of the use of lookbacks for certain option grants, and certain of them should have been aware of the accounting or legal issues or inquired further. One or more outside lawyers for the Company were, on multiple occasions, told of the lookback practice and did not advise the Company of the accounting and legal problems with that practice. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee failed to adopt adequate procedures to ensure that Compensation Committee members understood the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan and that it was properly administered. From 1998 through 2005, the Companys processes, procedures and controls were inadequate, although management steadily improved the processes beginning in 2001. In 2006, the Compensation Committee revised its procedures for approving stock option grants in an effort to ensure compliance in the future. The Company also had inadequate controls relating to, and failed to account properly for, certain modifications of outstanding stock option rights. The special committee will recommend to our Board of Directors a remediation plan to address the issues raised by its findings. While the special committee has not yet finalized its remediation recommendations, they are expected to include recommendations regarding improved stock option administration procedures and controls (with respect to which, as noted above, the committee found that management had already made certain changes), training and monitoring of compliance with those procedures, corporate risk assessment and evaluation of the internal compliance environment, and an evaluation by our chief executive officer of the Companys resources, especially with respect to compliance and administration. The special committee has concluded that it will not recommend any terminations or that any changes in positions of current executive management be made as a result of its findings. It is expected to recommend, however, that our chief executive officer review and evaluate the organization of the Companys senior management consistent with the findings of the special committee, and report back to the Board on any changes that should be made to the Companys organizational plan or to the duties of members of current management. In connection with the review by the special committee, we undertook a review of option grant dates recorded for financial accounting and tax purposes. Based on our facts and circumstances, we concluded that we should use the legal grant date, as determined by the special committee, as the accounting measurement date for such awards. Accordingly, based on this conclusion, we applied new measurement dates to the affected stock option grants and, as a result, determined that charges for stock based compensation expense and related payroll and income tax effects were required in instances where the quoted market price of the underlying stock at the 35 Table of Contents new measurement date exceeded the employees exercise price, in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In addition, the restatement reflects charges for penalties and interest related to the failure to properly withhold employee taxes upon exercise of certain stock options that were originally classified as incentive stock options, but were recharacterized as non qualified stock options as a result of applying a new measurement date to such options. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98.4% and 96.9% of our total revenues and approximately 99.5% and 99.3% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During 2005, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2005 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in building systems in the United States. The merger was approved by our and SpectraSites stockholders on August 3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in our consolidated results of operations since that date. During the period August 3, 2005 through December 31, 2005, SpectraSite generated total revenues of $171.2 million and operating profit of $106.8 million. Our revenue growth in 2005 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2005, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, was approximately $63.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services 36 Table of Contents and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites, including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2006. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. In addition to the approximately 7,800 towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we constructed or acquired 289 and 275 sites in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year over year comparisons. During 2005, revenue attributable to these 564 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, was approximately $10.8 million. Our continuing operations are reported in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and operating profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and operating profit (loss) for the rental and management segment include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2005 2004 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 929,762 $ 684,422 $ 245,340 36 % Network development services 15,024 22,238 (7,214 ) (32 ) Total revenues 944,786 706,660 238,126 34 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 247,781 195,242 52,539 27 Network development services 8,346 16,220 (7,874 ) (49 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 411,254 329,449 81,805 25 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $6,597 and $9,874 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 108,059 83,094 24,965 30 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 and $876 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 34,232 23,876 10,356 43 Total operating expenses 809,672 647,881 161,791 25 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,492 and $1,497 14,232 14,316 (84 ) (1 ) Interest income 4,402 4,844 (442 ) (9 ) Interest expense (222,419 ) (262,237 ) (39,818 ) (15 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (67,110 ) (138,016 ) (70,906 ) (51 ) Other income (expense) 227 (2,798 ) (3,025 ) (108 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (5,714 ) 83,338 (89,052 ) (107 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (575 ) (2,366 ) (1,791 ) (76 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,078 ) (2,915 ) (837 ) (29 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (1,913 ) (8,409 ) (6,496 ) (77 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) 35,525 Net loss $ (181,359 ) $ (255,464 ) $ (74,105 ) (29 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $944.8 million, an increase of $238.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $74.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $7.2 million. 38 Table of Contents Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $929.8 million, an increase of $245.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $63.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $10.8 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. We believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million from year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services, primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services, as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, and offer only limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $809.7 million, an increase of $161.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $81.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $52.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $25.0 million, and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $10.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of $7.9 million. We expect our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 to include approximately $38.0 million to $40.0 million related to the January 1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123R regarding stock based compensation expense, as described below in Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $247.8 million, an increase of $52.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $53.1 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Excluding the impact of expenses incurred by SpectraSite, rental and management expense did not change materially as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $696.2 million, an increase of $192.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $118.1 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment operating profit generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of January 1, 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. 39 Table of Contents Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $7.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $411.3 million, an increase of $81.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to approximately $78.0 million of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger and approximately $3.8 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other long lived assets. We expect our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 to increase by approximately $131.0 million, including approximately $110.0 million related to the inclusion of a full year of expense related to acquired SpectraSite long lived assets and approximately $21.0 million related to the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations described below. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $108.1 million, an increase of $25.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $18.6 million of the increase was attributable to general and administrative expense incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses, including amounts paid in connection with the closing of the SpectraSite merger, offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in stock based compensation expense, which aggregated $6.6 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As a result of the January 1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we expect our total selling, general, administrative and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 to include approximately $38.0 million to $40.0 million of non cash stock based compensation expense. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $34.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to merger related expense of $9.0 million incurred in connection with the SpectraSite merger, including employee separation costs of $3.1 million, amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of $2.4 million and other employee stock option charges of $3.5 million. Restructuring expense and stock based compensation expense also increased by $4.6 million related to modified option awards, which was partially offset by a decline of $3.2 million in impairments and net losses on sales of long lived non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $222.4 million, a decrease of $39.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, repurchases of our ATI 12.25% Notes, conversions of our 3.25% Notes and the refinancing of the American Tower credit facility at lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 7.50% Notes, 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) Notes and 7.125% Notes issued in February, August and September of 2004, respectively, and approximately $15.2 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million 40 Table of Contents principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities below. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes, redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, ATI 12.25% Notes and 5.0% convertible notes, and refinanced of our credit facility. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $138.0 million charge related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million from other expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $2.9 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.7 million, as compared to an $83.3 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing a decrease of $89.1 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund. Minority Interest in Net Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a result of the Companys purchase during 2004 of the remaining 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico that it did not own. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.9 million, as compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. We also expect to incur additional costs in connection with these proceedings. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.8 million 41 Table of Contents related to the results of operations through the date of sale of our tower construction services unit and Kline, as well as a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No. 47). As a result, we recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. The acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other long term obligations of $114.0 million.

Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $684.4 million, an increase of $64.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2003. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2003. In 2004, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. We believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $22.2 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in revenues during 2004 resulted primarily from a long term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. In October 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our tower construction services unit. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reported our tower construction services unit as a discontinued operation. The sale closed in November 2004. After the sale, our network development services segment is focused on providing complementary non construction services to the rental and management segment, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $647.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The principal components of the increase were attributable to expense increases in our network development services segment of $8.8 million, our rental and management segment of $2.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $0.4 million, in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense of $7.8 million and in depreciation, amortization and accretion of $1.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $195.2 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from our acquisition/construction of approximately 900 towers partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the 400 towers that were sold or disposed of subsequent to January 2003, coupled with an overall decrease in rental and management segment expenses. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $503.5 million, an increase of $62.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and or constructed towers. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $16.2 million, an increase of $8.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in expenses during 2004 resulted primarily from expenses associated with a long term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. 43 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $83.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily related to a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets and restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $7.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of the decrease resulted from decreased impairments and losses on sales of long lived tower and other non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $262.2 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from the retirement of a portion of our 9 3/8% Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes partially offset by additional interest incurred related to the issuance of our 3.00% Notes, 7.125% Notes and 7.50% Notes in 2004. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2004, we retired all or a portion of our 6.25% convertible notes, 9 3/8% Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes. As a result, we incurred a charge of approximately $103.2 million, which represented the cash paid in excess of the carrying value of the debt at the time of retirement. In addition, we also incurred a charge of $34.8 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees related to the retirements discussed above, the retirement of a portion of our 5.0% convertible notes and the refinancing of our credit facility. The total of these charges, $138.0 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% Notes offering. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $83.3 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of non deductible losses on retirements of our debt in 2003. 44 Table of Contents The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non deductible losses on retirement of our debt. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to carrying back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we anticipated receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims and estimated recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded on one of our equity investments of $19.3 million in 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $8.4 million, as compared to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In October 2004, we committed to a plan to sell our tower construction services unit, which was subsequently sold in November 2004. In addition, we sold Kline in March 2004. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.8 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. During 2003, we disposed of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy Engineering and Flash Technologies, two office buildings and two subsidiaries of Verestar. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $13.2 million related to the results of these operations, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Klines net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2005, we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive, lower cost capital, which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Significant transactions included the following: In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. During 2005, consistent with our strategy of replacing our higher cost, more restrictive debt with less expensive, less restrictive capital, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. In addition, in December 2005, we issued a 45 Table of Contents notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February 1, 2006. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. In November 2005, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.6 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of tower sites and services businesses, and capital expenditures related to the construction of new tower sites. Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we continued this effort by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, and since 2004, by using cash flow from operations to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt to reduce our net total indebtedness. In 2005, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2006 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2006. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below. We expect our 2006 cash needs related to indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2005, to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $189.0 million, approximately $179.5 million for the February 1, 2006 redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes, and capital lease payments and other notes payable (including interest) of approximately $5.2 million. We expect to fund capital expenditures of between $110.0 and $130.0 million, principally related to new tower construction, improvements to existing towers and installation of new in building systems in 2006. We also expect to use approximately $22.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares of ATC South America that we do not own, as discussed above in Business Recent Transactions ATC International Transactions. In addition, we expect to continue to fund our stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional $673.4 million of our Class A common stock in 2006. We also may fund additional purchases of our Class A common stock, either pursuant to, or supplemental to, our stock repurchase program. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Program. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. We expect to utilize cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods. The program may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March 9, 2006, we repurchased an additional 3.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. 46 Table of Contents Tower Construction and Improvements and In Building System Installation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $88.6 million, including capital expenditures incurred in connection with the construction of 245 towers and the installation of 14 in building systems. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2006 we will build approximately 275 new towers and install approximately 40 new in building systems, and expect our 2006 total capital expenditures for construction, improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately $110.0 million and $130.0 million. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. For more information about our financing activities, see Financing Activities below. In October 2005, we also refinanced the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility with new credit facilities. (See Sources of Cash below.) In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February 1, 2006. (See Financing Activities below.) Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facilities and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total American Tower credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A $ 750,000 $ 750,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 43,000 43,000 SpectraSite credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A 700,000 700,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes(2) $ 179,488 179,488 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 400,000 400,000 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes(3) $ 275,688 275,688 3.25% convertible notes 152,911 152,911 3.00% convertible notes 345,000 345,000 2.25% convertible notes 47 47 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 179,535 275,688 1,645,911 1,470,000 3,571,134 Cash interest expense(1)(2) 189,000 177,000 $ 175,000 $ 175,000 161,000 138,000 1,015,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,241 4,395 4,025 3,719 3,776 212,743 233,899 Operating lease payments(4) 190,129 183,595 180,910 178,456 172,060 2,507,444 3,412,594 Other long term liabilities(5) 400 1,098 437 450 463 165,071 167,919 Total $ 564,305 $ 641,776 $ 360,372 $ 357,625 $ 1,983,210 $ 4,493,258 $ 8,400,546 (1) For more information regarding the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, see Sources of Cash below. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank 47 Table of Contents Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375% per annum, based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the credit facilities. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2005 for the credit facilities was 4.71%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in our credit facilities agreements, is 4.53% through their maturity on October 27, 2010. (2) The ATI 12.25% Notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining outstanding debt under the ATI 12.25% Notes was $227.7 million face amount ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). On December 22, 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption on February 1, 2006, of all remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. Pursuant to the indenture for the notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. On February 1, 2006 we redeemed $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. (3) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. (4) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (5) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2005, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived solely from distributions from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are ATI and SpectraSite. Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc. Under the American Tower credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes, ATI and American Tower International are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us. SpectraSite is subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us under the SpectraSite credit facility, but as a result of its designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, it is not subject to such restrictions under the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.047 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $112.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $488.8 million under the American Tower credit facility and approximately $445.4 million under the SpectraSite credit facility. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our cash provided by operating activities was $397.2 million, $216.7 million and $156.4 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2006 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See Results of Operations above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of our Class A common stock. 48 Table of Contents New Credit Facilities. In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. The new American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, a $750.0 million Term Loan A, and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the outstanding $745.0 million under the previous American Tower credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $300.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $18.2 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. In December 2005, we drew down $43.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance repurchases of the ATI 12.25% Notes. In January 2006, we drew down an additional $179.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October 27, 2006 will be canceled. The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include ATI, American Tower, L.P., American Tower International and American Tower LLC. We and the borrowers restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries. The American Tower credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October 27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The American Tower credit facility does not require amortization of principal payments and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new American Tower credit facility, please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The new SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, a $700.0 million Term Loan A, and a $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the $697.0 million outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $250.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October 27, 2006 will be canceled. The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite, LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries. The SpectraSite credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October 27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The SpectraSite credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new SpectraSite credit facility, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we received approximately $1.8 million in proceeds from exercises of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock and approximately $63.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed an aggregate of $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, representing all of the outstanding 9 3/8% Notes. We completed 49 Table of Contents partial redemptions of the 9 3/8% Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture in January, July and September 2005 for an aggregate redemption price of $288.3 million, plus approximately $9.5 million in accrued interest. ATI 12.25% Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $270.6 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($177.8 million accreted value, net of $10.1 million fair value allocated to warrants) for approximately $208.4 million in cash, in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $227.7 face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). In December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February 1, 2006, we redeemed an aggregate of $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. 3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2005, holders of an aggregate of $57.1 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 4.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of our Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $4.9 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2005, $152.9 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. Between January 1, 2006 and March 9, 2006, holders of an additional $22.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 1.8 million shares of our Class A common stock. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $1.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into eight interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under our new credit facilities. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $450.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.85% and expire in October 2010. During January 2006, we also entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.68% and will expire in October 2010. We have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities. The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply: a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries. 50 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined) and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the American Tower credit facility. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indenture restricts ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock, other than debt under the American Tower credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2005, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $373.8 million, $457.1 million, $179.0 million, $178.7 million, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this annual report under the caption Risk Factors. 51 Table of Contents In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and or equity securities. As of December 31, 2005, we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations, stock based compensation, impairment of assets and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K/A, beginning on page F 7. Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2005, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $348.8 million, including approximately $173.3 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Approximately $161.5 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowance was assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in 52 Table of Contents depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2025. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2005. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. Purchase Price Allocation. We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, such as our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005 for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion, including the fair value of shares of Class A common stock issued, the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs. We are in the process of finalizing a third party valuation of SpectraSites property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information on managements estimates and assumptions is obtained and the third party valuation is finalized. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of property and equipment, intangibles, restructuring and merger related liabilities, other assumed liabilities, deferred income taxes and residual goodwill of approximately $1.5 billion. Changes to the valuation of these items may result in adjustments to the overall purchase price allocation of these items and the related depreciation and amortization. Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FIN No. 47. Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. This adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately $114.0 million to $164.2 million as of December 31, 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Stock Based Compensation. We measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority, the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred. Generally, this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or, if grant authority has been delegated to management, when the shares are allocated to specific individuals. The stock based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method, whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting. The actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent investigation of our stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards. While our financial statements have used the above measure, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123) also historically required that we present in the footnotes to our financial statements pro forma financial results as if a fair value method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument were applied. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock option is determined using an option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense. As a result, we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after July 1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). We made this change based on a number of factors, including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non core businesses, reduce leverage and refinance our debt and our merger with SpectraSite. We had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future. Our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans. 54 Table of Contents In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R) which supersedes APB No. 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We adopted SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. These fair value and forfeiture assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. For more information on SFAS No. 123R, see Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non Core Long Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows, as well as through other analytical methods. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2005, 2004 and 2003, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2005 annual impairment testing included $1.5 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $30.3 million, $24.8 million and $22.9 million respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB No. 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. This statement addressed the accounting for share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options. Under the new 55 Table of Contents standard, companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No. 25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations. SFAS No. 123R is effective for us as of January 1, 2006. We have historically accounted for share based payments to employees under APB No. 25s intrinsic value method. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS No. 123R is recognized based on SFAS No. 123. Tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations. We estimate that we will recognize stock based compensation expense of approximately $38 million to $40 million for the year ending December 31, 2006 under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. This amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006, including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required. We cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other factors, future employee stock option exercises. Due to the our tax loss position, there was no operating cash inflow realized for December 31, 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. We will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes (collectively, the Notes). The information contained in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements is also presented to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our ATI 7.25% Notes. The indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes. In order for the holders of the Notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for the Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2005, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 5.5. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity. 56 Table of Contents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow are considered non GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for the Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for the Notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2005 $ 139,590 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 $ 496,783 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 (524,804 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2005 558,360 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 $ 530,339 Non Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 $ (32,067 ) 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. All derivative financial instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased, redeemed and converted $605.7 million face amount of outstanding debt securities for $501.7 million in cash, including the repurchase of $270.6 million face amount ($177.8 million accreted value) of ATI 12.25% Notes, the redemption of $274.9 million principal amount of 9 3/8% Notes and the conversion of $57.1 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. In connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. we also assumed $702.5 million of debt at fair value consisting primarily of borrowings outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.
