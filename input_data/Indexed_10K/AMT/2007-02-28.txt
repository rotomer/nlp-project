ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates on page 46. Our continuing operations are reported in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit (loss) for the rental and management segment include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98.2% and 98.4% of our total revenues and approximately 99.2% and 99.5% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2006 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During 2006, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2006 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 28 Table of Contents wireless and broadcast towers and in building systems in the United States. The merger was approved by our and SpectraSites stockholders on August 3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in our consolidated results of operations since that date. During the year ended December 31, 2006 and during the period August 3, 2005 through December 31, 2005, SpectraSite contributed total revenues of $445.4 million and $171.2 million, respectively, and segment operating profit of $294.2 million and $106.8 million, respectively, to our rental and management segment. Our revenue growth in 2006 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2006, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, was approximately $79.1 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites, including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2007. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. In addition to the approximately 7,800 towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we constructed or acquired 325 and 289 sites in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year over year comparisons. During 2006, incremental revenue attributable to these 614 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, was approximately $11.0 million. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2006 2005 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,294,068 $ 929,762 $ 364,306 39 % Network development services 23,317 15,024 8,293 55 Total revenues 1,317,385 944,786 372,599 39 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 332,246 247,781 84,465 34 Network development services 11,291 8,346 2,945 35 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 528,051 411,254 116,797 28 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $39,502 and $6,597 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 159,324 108,059 51,265 47 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 of stock based compensation expense in 2005) 2,572 34,232 (31,660 ) (92 ) Total operating expenses 1,033,484 809,672 223,812 28 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,491 and $1,492 14,208 14,232 (24 ) (0 ) Interest income 9,002 4,402 4,600 104 Interest expense (215,643 ) (222,419 ) (6,776 ) (3 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (27,223 ) (67,110 ) (39,887 ) (59 ) Other income 6,619 227 6,392 2,816 Income tax provision (41,768 ) (5,714 ) 36,054 631 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (784 ) (575 ) 209 36 Income (loss) on equity method investments 26 (2,078 ) 2,104 101 Loss from discontinued operations, net (854 ) (1,913 ) (1,059 ) (55 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) (35,525 ) N/A Net income (loss) $ 27,484 $ (181,359 ) $ 208,843 115 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,317.4 million, an increase of $372.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.6 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $90.1 and an increase in other network development services revenue of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,294.1 million, an increase of $364.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.2 million of the increase was 30 Table of Contents attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $79.1 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $11.0 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 614 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. We believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $23.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million from year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services due to the increased business associated with our significantly larger communications site portfolio, primarily as a result of sites acquired from SpectraSite. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,033.5 million, an increase of $223.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $116.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $84.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $51.3 million and an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $2.9 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in impairments, net loss of sale on long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $31.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $332.2 million, an increase of $84.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $78.8 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Approximately $2.8 million of the increase was related to approximately 614 sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than sites acquired from SpectraSite. The remaining $2.9 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, primarily related to increases in ground rent expense. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $976.0 million, an increase of $279.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $195.5 million of the increase resulted from communications sites acquired from SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue, net of related expenses, described above. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $914.9 million, an increase of $277.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was comprised of the $279.8 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of a $2.7 million increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of the increase correlates directly to the increase in services performed as noted above. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $528.1 million, an increase of $116.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $116.2 million of the increase was attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $159.3 million, an increase of $51.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $32.9 million in stock based compensation expense and $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices and related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. See Stock Option Review and Related Matters below. The remaining net increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of SpectraSite expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the five months post merger for the year ended December 31, 2005. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $31.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $16.1 million decrease in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets, an $11.3 million decrease in stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes associated with restructuring and merger activities and a $3.1 million decrease in severance, retention and other employee expenses associated with the 2005 SpectraSite merger. The net decrease of $16.1 million in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets was primarily comprised of a $9.2 million reduction in impairments related to towers with no current tenant leases and gains from asset sales totaling $5.1 million. The gains from asset sales included the sale of 27 towers in one transaction and sales of other non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $215.6 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in interest expense of approximately $49.8 million as a result of redemptions and repurchases of outstanding debt securities, offset by additional interest incurred related to the SpectraSite credit facility and higher borrowing levels on the American Tower credit facility totaling approximately $45.3 million. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes. In connection with these transactions, we paid the noteholders an aggregate of $104.0 million in cash, including accrued interest. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009 (9 3/8% Notes), repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower 32 Table of Contents and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million gain realized during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 from the sale of 1.6 million shares of FiberTower Corporation, an investment we had previously accounted for under the cost method. We plan to sell all or a portion of our remaining holdings of 3.9 million shares of FiberTower during 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006 we have recorded these shares as available for sale securities within the current assets of our consolidated balance sheet, with an unrealized gain of $10.4 million, net of tax, recorded within other comprehensive income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $41.8 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of $36.1 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below, foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims during the year ended December 31, 2005, and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus interest. We expect settlement of this matter in the first half of 2007, however, there can be no assurances with respect to the timing of any refund. Because of the uncertainty associated with the claim, we have not recognized any amounts related to interest. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.8 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss from discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. We also expect to incur additional costs in connection with these proceedings. 33 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2005 2004 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 929,762 $ 684,422 $ 245,340 36 % Network development services 15,024 22,238 (7,214 ) (32 ) Total revenues 944,786 706,660 238,126 34 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 247,781 195,242 52,539 27 Network development services 8,346 16,220 (7,874 ) (49 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 411,254 329,449 81,805 25 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $6,597 and $9,874 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 108,059 83,094 24,965 30 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 and $876 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 34,232 23,876 10,356 43 Total operating expenses 809,672 647,881 161,791 25 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,492 and $1,497 14,232 14,316 (84 ) (1 ) Interest income 4,402 4,844 (442 ) (9 ) Interest expense (222,419 ) (262,237 ) (39,818 ) (15 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (67,110 ) (138,016 ) (70,906 ) (51 ) Other income (expense) 227 (2,798 ) (3,025 ) (108 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (5,714 ) 83,338 (89,052 ) (107 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (575 ) (2,366 ) (1,791 ) (76 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,078 ) (2,915 ) (837 ) (29 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (1,913 ) (8,409 ) (6,496 ) (77 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) 35,525 N/A Net loss $ (181,359 ) $ (255,464 ) $ (74,105 ) (29 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $944.8 million, an increase of $238.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $74.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $7.2 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $929.8 million, an increase of $245.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $63.3 million of the increase resulted from 34 Table of Contents incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $10.8 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million from year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services, primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services, as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $809.7 million, an increase of $161.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $81.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $52.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $25.0 million, and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $10.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $247.8 million, an increase of $52.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $53.1 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Excluding the impact of expenses incurred by SpectraSite, rental and management expense did not change materially as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $696.2 million, an increase of $192.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $118.1 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment operating profit generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of January 1, 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $7.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $411.3 million, an increase of $81.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to approximately $78.0 million of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger and approximately $3.8 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other long lived assets. 35 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $108.1 million, an increase of $25.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $18.6 million of the increase was attributable to general and administrative expense incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses, including amounts paid in connection with the closing of the SpectraSite merger, offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in stock based compensation expense, which aggregated $6.6 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $34.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to merger related expense of $9.0 million incurred in connection with the SpectraSite merger, including employee separation costs of $3.1 million, amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of $2.4 million and other employee stock option charges of $3.5 million. Restructuring expense and stock based compensation expense also increased by $4.6 million related to modified option awards, which was partially offset by a decline of $3.2 million in impairments and net losses on sales of long lived non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $222.4 million, a decrease of $39.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, repurchases of our ATI 12.25% Notes, conversions of our 3.25% Notes and the refinancing of the American Tower credit facility at lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 7.50% Notes, 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) and 7.125% Notes issued in February, August and September of 2004, respectively, and approximately $15.2 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes, redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, ATI 12.25% Notes and 5.0% Notes, and refinanced of our credit facility. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $138.0 million charge related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million from other expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $2.9 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.7 million, as compared to an $83.3 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing a decrease of $89.1 million from 36 Table of Contents the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. Minority Interest in Net Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a result of the Companys purchase during 2004 of the remaining 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico that it did not own. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.9 million, as compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.8 million related to the results of operations through the date of sale of our tower construction services unit and Kline, as well as a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No. 47). As a result, we recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. The acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other long term obligations of $114.0 million. Stock Option Review and Related Matters During the year ended December 31, 2006, we conducted a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting. In May 2006, we reported that our Board of Directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic auditors. In November 2006, the special committee reported to the Board of Directors regarding its findings, including that, for certain stock option grants, the legal grant dates when all necessary corporate action had been taken differed from the dates previously recorded for financial accounting and tax purposes. As a result of the special committees findings, we restated our historical financial statements to, among other things, record charges for stock based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax related consequences. In November 2006, we filed an Amendment No. 1 to our annual report on Form 10 K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005, an 37 Table of Contents Amendment No. 1 to our quarterly report on Form 10 Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 to reflect the impact of the restatement on our historical financial statements. In addition, in February 2007, in response to additional SEC guidance, we filed an Amendment No. 2 to our annual report on Form 10 K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005. In connection with its review of our stock option granting practices, the special committee recommended a remediation plan to the Board of Directors to address the issues raised by its findings. In December 2006, we reported that the Board of Directors approved the remediation plan, which included, among other things, the elimination of any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the Board of Directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the legal grant date, as determined by the special committee. For outstanding options, this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date, without any compensation to the optionholder. In December 2006, eight of our senior officers and Directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 985,511 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $6.5 million. For options that had been exercised, this was accomplished by compensating the Company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise, after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual. In January 2007, five of the Companys senior officers surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of 23,269 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.6 million (net of approximately $0.4 million in taxes paid by such individuals). In addition, we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value. In December 2006 and January 2007, two former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 423,333 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $1.0 million, and surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.1 million (net of taxes paid by such individuals). As a result of the review of our stock option granting practices, we determined that a number of stock options were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. Under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A), part of recently enacted tax legislation, options that were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after December 31, 2004 will likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant. In order to compensate our non executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under Section 409A, we made cash payments on behalf of such individuals for these taxes in January 2007 for an aggregate of approximately $0.8 million. In order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of Section 409A on holders of outstanding options, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 for the affected options, pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the quoted market price on the revised grant date, and to give the option holders (excluding officers and Directors) a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price. Following completion of the tender offer, in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. As discussed above in Item 3 of this annual report under the caption Legal Proceedings, we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC, a subpoena from the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and an information document request from the IRS, each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices. In addition, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our stock option granting practices. In connection with the review of our stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect that significant legal expenditures will continue to be incurred in the future. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we improved our financial position by refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which increased our flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2006 transactions included the following: The redemption, conversion or repurchase of approximately $371.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities and with respect to conversions of convertible notes, shares of our Class A common stock. The repurchase of approximately 10.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $321.8 million under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased approximately 12.9 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $398.4 million under this program. As of December 31, 2006, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.5 billion. Prior to 2002, we incurred indebtedness to fund the acquisition of tower sites and construction of new tower sites, and to fund acquisitions of businesses related to our services and satellite segments. Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. Since then, we have sold businesses and assets that did not provide incremental value to our site leasing business, and we have taken steps to refinance our indebtedness, extend maturity dates, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility. In addition, since 2004, we have used cash flow from operations to redeem and repurchase outstanding debt. In 2006, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2007 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2007. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below. Our debt service obligations as of December 31, 2006 are set forth under Uses of Cash Contractual Obligations below, which reflects an aggregate of $446.2 million of cash payments to be made in 2007. This amount includes $252.2 million related to the repurchase obligations for our 5.0% Notes, due to the noteholders rights to require us to purchase their notes on February 20, 2007. In February 2007, we conducted a tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer, $59.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. Accordingly, giving effect to the completion of the tender offer, our remaining debt service obligations for 2007 aggregate $194.0 million. In 2007, we expect to fund capital expenditures of between $130.0 and $150.0 million, principally related to new tower construction, improvements to existing towers and installation of new in building systems. In addition, we expect to continue to fund our current $750 million stock repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by the end of February 2007, as well as our new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. We also may fund additional purchases of our Class A common stock, either pursuant to, or supplemental to, our stock repurchase program. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and future financing transactions. During 2007, we expect that we will raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. As set forth below under Sources of Cash Credit Facilities, in February 2007, we secured an additional $550.0 million of revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities. During the first half of 2007, we also anticipate raising additional capital through a securitization of the majority of the towers in our SpectraSite portfolio. 39 Table of Contents Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Program. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. On May 23, 2006, we announced that we were temporarily suspending repurchases under the stock repurchase program in light of the uncertainty surrounding the pending review of our stock option granting practices and the related governmental proceedings. On December 20, 2006, we announced that we were resuming repurchases of our Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $321.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased an aggregate of 12.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $398.4 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Between January 1, 2007 and February 20, 2007, we repurchased an additional 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $287.1 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. We expect to utilize cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, and borrowings from potential future financings to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we plan to make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods. Tower Maintenance and Improvements, Tower Construction and In Building System Installation, and Tower and Land Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2006, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $127.1 million, including $60.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communication sites, $44.9 million spent in connection with the construction of 213 towers and the installation of 22 in building systems, $12.3 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground leases, and $9.4 million spent on non site specific capital expenditures. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent $14.3 million to acquire 84 towers and 6 in building systems. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2007 we will build approximately 200 new towers and install approximately 25 new in building systems. We expect that our 2007 capital expenditures will be between approximately $130.0 million and $150.0 million, including approximately $30.0 million for land purchases. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we redeemed, converted or repurchased approximately $371.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities and with respect to conversions of convertible notes, shares of our Class A common stock. These refinancing and repurchase activities included the redemption of $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of the ATI 12.25% Notes, the conversion of $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes, the repurchase of $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and the repurchase of $74.9 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. For more information about our financing activities, see Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. ATC South America. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we used cash from operations to fund the repurchase of the remaining 9.3% minority interest in ATC South America not owned by us. In April 2006, we 40 Table of Contents paid a total of $22.9 million in connection with the repurchase of these interests from stockholders of ATC South America, including J. Michael Gearon, Jr. and William H. Hess, executive officers of the Company. Giving effect to these repurchases, we now own 100% of ATC South America (see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). Expenses Related to Stock Option Review and Related Matters. In connection with the review of our stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect that significant legal expenditures will continue to be incurred in the future. For more information regarding the review of our stock option granting practices and the related proceedings, please see Stock Option Review and Related Matters above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices, the related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. In addition, depending on the outcomes of these proceedings, we could be subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other liability. We also incurred costs associated with the tender offer for stock options that were determined to have been granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. As discussed above in Stock Option Review and Related Matters, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 and in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facilities and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total American Tower credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A $ 750,000 $ 750,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 250,000 250,000 SpectraSite credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A 700,000 700,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 25,000 25,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 325,075 325,075 7.50% senior notes $ 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes(2) $ 252,188 252,188 3.25% convertible notes 107,869 107,869 3.00% convertible notes 344,999 344,999 2.25% convertible notes 40 40 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 252,228 $ 1,832,869 $ 325,075 $ 1,069,999 $ 3,480,171 Cash interest expense(1) 189,000 187,000 187,000 172,000 85,000 41,000 861,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 4,965 4,507 3,880 3,788 16,802 195,880 229,822 Total debt service obligations $ 446,193 $ 191,507 $ 190,880 $ 2,008,657 $ 426,877 $ 1,306,879 $ 4,570,993 Operating lease payments(3) 208,257 202,212 199,286 192,487 184,406 2,529,484 3,516,132 Other long term liabilities(4) 155 1,852 167 176 253 178,254 180,857 Total $ 654,605 $ 395,571 $ 390,333 $ 2,201,320 $ 611,536 $ 4,014,617 $ 8,267,982 41 Table of Contents (1) For more information regarding the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, see Sources of Cash below. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375% per annum, based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the credit facilities. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for the credit facilities was 5.30%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in our credit facilities agreements, is 5.37% through their maturity on October 27, 2010. (2) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2006, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived primarily from distributions from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are ATI and SpectraSite. Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc. Under the American Tower credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes, ATI and American Tower International are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us. SpectraSite is subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that it can distribute to us under the SpectraSite credit facility, but as a result of its designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, it is not subject to such restrictions under the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $808.9 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $281.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $282.2 million under the American Tower credit facility and approximately $245.4 million under the SpectraSite credit facility. In February 2007, we entered into two incremental revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million revolving loan under the American Tower credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving loan under the SpectraSite credit facility, both of which remained undrawn at closing. In addition, in February 2007, we drew down $250.0 million of the existing revolving loans under the American Tower credit facility to fund the cash tender offer for our 5.0% Notes. As of February 22, 2007, our available liquidity under the American Tower credit facility was approximately $331.9 million and our available liquidity under the SpectraSite credit facility was approximately $495.4 million. 42 Table of Contents Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our cash provided by operating activities was $620.7 million, $397.2 million and $216.7 million, respectively. Our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2007 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See Results of Operations above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of our Class A common stock. Credit Facilities. In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. For more information regarding our credit facilities, please see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we drew down $207.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the American Tower credit facility to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. As of December 31, 2006, the American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (against which approximately $17.8 million of undrawn letters of credit are outstanding at December 31, 2006), maturing on October 27, 2010; a $750.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010; and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we drew down $25.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the SpectraSite credit facility to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. In addition, on October 27, 2006, the remaining $175.0 million undrawn portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the SpectraSite credit facility was canceled pursuant to its terms. As of December 31, 2006, the SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2006), maturing on October 27, 2010; a $700.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010; and a $25.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, which is fully drawn. In February 2007, we entered into two incremental revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million revolving loan under the American Tower credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving loan under the SpectraSite credit facility. These revolving loans have terms that are consistent with those of the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility, and they mature on October 27, 2010. All amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The credit facilities and the new revolving loans do not require amortization of payments and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include American Tower L.P., ATI, American Tower International and American Tower LLC. We and the borrowers restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries. Following the closing of the new incremental revolving loan commitments, the American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, a $300.0 million incremental revolving credit facility, a $750.0 million Term Loan A and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries. Following the closing of the new incremental revolving loan commitments, the SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, a $250.0 incremental revolving credit facility, a $700.0 million Term Loan A and a $25.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. 43 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we received approximately $0.3 million in proceeds from exercises of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock and an aggregate of approximately $40.6 million in proceeds from exercises of options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our stock option plans and sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. Proceeds from the Sale of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $35.4 million in aggregate net proceeds related to sales of non core assets, including $30.5 million from sales of tower assets and buildings and $4.9 million from sales of investments.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 3,684,794 shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the date of conversion and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2006, $107.9 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. In February 2007, holders of an additional $44.4 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes. In connection with these conversions, we issued an aggregate of 3,635,220 shares of Class A common stock and we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $2.0 million. 5.0% Convertible Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions $23.5 million of 5.0% Notes for $23.4 million in cash. As of December 31, 2006, $252.2 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes. Pursuant to the tender offer we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer, $59.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 7.25% Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes for $77.3 million in cash. As of December 31, 2006, $325.1 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 12.25% Notes Redemption. In December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption on February 1, 2006 of all outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. We used $0.5 million in cash on hand and $179.0 million in borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the American Tower credit facility to fund the redemption. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into four interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt, which we expect to be issued on or before July 31, 2007. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $900.0 million and fixed rates ranging from 4.73% to 5.10%, and will be terminated upon issuance of new fixed rate debt. We have designated these forward starting interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to market risk for decreases in interest rates until termination of the swap and if we fail to issue such new fixed rate debt on or before such date. As of December 31, 2006, we expect to receive the fair value of these swap agreements of approximately $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we would be required to pay approximately $19.1 million in cash upon settlement of 44 Table of Contents the swaps if a decline of 10%, or approximately 50 basis points, in interest rates were to occur from the fixed rate of the swaps between the issuance date and the settlement date of the swaps. In February 2007, we also entered into two similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of 5.06%. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2006 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities. The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply: a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined) and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the American Tower credit facility. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indenture restricts ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock, other than debt under the American Tower credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or 45 Table of Contents issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2006, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $446.2 million, $191.5 million, $190.9 million, $2.0 billion, $426.9 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this annual report under the caption Risk Factors. In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such refinancings or, if such refinancings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and or equity securities. As of December 31, 2006, we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to this registration statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations, stock based compensation, impairment of assets and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting 46 Table of Contents treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, beginning on page F 7. Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 Accounting For Income Taxes, requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2006, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $308.2 million, including approximately $153.6 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. Approximately $148.3 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowances as of December 31, 2006 will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims during the year ended December 31, 2005, and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus interest. We expect settlement of this matter in the first half of 2007, however, there can be no assurances with respect to the timing of any refund. Because of the uncertainty associated with the claim, we have not recognized any amounts related to interest. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2026. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2006. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 9 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. Prior to commencement of the 47 Table of Contents bankruptcy proceedings, we had advanced over $522.0 million to fund Verestars operations. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. Purchase Price Allocation. We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, such as our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005 for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion, including the fair value of shares of Class A common stock issued, the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs. As of December 31, 2005 we were in the process of finalizing a third party valuation of SpectraSites property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities were based on preliminary valuations that were subject to adjustment as additional information on managements estimates and assumptions were obtained and the third party valuation was finalized. We completed our third party valuation and an analysis of the acquired tenant and ground leases in June 2006, which formed the basis for determining the cash flows used to value the customer intangible assets acquired and the estimated useful lives of the acquired assets. The final allocation of the purchase price resulted in changes to the fair values of certain assets and liabilities disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005, as follows: a decrease of $80.0 million in total intangible assets, a decrease of $9.2 million in total tangible assets, a decrease of $33.3 million in the net deferred income tax liability, an increase of $1.4 million in other liabilities, and a corresponding increase of $54.5 million in goodwill. We accounted for the difference between the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the preliminary and final allocation of the purchase price as a change in accounting estimate under SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The impact of this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively and was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, nor will it be material to future periods. Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FIN No. 47. Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we updated our assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net (decrease) increase in the estimated obligation of $(0.7) million and $2.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we also adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. This adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately $114.0 million to $162.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our 48 Table of Contents settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Stock Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R supersedes the Companys previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Under SFAS No. 123R, we are no longer permitted to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25 described below. Instead, we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method, pursuant to which compensation expense for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined using an Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 described below and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Under APB No. 25, the Company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FAS 123R 3). Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No.123R. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we elected the Long method, as defined in the FAS 123R 3. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS No. 109 and EITF Topic D 32, Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations, we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently 49 Table of Contents available to us. We measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority, the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred. Generally, this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or, if grant authority has been delegated to management, when the shares are allocated to specific individuals. The stock based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method, whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting. The actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards. While our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 have used the above measure, SFAS No. 123 also historically required that we present in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements pro forma financial results as if a fair value method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument were applied. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock option is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the disclosure of pro forma compensation expense. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense. As a result, we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after July 1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). We made this change based on a number of factors, including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non core businesses, reduce leverage and our merger with SpectraSite. We had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future. Our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans. Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non Core Long Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows, or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate 50 Table of Contents of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2006, 2005 and 2004, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2005 and 2006 annual impairment testing included approximately $1.6 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 approximated $58.3 million, $30.3 million and $24.8 million, respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for us as of January 1, 2007, and the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB No. 108). SAB No. 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff has indicated that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB No. 108 is effective for companies with fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB No. 108 during 2006, and the impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity was not material. 51 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes (collectively, the Notes). The information contained in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements is also presented to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our ATI 7.25% Notes. The indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes. In order for the holders of the Notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for the Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2006, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 4.6. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity. Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow are considered non GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for the Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for the Notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. These financial metrics do not include the results of SpectraSite or its subsidiaries because such entities are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for the Notes. The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2006 $ 157,311 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ 591, 050 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 (612,366 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2006 629,244 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ 607,928 Non Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ (22,614 ) 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. All derivative financial instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased, redeemed and converted $371.1 million face amount of outstanding debt securities for $283.5 million in cash, including the redemption of $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of the ATI 12.25% Notes, the conversion of $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes, the repurchase of $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and the repurchase of $74.9 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we also drew down an aggregate of $232.0 million under the Delayed Draw Term Loan components of our American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for our credit facilities was 5.30%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.92%. As of December 31, 2005, variable rate debt consists of the new American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities ($1,493.0 million) that were refinanced on October 27, 2005, which are included above based on their October 27, 2010 maturity dates. As of December 31, 2005, fixed rate debt consists of: the 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (2.25% Notes) ($0.1 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2005 is $501.9 million); the 5.0% Notes ($275.7 million); the 3.25% Notes ($152.9 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($400.0 million); the ATI 12.25% Notes ($227.7 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2005 is $160.3 million accreted value, net of the allocated fair value of the related warrants of $7.2 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2005 is $344.4 million accreted value) and other debt of $60.4 million. Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2005 for our credit facilities was 4.71%. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.03%. (b) Includes notional amount of $25,000 that expires in September 2007. (c) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (d) Includes notional amounts of $300,000 that expire in December 2009. (e) Includes notional amounts of $550,000 that expire in October 2010. (f) Includes notional amounts of $900,000 for forward starting swaps that expire in July 2012. (g) Includes notional amount of $175,000 that expired in February 2006.

Our foreign operations include rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. The remeasurement gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $1,304,000, and $396,000 and $(146,000), respectively. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt under our credit facilities, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements (excluding $900.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge as of December 31, 2006, against a future fixed rate debt obligation), is comprised of $875.0 million and $743.0 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A 10% increase, or approximately 53 and 47 basis point increase in interest rates for the years 54 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have caused an additional pre tax charge in our net income (loss) and an increase in our cash outflows of $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we maintain four interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt, which we expect to be issued on or before July 31, 2007. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $900.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.97%, and will be terminated upon issuance of new fixed rate debt. We are exposed to market risk for decreases in interest rates until termination of the swaps and if we fail to issue such new fixed rate debt on or before such date. As of December 31, 2006, we expected to receive the fair value of these swap agreements of approximately $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we would be required to pay approximately $19.1 million in cash upon settlement of the swaps if a 10% decline, or approximately 50 basis points, in interest rates were to occur from the fixed rate of the swaps between the issuance date and the settlement date of the swaps. In February 2007, we also entered into two similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of 5.06%.
