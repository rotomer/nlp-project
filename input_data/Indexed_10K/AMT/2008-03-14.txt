ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning at page 50. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long term obligations, other income (expense), minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2007 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which has the effect of increasing the non cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2007, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. 28 Table of Contents A significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2007 was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2007, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, was approximately $118.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2008. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. We constructed or acquired 462 and 325 sites in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year over year comparisons. During 2007, incremental revenue attributable to these approximately 790 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, was approximately $13.6 million. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in building distributed antenna systems in the United States, in August 2005. As a result, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 differ significantly from our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, because our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 include SpectraSite, Inc. for only the five month period following the merger, whereas our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, include SpectraSite, Inc. for each full year period. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2007 2006 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,425,975 $ 1,294,068 $ 131,907 10 % Network development services 30,619 23,317 7,302 31 Total revenues 1,456,594 1,317,385 139,209 11 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 343,450 332,246 11,204 3 Network development services 16,172 11,291 4,881 43 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 522,928 528,051 (5,123 ) (1 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $54,603 and $39,502 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 186,483 159,324 27,159 17 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense 9,198 2,572 6,626 258 Total operating expenses 1,078,231 1,033,484 44,747 4 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,490 and $1,491 14,207 14,208 (1 ) Interest income 10,848 9,002 1,846 21 Interest expense (235,824 ) (215,643 ) 20,181 9 Loss on retirement of long term obligations (35,429 ) (27,223 ) 8,206 30 Other income 20,675 6,619 14,056 212 Income tax provision (59,809 ) (41,768 ) 18,041 43 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (338 ) (784 ) (446 ) (57 ) Income on equity method investments 19 26 (7 ) (27 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (36,396 ) (854 ) 35,542 4,162 Net income $ 56,316 $ 27,484 $ 28,832 105 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,456.6 million, an increase of $139.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $131.9 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $7.3 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,426.0 million, an increase of $131.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $118.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight line accounting 30 Table of Contents treatment, favorable currency exchange rates and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase resulted from approximately 790 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. We believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $30.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services, related in part to our January 2007 acquisition of a structural analysis engineering firm, which enabled us to increase our structural analysis capabilities. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, however, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,078.2 million, an increase of $44.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $27.2 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $11.2 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $4.9 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $6.6 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $5.1 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $343.5 million, an increase of $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and approximately $3.7 million of the increase was related to approximately 790 sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2006 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,096.7 million, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,030.8 million, an increase of $115.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. This was comprised of the $120.7 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $4.8 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $522.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to the finalization in June 2006 of the purchase price allocation related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger, which resulted in decreases in the fair values of certain intangible assets and changes in the estimated useful lives of certain tangible and intangible assets. As discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets. We now have over ten years of operating history, and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review, and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of 2008, which we are in the process of analyzing. If we conclude that a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate, we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change. Based on preliminary information obtained to date, we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended, which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization, and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $186.5 million, an increase of $27.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $15.1 million in stock based compensation expense and a decrease of $2.3 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. See Stock Option Review and Related Matters below. Stock based compensation expense included $7.6 million related to the modification of certain stock option awards for two members of senior management who terminated their employment during the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining $14.4 million net increase was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation expenses other than stock based compensation expense, primarily related to administrative, information technology and business development activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $9.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest earning cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $235.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 9% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 32 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the AMT OpCo level and terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of our ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $20.7 million, an increase of $14.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $5.5 million of gains recognized on the sale of our common stock investment in FiberTower Corporation and an increase of $6.2 million in gains recognized from the mark to market and subsequent settlement of certain interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $59.8 million, as compared to $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase of $18.0 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of $27.6 million of valuation allowances on net state deferred tax assets offset by a $7.6 million deferred tax liability recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2007 related to unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans with our Brazilian subsidiary. These items are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non deductible stock based compensation expense, additional tax reserves and state taxes. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to foreign items, non deductible losses on conversions of our 3.25% Notes and state taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we also received a federal income tax refund from the IRS of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest. The refund resulted from claims by us filed with the IRS in June 2003 and October 2003, which related to the carry back of net operating losses. 33 Table of Contents During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods. The adjustments were identified in connection with our year end tax analyses and audit of the consolidated financial statements and relate primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities. Recording these out of period adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2007 had the effect of increasing the income tax provision by $7.9 million and decreasing income from continuing operations by approximately $4.8 million (inclusive of certain non tax related adjustments) (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net The loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $37.8 million of net losses related to Verestar and $1.4 million in net gains related to litigation and insurance settlements that were settled for less than the original estimates. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily due to the settlement of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein and the related tax effects. In November 2007, following approval by the bankruptcy court, the Verestar settlement agreement became effective, we paid the $32.0 million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed. In connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation, we determined that the benefits from certain of Verestars net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us. We had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of Verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved. Accordingly, in November 2007, we recorded $5.6 million of additional tax benefits related to Verestar. We also recorded a tax provision of $10.7 million in loss from discontinued operations, net during the three months ended December 31, 2007 to write off deferred tax assets associated with Verestar that should have been written off in 2002 and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when Verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in December 2003 (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). 34 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2006 2005 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,294,068 $ 929,762 $ 364,306 39 % Network development services 23,317 15,024 8,293 55 Total revenues 1,317,385 944,786 372,599 39 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 332,246 247,781 84,465 34 Network development services 11,291 8,346 2,945 35 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 528,051 411,254 116,797 28 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $39,502 and $6,597 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 159,324 108,059 51,265 47 Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 of stock based compensation expense in 2005) 2,572 34,232 (31,660 ) (92 ) Total operating expenses 1,033,484 809,672 223,812 28 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,491 and $1,492 14,208 14,232 (24 ) (0 ) Interest income 9,002 4,402 4,600 104 Interest expense (215,643 ) (222,419 ) (6,776 ) (3 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (27,223 ) (67,110 ) (39,887 ) (59 ) Other income 6,619 227 6,392 2,816 Income tax provision (41,768 ) (5,714 ) 36,054 631 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (784 ) (575 ) 209 36 Income (loss) on equity method investments 26 (2,078 ) 2,104 101 Loss from discontinued operations, net (854 ) (1,913 ) (1,059 ) (55 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) (35,525 ) N/A Net income (loss) $ 27,484 $ (181,359 ) $ 208,843 115 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,317.4 million, an increase of $372.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.6 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $90.1 and an increase in other network development services revenue of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,294.1 million, an increase of $364.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $79.1 million of the increase resulted from 35 Table of Contents incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $11.0 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 614 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $23.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million from year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services due to the increased business associated with our significantly larger communications site portfolio, primarily as a result of sites acquired from SpectraSite. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,033.5 million, an increase of $223.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $116.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $84.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $51.3 million and an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $2.9 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in impairments, net loss of sale on long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $31.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $332.2 million, an increase of $84.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $78.8 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Approximately $2.8 million of the increase was related to 614 sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than sites acquired from SpectraSite. The remaining $2.9 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, primarily related to increases in ground rent expense. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $976.0 million, an increase of $279.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $195.5 million of the increase resulted from communications sites acquired from SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue, net of related expenses, described above. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $914.9 million, an increase of $277.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was comprised of the $279.8 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of a $2.7 million increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of the increase correlates directly to the increase in services performed as noted above. 36 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $528.1 million, an increase of $116.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $116.2 million of the increase was attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $159.3 million, an increase of $51.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $32.9 million in stock based compensation expense and $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices and related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. See Stock Option Review and Related Matters below. The remaining net increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of SpectraSite expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the five months post merger for the year ended December 31, 2005. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $31.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $16.1 million decrease in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets, an $11.3 million decrease in stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes associated with restructuring and merger activities and a $3.1 million decrease in severance, retention and other employee expenses associated with the 2005 SpectraSite merger. The net decrease of $16.1 million in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets was primarily comprised of a $9.2 million reduction in impairments related to towers with no current tenant leases and gains from asset sales totaling $5.1 million. The gains from asset sales included the sale of 27 towers in one transaction and sales of other non core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $215.6 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in interest expense of approximately $49.8 million as a result of redemptions and repurchases of outstanding debt securities, offset by additional interest incurred related to the SpectraSite credit facility and higher borrowing levels on the AMT OpCo credit facility totaling approximately $45.3 million. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes. In connection with these transactions, we paid the noteholders an aggregate of $104.0 million in cash, including accrued interest. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009 (9 3/8% Notes), repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the AMT OpCo and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily 37 Table of Contents related to the write off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million gain realized during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 from the sale of 1.6 million shares of FiberTower Corporation, an investment we had previously accounted for under the cost method. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded our remaining 3.9 million shares of FiberTower as available for sale securities within the current assets of our consolidated balance sheet, with an unrealized gain of $10.4 million, net of tax, recorded within other comprehensive income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $41.8 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of $36.1 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims, foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.8 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss from discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. Stock Option Review and Related Matters During the year ended December 31, 2006, our Board of Directors established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006. The special committee found, among other things, that in the past, we had granted options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock with exercise prices different from the market price of our stock on the date of grant. As a result of the special committees findings, we restated our historical financial statements to, among other things, record charges for stock based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax related consequences. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved a remediation plan recommended by the special committee to address the issues raised by its findings. As part of the remediation plan, we took steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the Board of Directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the market price on the legal grant date. For outstanding options, this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date, without any compensation to the optionholder. In December 2006, eight of our senior officers and Directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 985,511 shares, thereby 38 Table of Contents eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $6.5 million. For options that had been exercised, this was accomplished by compensating the Company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise, after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual. In January 2007, five of the Companys senior officers surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of 23,269 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.6 million (net of approximately $0.4 million in taxes paid by such individuals). In addition, we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value on the legal grant date. In December 2006, January 2007 and April 2007, three former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 1,423,330 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $4.3 million, and surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of 52,212 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit, net of taxes paid by such individuals, of approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we determined that under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A), options that were granted with exercise prices below the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after December 31, 2004 would likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant. In order to compensate our non executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under Section 409A, we paid approximately $1.1 million on behalf of such individuals for these taxes during the year ended December 31, 2007. In order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of Section 409A on holders of outstanding options, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 for the affected options, pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the market price on the revised grant date, and to give the option holders (excluding officers and Directors) a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price. We accounted for the financial impact of the tender offer as a stock option modification under SFAS No. 123R resulting in an increase to stock based compensation expense and additional paid in capital of $0.3 million in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 and an additional $1.2 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2007. Following completion of the tender offer, in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. As discussed above in Item 3 of this Annual Report under the caption Legal Proceedings, we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC, a subpoena from the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, information document requests from the IRS and requests for information from the Department of Labor, each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices. In addition, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices. In connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect to continue to incur legal expenditures in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we improved our financial position by raising capital to refinance and repurchase a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2007 transactions included the following: The completion of our Securitization involving assets related to the 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities and to fund a tender offer and consent solicitation for our ATI 7.25% Notes. 39 Table of Contents The refinancing of our credit facilities, including the repayment and termination of the senior secured credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay and terminate the credit facilities of SpectraSite and to repay a portion of the AMT OpCo credit facilities. We then implemented our new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility, which we drew down in part to repay and terminate the AMT OpCo credit facilities. The completion of an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 7.00% Notes primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. The repurchase or conversion of approximately $606.8 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes, the repurchase of $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock. The repurchase of approximately 39.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2007, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.3 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2007. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2008 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2008. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below. Our debt service obligations as of December 31, 2007 are set forth under Uses of Cash Contractual Obligations below, which reflects an aggregate of $252.0 million of cash payments to be made in 2008. During 2008, we expect that we will raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Programs. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we continued to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, as described below. In February 2007, we completed our $750.0 million stock repurchase program, originally announced in November 2005. Pursuant to this repurchase program, we repurchased 8.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $351.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 31.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.3 billion pursuant to this program. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $163.7 million. As of February 29, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 35.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.45 billion pursuant to this stock repurchase program. In February 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock. We expect to fund repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and future financing transactions. Purchases under this stock repurchase program are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we plan to make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods. 40 Table of Contents For more information regarding our stock repurchase programs, please see Item 5 of this Annual Report under the caption Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Tower Maintenance and Improvements, Tower Construction and In Building System Installation, and Tower and Land Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2007, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $154.4 million, including $66.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communication sites, $30.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 152 towers and the installation of 17 in building distributed antenna systems, $44.4 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $12.7 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent $36.9 million to acquire 293 towers and $7.1 million to acquire the assets of a structural analysis engineering firm. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2008 we will construct approximately 300 to 400 new sites, including in building systems, and we expect that our 2008 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $185.0 million and $215.0 million, including between $40.0 million and $60.0 million of ground lease purchases. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we used approximately $545.8 million in cash to repurchase or convert approximately $606.8 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes, the repurchase of $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also implemented the Revolving Credit Facility and a new senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the Term Loan). All amounts outstanding under the credit facilities at our principal operating subsidiaries were repaid and then terminated during the year ended December 31, 2007. In October 2007, we also repaid and terminated the Term Loan. For more information about our financing activities, see Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt below. Expenses Related to Stock Option Review and Related Matters. In connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect to continue to incur legal expenditures in the future. For more information regarding the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related proceedings, please see Stock Option Review and Related Matters above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately $13.8 million in costs associated with legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. Depending on the outcomes of these proceedings, we and members of our senior management could be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions or other liability. In December 2007, we announced that we had reached a settlement in principle regarding the securities class action related to our historical stock option granting practices. The settlement, which was preliminarily approved by the court in February 2008, provides for a payment by us of $14.0 million and would lead to a dismissal of all claims against all defendants in the litigation. We have reached agreements with our insurers related to the settlement, pursuant to which we expect to receive approximately $12.5 million in insurance proceeds. We expect to pay the settlement amount, and receive the associated insurance proceeds, in the first half of 2008. For more information regarding the litigation related to our historical stock option granting practices, please see Legal Proceedings above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 41 Table of Contents Verestar. As discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, in October 2007, we finalized a settlement agreement related to the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation of our Verestar subsidiary, pursuant to which we agreed to pay $32.0 million and the parties agreed to a mutual release of all claims existing prior to the execution of the settlement agreement. In November 2007, following approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the settlement agreement became effective, and the litigation was dismissed. We paid the $32.0 million settlement amount in November 2007 and are in discussions with our insurers concerning the amount of their contribution to the settlement. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 issued in the Securitization, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 825,000 825,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 288 288 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes $ 59,683 59,683 3.25% convertible notes 18,333 18,333 3.00% convertible notes 344,979 344,979 2.25% convertible notes $ 42 42 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 42 $ 78,016 $ 288 $ 1,894,979 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,223,325 Cash interest expense(1) 246,000 246,000 243,000 243,000 194,000 290,000 1,462,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,996 5,448 4,961 24,166 3,416 193,193 237,180 Total debt service obligations $ 252,038 $ 251,448 $ 325,977 $ 267,454 $ 2,092,395 $ 2,733,193 $ 5,922,505 Operating lease payments(2) 217,969 215,763 208,548 199,024 190,272 2,451,496 3,483,072 Other long term liabilities(3)(4) 155 172 177 182 187 189,290 190,163 Total $ 470,162 $ 467,383 $ 534,702 $ 466,660 $ 2,282,854 $ 5,373,979 $ 9,595,740 (1) For more information regarding the Revolving Credit Facility, see Sources of Cash below. Interest rates for the Revolving Credit Facility are determined at our option and range between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and 42 Table of Contents Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility, is 4.83% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. (2) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (3) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (4) Other long term liabilities exclude $29.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $30.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. As discussed in notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 which resulted in the classification of uncertain tax positions as non current income tax liabilities. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived primarily from distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. Under the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures for our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and 7.00% Notes, our subsidiaries are classified as either restricted subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries. With regard to the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes (which generally contain more restrictions than the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility or the indenture for our 7.00% Notes), most of our operating subsidiaries other than SpectraSite are designated as restricted subsidiaries. This means, among other things, that those subsidiaries, like American Tower Corporation itself, are subject to those indentures restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group. In addition, while SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are classified as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, certain of SpectraSites subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the Securitization, as discussed below. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $444.4 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $33.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $411.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our cash provided by operating activities was $692.7 million, $620.7 million and $397.2 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes approximately $80.0 million received in connection with our federal income tax refund, as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 43 Table of Contents herein, as well as a reduction of approximately $49.8 million of net cash receipts related to towers included in the Securitization, which are classified as restricted cash, and a reduction of $32.0 million related to the payment of the Verestar settlement amount. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2008 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See Results of Operations above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures, tower acquisitions and repurchases of our Class A common stock. Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2007, we refinanced our existing $1.6 billion AMT OpCo senior secured credit facilities with the new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility. We borrowed $1.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility and together with cash on hand, used the funds to repay all amounts outstanding under the existing AMT OpCo credit facilities plus accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we drew down and repaid amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course, and also repaid $450.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility using net proceeds from our Term Loan, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2007, we had the ability to borrow approximately $411.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 29, 2008, we had drawn down an additional $150.0 million, and reduced our undrawn letters of credit to $11.9 million. Accordingly, as of February 29, 2008, we had the ability to borrow approximately $263.1 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). For more information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility, please see Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Term Loan Credit Facility. In August 2007, we entered into a new $500.0 million Term Loan. In connection with that transaction, we received $498.5 million of net proceeds from the Term Loan, which we used to repay $450.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. In October 2007, we completed an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes, as discussed below, and used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan in accordance with the mandatory prepayment requirement. We terminated the Term Loan upon repayment. For more information regarding the Term Loan, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Previous Credit Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also maintained two credit facilities at our principal operating subsidiaries, the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities. We repaid and terminated the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities in May and June 2007, respectively. For more information regarding the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 44 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we received an aggregate of approximately $124.1 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. Proceeds from the Sale of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received $22.2 million in aggregate net proceeds related to sales of non core assets, including $5.1 million from sales of tower assets and buildings and $17.1 million from sales of short term available for sale securities. Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt Securitization. In May 2007, we completed the Securitization involving assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers (the Towers) owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 (the Certificates). The Certificates were issued by American Tower Trust I (the Trust), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the Depositor), one of our indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries. The assets of the Trust consist of a recourse loan (the Loan) initially made by the Depositor to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the Borrowers), pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement among the foregoing parties dated as of May 4, 2007 (the Loan Agreement). The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Towers subject to the Securitization. As indicated in the table below, the Certificates were issued in seven separate classes. Each of the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E and Class F Certificates are subordinated in right of payment to any other class of Certificates which has an earlier alphabetical designation. The Certificates were issued with terms identical to the Loan except for the Class A FL Certificates, which bear interest at a floating rate while the related component of the Loan bears interest at a fixed rate, as described below. The various classes of Certificates were issued with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.61%. The Certificates have an expected life of approximately seven years with a final repayment date in April 2037.

Holders of the Class A FL Certificates have the benefit of an interest rate swap agreement between the Trust and Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Neither we nor the Borrowers have any obligations or liability with respect to this interest rate swap agreement. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay all amounts outstanding under the SpectraSite credit facilities, including approximately $765.0 million in principal, plus accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto, as well as to repay approximately $250.0 million drawn under the revolving loan component of the AMT OpCo credit facilities. An additional $349.5 million of the proceeds was used to fund our 45 Table of Contents tender offer and consent solicitation for our ATI 7.25% Notes, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. We also funded $14.3 million in cash reserve accounts with proceeds from the Securitization as required under the Loan Agreement. The Loan will be paid by the Borrowers solely from the cash flows generated by the Towers. These funds in turn will be used by or on behalf of the Trust to service the payment of interest on the Certificates and for any other payments required by the Loan Agreement. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan. Subject to certain limited exceptions, no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to the anticipated repayment date for the Loan in April 2014. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the Towers are released to the Borrowers, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. The Borrowers may not prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time prior to May 2009, except in limited circumstances, including the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to the Towers and certain dispositions of Towers. Thereafter, prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within nine months of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the Loan components will be due in April 2037. The Loan may be defeased in whole or in part at any time. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Towers and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers personal property and fixtures and (3) the Borrowers rights under the Management Agreement dated as of May 4, 2007 with SpectraSite, as manager. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of the Securitization, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of us or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for debt service payments, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums and management fees, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received each month are restricted and held by the Trustee. The $53.7 million held in the reserve accounts as of December 31, 2007 is classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. For more information regarding the Securitization, please see Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 7.00% Senior Notes Offering. In October 2007, we completed an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $493.5 million, which we used, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under our $500.0 million Term Loan. We terminated the Term Loan upon repayment. The 7.00% Notes mature on October 15, 2017, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2008, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding April 1 and October 1, respectively. We may redeem the 7.00% Notes at any time. The redemption price on the 7.00% Notes is 100% of the principal amount, plus a make whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of issuance and will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. 46 Table of Contents If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline, each as defined in the indenture for the 7.00% Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 7.00% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional interest, if any, to but not including the date of repurchase. The 7.00% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more subsidiary debt or permit subsidiaries to provide guarantees; create liens; and merge, consolidate or sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that our restricted subsidiaries may incur certain indebtedness, and that we and our subsidiaries may incur liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such indebtedness and such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the indenture. For more information regarding the 7.00% Notes, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued an aggregate of 7,324,760 shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $3.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the date of conversion and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2007, $18.3 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. 5.0% Convertible Notes Tender Offer. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes. The tender offer was intended to satisfy the rights granted to each noteholder under the indenture for the 5.0% Notes to require us to repurchase on February 20, 2007 all or any part of such holders 5.0% Notes at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding February 20, 2007. Under the terms of the 5.0% Notes, we had the option to pay for the 5.0% Notes with cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and stock. We elected to pay for the 5.0% Notes solely with cash. Pursuant to the tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer and as of December 31, 2007, $59.7 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 7.25% Notes Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation. In April 2007, we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation with respect to our outstanding ATI 7.25% Notes. In May 2007, we received tenders and consents of approximately 99.9% or $324.8 million of the $325.1 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes outstanding, and elected to accept for payment all ATI 7.25% Notes that had been properly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the related consents. Accordingly, we paid $349.5 million, including approximately $10.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to holders of ATI 7.25% Notes using net proceeds from the Securitization discussed above. In connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation, we entered into a supplemental indenture effecting certain amendments to the indenture for the notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to eliminate or modify related provisions. As of December 31, 2007, $0.3 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received cash of approximately $20.1 million upon net settlement of certain of our assets and liabilities under interest rate swap agreements held as of December 31, 2006 and entered into during the first half of 2007, as discussed below. In addition, we paid $8.0 million related to a treasury rate lock agreement entered into and settled during the three months ended September 30, 2007, as discussed below. We received $3.1 million in cash upon settlement of the assets and liabilities under ten forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.4 billion, which were designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the Certificates issued in the Securitization in 47 Table of Contents May 2007. As a result, the settlement gain of $2.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $1.1 million, is being recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the five year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges. We also received $17.0 million in cash upon settlement of our assets and liabilities under 13 additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $850.0 million that managed exposure to variability of interest rates under the SpectraSite credit facilities and AMT OpCo credit facilities. We recognized a net gain on these terminations of $8.1 million, which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. We paid $8.0 million in cash upon settlement of a treasury rate lock agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million entered into in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt. We terminated this treasury rate lock agreement during the year ended December 31, 2007 in connection with the pricing of our 7.00% Notes and are recognizing the settlement amount, net of tax as an increase in interest expense over the 10 year term of the 7.00% Notes. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2007 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Revolving Credit Facility. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens, as well as the following three financial maintenance tests: a consolidated total leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00; a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to our Securitization. The loan agreement related to our Securitization includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular 48 Table of Contents financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the Securitization could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers, and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us. If the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. With the exception of SpectraSite and its subsidiaries, most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures. In addition, certain of SpectraSites subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the Securitization, as discussed above. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. The indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. If a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the Securitization, the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility or the indentures for our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2007, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $252.0 million, $251.4 million, $326.0 million, $267.5 million, $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the Securitization permit certain of SpectraSites subsidiaries to make distributions to us, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption Risk Factors. In addition, our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or, if such financings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. 49 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, asset retirement obligations, stock based compensation, impairment of assets, revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2007. Of the critical accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006, we no longer consider the purchase price allocation as a critical accounting policy or estimate, as the SpectraSite purchase price allocation was finalized in June 2006. As discussed below, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007, which requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Accordingly, we have added additional considerations related to FIN 48 and our state deferred tax valuation allowances in our critical accounting policy related to income taxes, as noted in the following paragraphs. In addition, we have added estimated useful lives of assets as a critical accounting policy for the year ended December 31, 2007. Except for the deletion of the purchase price allocation, adoption of FIN 48 and changes in our deferred state tax valuation allowances, and the addition of estimated useful lives of assets during the year ended December 31, 2007, we have not made any changes to the policies in place at December 31, 2006. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F 8. Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. The cumulative effect of applying this interpretation was recorded as an increase of $25.8 million to accumulated deficit, an increase of $9.2 million to prepaid and other current assets and an increase of $17.1 million to long term deferred tax assets, with a corresponding increase in other long term liabilities of $52.1 million in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2007. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. If the tax 50 Table of Contents liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions and have classified approximately $29.6 million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. We also classified approximately $30.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. SFAS No. 109 Accounting For Income Taxes, requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed an analysis of the valuation allowances on our state deferred tax assets. We undertook this analysis as a result of several factors, including the fact that we had experienced several successive quarters of net income, we had restructured certain of our legal entities (primarily related to the Securitization), and we had completed a number of capital raising and debt refinancing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2007. We had previously recorded a full valuation allowance on our net state deferred tax assets, as we considered that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. However, upon completion of our analysis during the year ended December 31, 2007, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of these net state deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, we recognized approximately $27.6 million of additional state deferred tax assets (net of a federal tax provision), which were recorded as an income tax benefit and a corresponding increase in long term deferred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007. We will continue to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2007, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $88.2 million, including approximately $33.3 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital losses and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. Approximately $12.7 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowances as of December 31, 2007 will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized. In April 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset when we received a federal income tax refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses, as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 51 Table of Contents The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2027. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal tax refund claims as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2007. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. We will record any income tax benefit for these potential deductions when the plan of liquidation is finalized and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $3.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The primary reasons for the decrease in 2007 was a result of changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions, and the purchase of land underlying ground leases. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we also adopted the provisions of FIN 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement 52 Table of Contents obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Stock Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R supersedes the Companys previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Under SFAS No. 123R, we are no longer permitted to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25 described below. Instead, we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method, pursuant to which compensation expense for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Under APB No. 25, the Company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FAS 123R 3). Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No.123R. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we elected the Long method, as defined in the FAS 123R 3. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS No. 109 and EITF Topic D 32, Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations, we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us. We measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. 53 Table of Contents Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority, the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred. Generally, this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or, if grant authority has been delegated to management, when the shares are allocated to specific individuals. The stock based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method, whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting. The actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our historical stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense required under SFAS No. 123. As a result, we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after July 1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). We made this change based on a number of factors, including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non core businesses, reduce leverage and our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. We had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future. Our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans. Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non Core Long Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2007 and 2006 annual impairment testing included approximately $1.6 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are 54 Table of Contents received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximated $69.7 million, $58.3 million and $30.3 million, respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. Estimated Useful Lives of Assets. As described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets. We now have over ten years of operating history, and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review, and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of 2008, which we are in the process of analyzing. We currently depreciate towers on leased land on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) or the estimated useful life of the tower, which we have historically estimated to be 15 years. Additionally, certain of our intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis as our tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangibles correlate to the useful life of the towers. If we conclude a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate, we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change. Based on preliminary information obtained to date, we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization, and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, expands disclosures about fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement requires quantitative disclosures about fair value measurements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis during a period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008; however in February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that defers the effective date to January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). SFAS No. 157 is still effective for us on January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position, but it is likely that we will be required to provide additional disclosures in financial statements issued after the effective date. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position, but it is likely that we will be required to provide additional disclosures in financial statements issued after the effective date. 55 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for acquisitions specifically eliminating the step acquisition model, changes the recognition of contingent consideration from being recognized when it is probable to being recognized at the time of acquisition, disallows the capitalization of transaction costs, changes when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized and also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will have on acquisitions that are made after the effective date in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. The indentures governing our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. In order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2007, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 3.6. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity. Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow are considered non GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for these notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. 56 Table of Contents The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2007 $ 177,724 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ 668,123 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 (683,200 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2007 710,896 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ 695,819 Non Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ (48,012 ) 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all derivative financial instruments were used for purposes other than trading. During 2007, we terminated all swaps and caps that existed at December 31, 2006 and entered into three new interest rate swaps in November 2007. We also entered into and subsequently terminated a treasury lock agreement in connection with the pricing of our 7.00% Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased or converted $606.8 million face amount of notes for $545.8 million in cash, including the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes and $0.02 million principal amount of 3.00% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock, and the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid and terminated the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities in May 2007 and June 2007, respectively. In June 2007, we refinanced our existing $1.6 billion senior secured credit facilities at the AMT OpCo level with the new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2007, we entered into a new $500.0 million Term Loan, which was fully drawn in September 2007, and repaid and terminated in October 2007. As of December 31, 2007, $825.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2007, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the Securitization ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (2.25% Notes) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $502.2 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 3.25% Notes ($18.3 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $344.6 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.2 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 6.15%. As of December 31, 2006, variable rate debt consists of the SpectraSite credit facilities and AMT OpCo credit facilities ($1,725.0 million drawn) and fixed rate debt consists of: the 2.25% Notes ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2006 is $503.5 million); the 5.0% Notes ($252.2 million); the 3.25% Notes ($107.9 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($325.1 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2006 is $344.5 million accreted value) and other debt of $59.8 million. Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for our credit facilities was 5.30%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.92%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expire in December 2009. (c) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (d) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (e) Includes notional amount of $25.0 million that expired in September 2007. (f) Includes notional amounts of $300.0 million that were terminated in June 2007, prior to expiration in December 2009. (g) Includes notional amounts of $550.0 million that were terminated in June 2007, prior to expiration in October 2010. (h) Includes notional amounts of $900.0 million for forward starting interest rate swaps that were terminated in May 2007, prior to expiration in July 2012. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements (excluding $900.0 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2006) is comprised of $575.0 million and $875.0 million, respectively. A 10% increase, or approximately 53 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $3.0 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 59 Table of Contents In January and February 2008, we entered into an aggregate of five additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our Revolving Credit Facility. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million, fixed interest rates ranging from 2.92% to 3.74% and expire in 2011. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. We believe the exposure to the effects of foreign currency on our consolidated financial statements is limited as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
