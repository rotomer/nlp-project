ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning at page 45. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long term obligations, other income (expense), minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 97% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit in both years. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial non cancelable term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which has the effect of increasing the non cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect 27 Table of Contents on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our rental and management revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2008 was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2008, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, was approximately $95.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight line accounting treatment, and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2009. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. We constructed or acquired 961 and 462 sites in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year over year comparisons. During 2008, incremental revenue attributable to the approximately 1,420 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, was approximately $25.7 million. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2008 2007 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,547,035 $ 1,425,975 $ 121,060 8 % Network development services 46,469 30,619 15,850 52 Total revenues 1,593,504 1,456,594 136,910 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 363,024 343,450 19,574 6 Network development services 26,831 16,172 10,659 66 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 405,332 522,928 (117,596 ) (22 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $54,807 and $54,603 of stock based compensation expense, respectively) 180,374 186,483 (6,109 ) (3 ) Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense 11,189 9,198 1,991 22 Total operating expenses 986,750 1,078,231 (91,481 ) (8 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,489 and $1,490 14,253 14,207 46 Interest income 3,413 10,848 (7,435 ) (69 ) Interest expense (253,584 ) (235,824 ) 17,760 8 Loss on retirement of long term obligations (4,904 ) (35,429 ) (30,525 ) (86 ) Other income 5,988 20,675 (14,687 ) (71 ) Income tax provision (135,509 ) (59,809 ) 75,700 127 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (169 ) (338 ) (169 ) (50 ) Income on equity method investments 22 19 3 16 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net 110,982 (36,396 ) 147,378 405 Net income $ 347,246 $ 56,316 $ 290,930 517 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1,593.5 million, an increase of $136.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $121.1 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $15.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,547.0 million, an increase of $121.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $95.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, 29 Table of Contents existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight line accounting treatment, and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $25.7 million of the increase resulted from approximately 1,420 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2007. We believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $46.5 million, an increase of $15.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. As we continue to focus on and grow our rental and management business, however, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $986.8 million, a decrease of approximately $91.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and selling, general, administrative and development expense of $117.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $19.6 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $10.7 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $2.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $363.0 million, an increase of $19.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $10.4 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.2 million of the increase was related to approximately 1,420 sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2007. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2007 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,198.3 million, an increase of $101.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,130.2 million, an increase of $99.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This was comprised of the $101.5 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $2.2 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $26.8 million, an increase of $10.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 30 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $405.3 million, a decrease of $117.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to our revision of the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, partially offset by the depreciation, amortization and accretion expense associated with newly acquired and constructed towers. The change in the estimated useful lives of our towers was based on a review that we completed in the first quarter of 2008, the effect of which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $180.4 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $12.8 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs, partially offset by increases of approximately $6.7 million in expenses associated with international business development and information technology spending. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $11.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in losses recognized upon the disposal of certain non core tower assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average interest rates from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $253.6 million, an increase of $17.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 13% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, partially offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $30.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, holders of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender 31 Table of Contents offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 (5.0% Notes) and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (ATI 7.25% Notes). We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value of our 5.0% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes, amounts paid to holders of our 3.25% Notes in connection with their note conversions, and the write off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Financing Activities below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $14.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of foreign currency gains of $5.7 million. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of approximately $18.0 million of gains from the sale of available for sale securities and the mark to market and subsequent settlement of interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $135.5 million, as compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $75.7 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2008 as noted above. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign currency gains, the reversal of $6.4 million of valuation allowances related to our Mexican subsidiary and state taxes. These items are described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non deductible stock based compensation expense and additional tax reserves. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. In April 2007, we received a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest, substantially all of which was accrued at March 31, 2007. Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $111.0 million, as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (Verestar). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestars plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the 32 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $32.0 million liability associated with the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings equal to the settlement amount, which we paid in November 2007.

The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $7.3 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,426.0 million, an increase of $131.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $118.3 million of the increase resulted 33 Table of Contents from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight line accounting treatment, favorable currency exchange rates and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase resulted from approximately 790 communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $30.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services, related in part to our January 2007 acquisition of a structural analysis engineering firm, which enabled us to increase our structural analysis capabilities. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,078.2 million, an increase of $44.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $27.2 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $11.2 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $4.9 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $6.6 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $5.1 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $343.5 million, an increase of $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and approximately $3.7 million of the increase was related to approximately 790 sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2006 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,096.7 million, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,030.8 million, an increase of $115.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. This was comprised of the $120.7 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $4.8 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 34 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $522.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to the finalization in June 2006 of the purchase price allocation related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger, which resulted in decreases in the fair values of certain intangible assets and changes in the estimated useful lives of certain tangible and intangible assets. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $186.5 million, an increase of $27.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $15.1 million in stock based compensation expense and a decrease of $2.3 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. Stock based compensation expense included $7.6 million related to the modification of certain stock option awards for two members of senior management who terminated their employment during the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining $14.4 million net increase was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation expenses other than stock based compensation expense, primarily related to administrative, information technology and business development activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $9.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest earning cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $235.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 9% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities undertaken during the period. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. 35 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $20.7 million, an increase of $14.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $5.5 million of gains recognized on the sale of our common stock investment in FiberTower Corporation and an increase of $6.2 million in gains recognized from the mark to market and subsequent settlement of certain interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $59.8 million, as compared to $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase of $18.0 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of $27.6 million of valuation allowances on net state deferred tax assets offset by a $7.6 million deferred tax liability recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2007 related to unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans with our Brazilian subsidiary. These items are described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non deductible stock based compensation expense, additional tax reserves and state taxes. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to foreign items, non deductible losses on conversions of our 3.25% Notes and state taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we also received a federal income tax refund from the IRS of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest. The refund resulted from claims by us filed with the IRS in June 2003 and October 2003, which related to the carry back of net operating losses. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods. The adjustments were identified in connection with our year end tax analyses and audit of the consolidated financial statements and relate primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities. Recording these out of period adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2007 had the effect of increasing the income tax provision by $7.9 million and decreasing income from continuing operations by approximately $4.8 million (inclusive of certain non tax related adjustments). Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net The loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $37.8 million of net losses related to Verestar and $1.4 million in net gains related to litigation and insurance settlements that were settled for less than the original estimates. 36 Table of Contents The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily due to the settlement of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation and the related tax effects. In November 2007, following approval by the bankruptcy court, the Verestar settlement agreement became effective, we paid the $32.0 million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed. In connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation, we determined that the benefits from certain of Verestars net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us. We had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of Verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved. Accordingly, in November 2007, we recorded $5.6 million of additional tax benefits related to Verestar. We also recorded a tax provision of $10.7 million in loss from discontinued operations, net during the three months ended December 31, 2007 to write off deferred tax assets associated with Verestar that should have been written off in 2002 and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when Verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $638.2 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $143.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $495.1 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $110.0 million as compared to December 31, 2007. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is set forth below. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 773,258 $ 692,679 $ 620,738 Investing activities (274,940 ) (186,180 ) (129,112 ) Financing activities (388,172 ) (754,640 ) (323,063 ) Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (192 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 109,954 $ (248,141 ) $ 168,563 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, tower construction and DAS network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also used a significant amount of our cash flows to fund refinancing and repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as our stock repurchase programs. By refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, we improved our financial position, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant transactions in 2008 included the following: We entered into a new $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to our Revolving Credit Facility and used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. We reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of approximately $201.1 million face amount of convertible notes into shares of our Common Stock. 37 Table of Contents We repurchased approximately 18.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $697.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2008, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.3 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2008. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2009 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2009. During 2009, if the financial and credit markets improve, we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $773.3 million, an increase of approximately $80.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations of $143.5 million resulting from continued growth in our rental and management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $692.7 million, an increase of approximately $71.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $28.8 million resulting from the continued growth of our rental and management segment and a decrease in prepaid and other assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in non cash items reflected in the statement of operations. The decrease in prepaid and other assets was primarily the result of a decrease in deferred tax assets. The decrease in non cash items was primarily a result of a reduction of approximately $49.8 million of net cash receipts related to towers included in the securitization transaction, which are classified as restricted cash. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2009 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008 cash used for investing activities was $274.9 million, an increase of approximately $88.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $89.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $243.5 million, including $105.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites, $90.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 in building DAS networks, $41.7 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $5.6 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we spent $42.8 million to acquire 269 towers. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our 2009 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $200.0 million and $230.0 million, including $45.0 million for capital improvements and corporate expenditures, 38 Table of Contents between $30.0 million and $35.0 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, between $25.0 million and $30.0 million of ground lease purchases and between $100.0 million and $120.0 million for the construction of approximately 700 to 900 new communications sites, including towers and DAS networks, and for the installation of shared back up power generators at certain of our tower sites. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash used for investing activities was $186.2 million, an increase of approximately $57.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $56.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $154.4 million, including $66.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites, $30.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 152 towers and the installation of 17 in building DAS networks, $44.4 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $12.7 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent $36.9 million to acquire 293 towers and $7.1 million to acquire the assets of a structural analysis engineering firm. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for financing activities was $388.2 million, a decrease of approximately $366.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $928.2 million in purchases of our Common Stock and a decrease of $44.7 million in deferred financing costs and other financing activities. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of any new debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the issuance of approximately $2,250.0 million in debt during the year ended December 31, 2007. Borrowings under our credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were approximately $575.0 million, as compared to $2,175.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The borrowings and debt issuances were offset by debt repayments of approximately $327.5 million and $3,612.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash used for financing activities was $754.6 million, an increase of approximately $431.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $3,316.5 million in repayments of notes payable, credit facilities and capital leases and an increase of $1,336.0 million in purchases of our Common Stock, partially offset by an increase of $4,183.0 million in the proceeds received as a result of the issuance of debt and drawdown on the existing credit facilities. Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we drew down and repaid amounts under the $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course, and we also repaid $325.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility using net proceeds from the Term Loan and available cash. As of December 31, 2008, we had $750.0 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $495.1 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is American Tower Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). 39 Table of Contents Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. At closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million from the Term Loan, which, together with available cash, we used to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. Consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrower under the Term Loan is American Tower Corporation, and the maturity date for the Term Loan is June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. Stock Repurchase Programs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we maintained two stock repurchase programs, a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2007 (2007 Buyback), which we ended in February 2008, and a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2008 (2008 Buyback), which remains ongoing. Pursuant to the 2007 Buyback we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $163.7 million, including commissions and fees, during the three months ended March 31, 2008. Total repurchases under the 2007 Buyback were approximately 35.3 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.45 billion, including commissions and fees. Pursuant to the 2008 Buyback, we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $533.3 million, including commissions and fees, during the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 71.1 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate of $2.7 billion, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our Common Stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the financial and credit markets improve, we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital, which we could then use to fund future purchases of our Common Stock. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the 2008 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we purchase our Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we significantly reduced purchases of Common Stock under our stock repurchase program based on the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately 28,000 shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $0.8 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of February 13, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 14.0 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $534.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the program in the future in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we received an aggregate of approximately $82.9 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 issued in our securitization transaction, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 750,000 750,000 Term Loan (1) 325,000 325,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 288 288 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes $ 59,683 59,683 3.00% convertible notes(2) 162,216 162,216 2.25% convertible notes $ 44 44 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 44 $ 59,683 $ 288 $ 1,962,216 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,272,231 Cash interest expense(1) 224,000 218,000 217,000 182,000 $ 133,000 158,000 1,132,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,772 5,469 4,972 4,812 4,829 206,570 232,424 Total debt service obligations $ 229,816 $ 283,152 $ 222,260 $ 2,149,028 $ 137,829 $ 2,614,570 $ 5,636,655 Operating lease payments(3) 229,799 222,063 217,771 212,871 207,771 2,859,415 3,949,690 Other long term liabilities(4)(5) 164 182 187 193 198 214,873 215,797 Total $ 459,779 $ 505,397 $ 440,218 $ 2,362,092 $ 345,798 $ 5,688,858 $ 9,802,142 (1) The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the 41 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 1.42% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. (2) We may redeem the 3.00% Notes after August 20, 2009 at an initial redemption price of 101.125% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after August 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2012. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (5) Other long term liabilities exclude $24.7 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $29.1 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Refinancing Activities In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into a $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, and we used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we sought to manage our exposure to variable interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan by entering into swap agreements, as discussed below. 3.25% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued approximately 1.5 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Common Stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In April 2008, we issued approximately 1.1 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $13.6 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In connection with the conversion, we paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. In July 2008, we issued a notice for the redemption on August 6, 2008 of all of our outstanding 3.25% Notes. In accordance with the conversion provisions of the 3.25% Notes and the indenture for the 3.25% Notes, holders of the notes had the right at any time until and including, but not after, the close of business on August 5, 2008, to convert their notes into shares of our Common Stock. Holders of all $4.7 million of the outstanding 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of approximately 0.4 million shares of our Common Stock prior to redemption. As a result, as of August 6, 2008, none of the 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. 42 Table of Contents 3.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 8.9 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, holders of the 3.00% Notes are entitled to receive 48.7805 shares of Common Stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversions, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $4.7 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2008, $162.2 million principal amount of the 3.00% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted interest payments under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens, as well as the following three financial maintenance tests: a consolidated total leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00; a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization Transaction. The loan agreement related to the securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special 43 Table of Contents purpose entities, including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization transaction, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers, and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us. If the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization transaction, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. With the exception of SpectraSite and its subsidiaries, most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures. This means, among other things, that those subsidiaries, like American Tower Corporation itself, are subject to those indentures restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group. In addition, certain of SpectraSites subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction, as discussed above. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. The indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. If a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction, the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan or the indentures for our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2008, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $229.8 million, $283.2 million, $222.3 million, $2.2 billion, $137.8 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction permit certain of SpectraSites subsidiaries to make distributions to us, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A 44 Table of Contents of this Annual Report under the caption Risk Factors. In addition, our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or, if such financings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable, particularly in light of the recent downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, asset retirement obligations, stock based compensation, impairment of assets, revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2008. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F 7. Income Taxes. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we have classified approximately $24.7 million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $29.1 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. SFAS No. 109 Accounting For Income Taxes, requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2008, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $47.4 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax 45 Table of Contents carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2028. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2008. As described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in April 2008, Verestars plan of liquidation was approved by the bankruptcy court and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2008. Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $13.0 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $3.8 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions, and the purchase of land underlying ground leases. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions 46 Table of Contents are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R) and related pronouncements, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non Core Long Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 approximated $50.4 million, $69.7 million and $58.3 million, respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or 47 Table of Contents received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. Estimated Useful Lives of Assets. As described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, during the year ended December 31, 2007 we undertook a review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets to determine if we should modify our estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of 2008. Based on this review, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, effective January 1, 2008. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million and an increase in net income of approximately $74.4 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 was effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We have not elected the fair value option allowed under SFAS No. 159. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. Among other items, SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for acquisitions by eliminating the step acquisition model, providing that contingent consideration be recognized at the time of acquisition (instead of being recognized when it is probable), disallowing the capitalization of transaction costs, and changing when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us for acquisitions made after the January 1, 2009 effective date. Amounts capitalized in notes receivable and other long term assets as of December 31, 2008, include approximately $1.6 million of transaction costs that will be expensed upon the adoption of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). Among other items, SFAS No. 160 establishes consolidating parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) 157 1 and 157 2. FSP 157 1 amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, (SFAS No. 13) and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions, while FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of the application to January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis (that is, at least annually). In October 2008, the FASB 48 Table of Contents issued FSP 157 3. FSP 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 when determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not currently active. FSP 157 3 emphasizes that approaches other than the market approach to determining fair value may be appropriate when it is determined that, as a result of market inactivity, other valuation approaches are more representative of fair value. Other valuation approaches can involve significant assumptions regarding future cash flows. FSP 157 3 clarifies that these assumptions must incorporate adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity risks that market participants would consider in valuing the asset in an inactive market. FSP 157 3 emphasizes the existing disclosure requirements under SFAS No. 157 regarding significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). FSP 157 3 became effective on October 10, 2008, including with respect to prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We did not elect to early adopt SFAS No. 157 for nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets or liabilities as allowed under FSP FAS 157 2. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). Among other items, this statement changes disclosure requirements and requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why entities use derivative financial instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities and related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will have on our disclosures; however, the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have an impact on the determination of our financial results. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. SFAS No. 162 is effective for us 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 162 will have on our consolidated results of operation and financial position. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. The indentures governing our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. In order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2008, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 3.5. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity. 49 Table of Contents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow are considered non GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for these notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2008 $ 188,449 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 726,954 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 (741,565 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2008 753,798 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 739,187 Non Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 $ (14,611 ) 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2008, all derivative financial instruments were used for purposes other than trading. During 2008, we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements and as of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of $201.1 million principal amount of our convertible notes converted their notes, including the conversion of $18.3 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of 3.00% Notes into shares of our Common Stock. In March 2008, we entered into a new $325.0 million Term Loan, of which approximately $321.7 million was used, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, $750.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2008, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the securitization transaction ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (2.25% Notes) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $501.1 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($162.2 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $161.9 million accreted value); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 (7.00 Notes) ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.1 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 4.16%. As of December 31, 2007, variable rate debt consists of our Revolving Credit Facility ($825.0 million drawn) included above based on the June 8, 2012 maturity date. As of December 31, 2007, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the securitization transaction ($1.75 billion); 2.25% Notes ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $502.2 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 3.25% Notes ($18.3 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $344.6 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.2 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 6.15%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expire in December 2009. (c) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (d) Includes notional amounts of $175.0 million, $75.0 million and $275.0 million that expire in January, February, and March 2011, respectively. (e) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2008, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $250.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase, or approximately 32 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico, Brazil and India. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $6.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $5.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. 52 Table of Contents
