ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning at page 45. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long term obligations, other income (expense), noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues, and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (legacy sites), new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (new sites), our existing tenant leases and related contractual escalations, leasing of additional space on our existing sites and the cancellation rate of our existing tenant leases. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing site capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services. As we continue to primarily focus on growing our rental and management business, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non cancelable term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalations are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which increases the non cancelable term of the agreement and creates incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment may also be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters 27 Table of Contents are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, tenant leases representing approximately 2% of our rental and management revenues were cancelled. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenues generated by our rental and management segment increased $121.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated by our legacy sites which resulted from leasing additional space to new tenants, leasing additional space for the equipment of our existing tenants, as well as contractual tenant lease escalations. To a lesser extent, a portion of our revenue growth was attributable to the 4,511 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2008. The increase in revenue was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straight line revenue recognition. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites and expanding our site portfolio will contribute to the majority of our year over year revenue growth in 2010. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our legacy sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. In geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint, we may incur additional segment level selling, general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,668,420 $ 1,547,035 $ 121,385 8 % Network development services 55,694 46,469 9,225 20 Total revenues 1,724,114 1,593,504 130,610 8 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 383,990 363,024 20,966 6 Network development services 32,385 26,831 5,554 21 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 414,619 405,332 9,287 2 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including stock based compensation expense of $60,670 and $54,807, respectively) 201,694 180,374 21,320 12 Other operating expenses 19,168 11,189 7,979 71 Total operating expenses 1,051,856 986,750 65,106 7 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND OTHER ITEMS: Interest income, TV Azteca, net 14,210 14,253 (43 ) Interest income 1,722 3,413 (1,691 ) (50 ) Interest expense (249,803 ) (253,584 ) (3,781 ) (1 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations (18,194 ) (4,904 ) 13,290 271 Other income 1,294 5,988 (4,694 ) (78 ) Income tax provision (182,565 ) (135,509 ) 47,056 35 Income on equity method investments 26 22 4 18 Income from continuing operations 238,948 236,433 2,515 1 Income from discontinued operations, net 8,179 110,982 (102,803 ) (93 ) Net income 247,127 347,415 (100,288 ) (29 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (532 ) (169 ) 363 215 Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation $ 246,595 $ 347,246 $ (100,651 ) (29 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1,724.1 million, an increase of $130.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Approximately $121.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue, with the remaining portion of the increase attributable to network development services revenue. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,668.4 million, an increase of $121.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Legacy sites contributed $73.4 million of the increase, which was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites and contractual tenant lease escalations, partially offset by 29 Table of Contents tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straight line revenue recognition. Approximately $48.0 million of the increase resulted from the 4,511 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2008. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $55.7 million, an increase of $9.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our expanding site acquisition, zoning, permitting and installation services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1,051.9 million, an increase of $65.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $21.3 million, increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $21.0 million and network development services segment of $5.6 million, an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses of $9.3 million, and an increase in other operating expenses of $8.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $384.0 million, an increase of $21.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Increases in rental and management expenses of our legacy sites, consisting primarily of contractual ground lease escalations and inflationary increases, were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, the $21.0 million was attributable to the new sites added since January 1, 2008. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,298.6 million, an increase of $100.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily resulted from additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by an increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,212.5 million, an increase of $82.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was comprised of the $100.4 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, partially offset by an increase of approximately $18.1 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to our rental and management segment, due in large part to our international expansion. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $32.4 million, an increase of $5.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $414.6 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of 3,550 sites during 2009, which resulted in an increase in property, plant and equipment. 30 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $201.7 million, an increase of $21.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $5.9 million in stock based compensation expense, which was principally driven by the additional expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $5.9 million of bad debt expense, an increase of $5.4 million for the write off of capitalized costs related to discontinued projects and an increase in the cost to support our growth in international geographic areas. For the year ended December 31, 2008, selling, general, administrative and development expense included a one time reduction related to payroll tax expense of approximately $3.1 million. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $19.2 million, an increase of $8.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $6.3 million in acquisition related costs which have been expensed as a result of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Approximately $1.2 million of these costs are related to the expensing of amounts which had been recorded as other long term assets at December 31, 2008 for pending acquisitions and the remaining $5.1 million relates to additional acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in impairments and losses on the sale of assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $249.8 million, a decrease of $3.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average outstanding debt of approximately $107.8 million. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $18.2 million, an increase of $13.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent redemption, we repurchased and redeemed an aggregate of $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% Notes for an aggregate purchase price of $231.7 million, including accrued and unpaid interest, and we repurchased an aggregate of $500.0 million principal amount of 7.125% Notes for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $18.2 million related to the amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write off of the related deferred financing fees, discounts and premiums. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (3.25% Notes) and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Financing Activities below. 31 Table of Contents Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $1.3 million, as compared to other income of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, other income of $1.3 million consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $1.7 million on the settlement of a foreign currency exchange contract executed to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL, partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement losses of approximately $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded foreign currency remeasurement gains of approximately $5.7 million. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $182.6 million, an increase of $47.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate was 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to an effective tax rate of 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, is primarily due to the discrete impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain tax items, IRS audit adjustments and certain valuation allowances, partially offset by the decrease in tax reserves. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2009 as noted above. The effective tax rates on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non deductible stock based compensation expense, IRS audit adjustments of approximately $10.0 million, tax reserves and state taxes. As we continue to evaluate our organizational structure in light of our expansion within Latin America, we anticipate that the implementation of certain restructuring activities could have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2010. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $8.2 million, a decrease of $102.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to the recording of an income tax benefit of $110.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (Verestar). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestars plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. The $102.8 million decrease was partially offset by an insurance reimbursement received during the year ended December 31, 2009 for approximately $5.0 million related to the Verestar bankruptcy settlement. 32 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2008 2007 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,547,035 $ 1,425,975 $ 121,060 8 % Network development services 46,469 30,619 15,850 52 Total revenues 1,593,504 1,456,594 136,910 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 363,024 343,450 19,574 6 Network development services 26,831 16,172 10,659 66 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 405,332 522,928 (117,596 ) (22 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including stock based compensation expense of $54,807 and $54,603, respectively) 180,374 186,483 (6,109 ) (3 ) Other operating expenses 11,189 9,198 1,991 22 Total operating expenses 986,750 1,078,231 (91,481 ) (8 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND OTHER ITEMS: Interest income, TV Azteca, net 14,253 14,207 46 Interest income 3,413 10,848 (7,435 ) (69 ) Interest expense (253,584 ) (235,824 ) 17,760 8 Loss on retirement of long term obligations (4,904 ) (35,429 ) (30,525 ) (86 ) Other income 5,988 20,675 (14,687 ) (71 ) Income tax provision (135,509 ) (59,809 ) 75,700 127 Income on equity method investments 22 19 3 16 Income from continuing operations 236,433 93,050 143,383 154 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net 110,982 (36,396 ) 147,378 405 Net income 347,415 56,654 290,761 513 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (169 ) (338 ) (169 ) (50 ) Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation $ 347,246 $ 56,316 $ 290,930 517 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1,593.5 million, an increase of $136.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $121.1 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $15.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,547.0 million, an increase of $121.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Legacy sites contributed approximately $95.4 million of the increase, which was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites and contractual tenant lease escalations, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as a reduction in straight line revenue recognition. Approximately $25.7 million of the increase resulted from the 1,420 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2007. 33 Table of Contents Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $46.5 million, an increase of $15.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition, zoning, permitting and installation services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $986.8 million, a decrease of approximately $91.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and selling, general, administrative and development expense of $117.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $19.6 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $10.7 million and an increase in other operating expense of $2.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $363.0 million, an increase of $19.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $10.4 million of the increase was attributable to legacy sites and was primarily related to increases due to contractual ground lease escalations. The remaining $9.2 million of the increase was attributable to the new sites added since January 1, 2007. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,198.3 million, an increase of $101.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,130.2 million, an increase of $99.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This was comprised of the $101.5 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $2.2 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $26.8 million, an increase of $10.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $405.3 million, a decrease of $117.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to our revision of the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, partially offset by the depreciation, amortization and accretion expense associated with the acquisition or construction of 961 sites during 2008. The change in the estimated useful lives of our towers was based on a review that we completed in the first quarter of 2008, the effect of which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $180.4 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily 34 Table of Contents attributable to a decrease of approximately $12.8 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs, partially offset by increases of approximately $6.7 million in expenses associated with international business development and information technology spending. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $11.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in losses recognized upon the disposal of certain non core tower assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average interest rates from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $253.6 million, an increase of $17.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 13% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below, partially offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate. Loss on Retirement of Long Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $30.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, holders of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 (5.0% Notes) and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (ATI 7.25% Notes). We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value of our 5.0% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes, amounts paid to holders of our 3.25% Notes in connection with their note conversions, and the write off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Financing Activities below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $14.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of 35 Table of Contents foreign currency gains of $5.7 million. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of approximately $18.0 million of gains from the sale of available for sale securities and the mark to market and subsequent settlement of interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $135.5 million, as compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $75.7 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2008 as noted above. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign currency gains, the reversal of $6.4 million of valuation allowances related to our Mexican subsidiary and state taxes. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non deductible stock based compensation expense and additional tax reserves. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. In April 2007, we received a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest, substantially all of which was accrued at March 31, 2007. Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $111.0 million, as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar. We recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $32.0 million liability associated with the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings equal to the settlement amount, which we paid in November 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $943.1 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $247.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $695.8 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $104.2 million as compared to December 31, 2008. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is set forth below. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 842,126 $ 773,258 $ 692,679 Investing activities (543,066 ) (274,940 ) (186,180 ) Financing activities (194,942 ) (388,172 ) (754,640 ) Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 98 (192 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 104,216 $ 109,954 $ (248,141 ) 36 Table of Contents We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, tower construction and DAS network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we also used a significant amount of our cash flows to fund refinancing and repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as our stock repurchase program. By refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, we improved our financial position, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant financing transactions in 2009 included the following: We extended the maturity dates and lowered the cost of our debt by completing two institutional private placements of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Notes and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Notes. We reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our senior and convertible notes through repurchases or redemptions of $725.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. We repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $214.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.2 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2009. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2010 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2010. For more information regarding our financing transactions in 2009, see Cash Flows from Financing Activities below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $842.1 million, an increase of $68.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily comprised of an increase of $84.5 million in the operating profit of our operating segments, partially offset by an increase in the amount spent to meet working capital needs. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $773.3 million, an increase of approximately $80.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $103.9 million in the operating profit of our operating segments, partially offset by an increase in the amount spent to meet working capital needs. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2010 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used for investing activities was $543.1 million, an increase of approximately $268.1 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily comprised of increased spending for acquisitions, property and equipment and construction activities during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $250.3 million, including $63.8 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and redevelopment of our existing communications sites, $129.9 million spent in 37 Table of Contents connection with the construction of 1,024 towers, the installation of 21 in building DAS networks and the installation of shared back up power generators, $49.1 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $7.5 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we spent $98.0 million, net of $6.0 million cash acquired, to acquire XCEL, $19.9 million, net of $0.2 million cash acquired, to acquire Insight, and $183.9 million to acquire 522 additional towers. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately $300 million and $350 million in 2010, with spending for capital improvements, corporate expenditures and the redevelopment of existing communications sites at levels comparable to 2009. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $50 million for ground lease purchases and $165 million to $205 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new communications sites. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for investing activities was $274.9 million, an increase of approximately $88.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $89.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $243.5 million, including $105.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and redevelopment of our existing communications sites, $90.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 in building DAS networks, $41.7 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $5.6 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we spent $42.8 million to acquire 269 towers. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used for financing activities was $194.9 million, as compared to cash used for financing activities of approximately $388.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The cash used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily related to the tender offer and subsequent redemption of the 7.50% Notes, the redemption of the 7.125% Notes, the repayment of credit facilities and capital leases of approximately $931.2 million and payments for the repurchase of our Common Stock of $213.3 million, which consisted primarily of stock repurchases under our 2008 Buyback; partially offset by $900.0 million ($884.1 million, net of commissions and expenses) of proceeds from the issuance of the 7.25% Notes and the 4.625% Notes and approximately $66.0 million of proceeds from stock options, warrants and the employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for financing activities was $388.2 million, a decrease of approximately $366.5 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $928.2 million in purchases of our Common Stock and a decrease of $44.7 million in deferred financing costs and other financing activities. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of any new debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the issuance of approximately $2,250.0 million in debt during the year ended December 31, 2007. Borrowings under our credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were approximately $575.0 million, as compared to $2,175.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The borrowings and debt issuances were offset by debt repayments of approximately $327.5 million and $3,612.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had $550.0 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $695.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 38 Table of Contents The borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is American Tower Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for our and our subsidiaries working capital needs and other general corporate purposes (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. At closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million from the Term Loan, which, together with available cash, we used to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. Consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrower under the Term Loan is American Tower Corporation, and the maturity date for the Term Loan is June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. XCEL Credit Facility. At the time of our acquisition of XCEL, a 4.8 billion Indian Rupee denominated credit facility (XCEL Credit Facility) was in place, of which 3.4 billion Indian Rupees was outstanding. The borrower under the XCEL Credit Facility is XCEL. The XCEL Credit Facility has a term of four years and matures on March 31, 2016. Interest is payable monthly and accrues at an initial rate of 13.25% per year. In March 2010, the initial interest rate will be adjusted based upon the benchmark rate of interest of each lender. The XCEL Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for construction and acquisition of communications sites and is secured by a first mortgage on all movable and immovable fixed assets of XCEL and a pledge of certain equity interests of XCEL. Senior Notes Offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed institutional private placements of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Notes and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Notes. The net proceeds from the 7.25% Notes offering were approximately $290.2 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $210.2 million of the net proceeds to finance the repurchase through a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our outstanding 7.50% Notes. In addition, we used $50.0 million of the net proceeds to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness incurred under our Revolving Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the 4.625% Notes offering were approximately $593.9 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $511.7 million of the net proceeds to finance the redemption of our outstanding 7.125% Notes. The remainder of the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The 7.25% Notes mature on May 15, 2019, and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2009, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding May 1 and November 1, respectively. We may redeem the 7.25% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from June 10, 2009 and will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. The 4.625% Notes will mature on April 1, 2015, and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2010, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding March 15 and September 15, respectively. We may redeem the 4.625% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from October 20, 2009 and will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. 39 Table of Contents If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline (in the event that on, or within 90 days after, an announcement of a change of control, both of our current investment grade credit ratings cease to be investment grade), each as defined in the indenture for the 7.25% Notes and 4.625% Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 7.25% Notes or 4.625% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional interest, if any, up to but not including the date of repurchase. The 7.25% Notes and 4.625% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in each indenture. Stock Repurchase Program. In 2009, we continued to repurchase shares of our Common Stock pursuant to our 2008 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $214.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of December 31, 2009, we had repurchased 20.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $748.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our Common Stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the 2008 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we purchase our Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $33.5 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of February 12, 2010, we had repurchased a total of 21.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $781.6 million, including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $718.4 million under the 2008 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we received an aggregate of $66.0 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 issued in our Securitization, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 550,000 550,000 Term Loan(1) 325,000 325,000 XCEL credit facility $ 9,171 $ 13,953 11,822 $ 11,822 $ 11,822 14,777 73,367 7.25% senior subordinated notes 288 288 7.25% senior notes 300,000 300,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 4.625% senior notes 600,000 600,000 5.0% convertible notes(2) 59,683 59,683 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 68,854 $ 14,241 $ 886,822 $ 11,822 $ 1,761,822 $ 1,414,777 $ 4,158,338 Cash interest expense(1) 223,000 202,000 192,000 188,000 112,000 204,000 1,121,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,744 5,482 4,898 4,755 4,800 198,182 223,861 Total debt service obligations $ 297,598 $ 221,723 $ 1,083,720 $ 204,577 $ 1,878,622 $ 1,816,959 $ 5,503,199 Operating lease payments(3) 258,427 251,553 243,457 237,828 233,483 2,814,908 4,039,656 Purchase obligations(4) 18,000 18,000 Other long term liabilities(5)(6) 583 611 626 642 651 872,393 875,506 Total $ 574,608 $ 473,887 $ 1,327,803 $ 443,047 $ 2,112,756 $ 5,504,260 $ 10,436,361 (1) The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 2.84%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 0.25% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. 41 Table of Contents (2) Our 5.0% convertible notes matured on February 15, 2010. We used cash on hand to repay the full amount outstanding. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement, we are obligated to acquire 114 towers in Brazil, pending regulatory approvals, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.0 million. If regulatory approvals are not obtained by June 30, 2010, the definitive purchase agreement expires, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties. (5) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (6) Other long term liabilities exclude $16.5 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $15.2 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Refinancing Activities In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. Tender Offer for and Redemption of 7.50% Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased $204.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes pursuant to a cash tender offer. We paid $210.2 million, including approximately $1.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to holders of the 7.50% Notes using net proceeds from the institutional private placement of the 7.25% Notes discussed above. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we completed the redemption of the remaining $20.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 7.50% Notes, the remaining 7.50% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, July 20, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $21.5 million, including accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $0.3 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 7.50% Notes remained outstanding. Redemption of 3.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining $162.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. In accordance with the conversion provisions and the indenture for the 3.00% Notes, holders of the 3.00% Notes had the right at any time up to and including, but not after the close of business on August 26, 2009, to convert their 3.00% Notes into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion rate of 48.7805 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes. Holders of approximately $162.1 million of the 3.00% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 7,908,316 shares of Common Stock prior to redemption. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 3.00% Notes, the remaining 3.00% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, August 27, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $0.1 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 3.00% Notes remained outstanding. 42 Table of Contents Redemption of 7.125% Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued a notice for the redemption of the principal amount of our outstanding 7.125% Notes. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 7.125% Notes, the 7.125% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.781% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, November 13, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million, including approximately $2.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 7.125% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we could incur approximately $2.74 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $456 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we could incur approximately $1.69 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $562 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our interest expense, which was $238 million for that period, could increase by approximately $225 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $563 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. 43 Table of Contents The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization. The loan agreement related to the Securitization involved assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the Borrowers), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 (the Certificates). The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $447.4 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (DSCR). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were: 1.30x or less, during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or 1.75x or less, thereafter, (1.30x or 1.75x as applicable, the Cash Trap DSCR), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 44 Table of Contents Additionally, while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the Securitization loan until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an Amortization Period under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An Amortization Period would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below: 1.15x, during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or 1.45x thereafter (1.15x or 1.45x as applicable, the Minimum DSCR). In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, and our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2009, the Borrowers DSCR was 3.10x. Based on the Borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $177.5 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $192.3 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. As also set forth in that Item, as of December 31, 2009, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have primarily caused a subsidiary of Grupo Iusacell, which represented approximately 5% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, to suspend debt service payments on its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. While Grupo Iusacell has continued to make partial payments to us, our net accounts receivable related to Grupo Iusacell was approximately $28.2 million as of December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related 45 Table of Contents disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, stock based compensation, income taxes, and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2009. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F 7. Impairment of Assets Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non Core Long Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment, which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. We monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value, as compared to the assets carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. Impairment of Assets Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. All of our goodwill is recorded in our rental and management segment and tested for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We utilize the two step traditional impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results, the current weighted average cost of capital, and a current tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value, as calculated using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the rental and management reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the rental and management reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2009, no impairment was determined under the first step of the test. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none 46 Table of Contents of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: a 15% reduction in projected net income, a 200 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, and a 15% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $18.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The increase in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 approximated $36.3 million, $50.4 million and $69.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. Stock Based Compensation: We measure stock based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. Income Taxes: We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable 47 Table of Contents statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have classified approximately $16.5 million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $15.2 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2009, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $47.8 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $0.9 billion and $0.9 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2029. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2009. Estimated Useful Lives of Assets: As described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of 2008. Based on this review, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets, primarily its network location intangible assets, from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, effective January 1, 2008. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million and an increase in net income of approximately $74.4 million. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which designated the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as the source of all authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental 48 Table of Contents entities. All guidance contained in the ASC carries an equal level of authority. The ASC supersedes all existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other nongrandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC is considered nonauthoritative. The implementation and adoption of the guidance provided by the ASC had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which, among other things, eliminates the step acquisition model, requires that contingent consideration be recognized at the time of acquisition (instead of being recognized when it is probable), disallows the capitalization of transaction costs, and changes when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized. This guidance also establishes additional disclosure requirements that enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of business combinations. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009 and, upon adoption, approximately $1.2 million of transaction costs previously capitalized in notes receivable and other long term assets was expensed. In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires the classification of noncontrolling interest as a separate component of equity and disclosure clearly identifying, and distinguishing between, parent and noncontrolling owner interests. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009 and did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position. However, we have adjusted our presentation of noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In February 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which delayed the effective date of applying fair value measures to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis (that is, at least annually) to January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which, among other things, changes disclosure requirements and requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why entities use derivative financial instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We have included additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance was effective for us as of April 1, 2009. Beginning with our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we have included additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In May 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, which, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should disclose events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date, and the disclosures entities should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This guidance was effective for us as of June 30, 2009. Beginning with our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we have included additional disclosures regarding our review of subsequent events (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Accounting Standards Updates In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities. This guidance requires companies to allocate the 49 Table of Contents overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling prices for deliverables. This guidance is effective for any contracts entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, with early adoption available. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies some of the existing disclosure requirements and adds additional disclosure requirements with respect to fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our disclosures; however, the adoption of these updates will have no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. In addition, in May 2009, we entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL. This foreign currency exchange contract was not designated as a hedging instrument and was settled upon the completion of the acquisition of XCEL on May 27, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased or redeemed approximately $725.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase and redemption of $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% Notes, the redemption of $500.0 million principal amount of our 7.125% Notes and the redemption of $0.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. As of December 31, 2009, $550.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan was fully drawn. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2009, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates ($1.75 billion); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million) (the 5.0% notes matured on February 15, 2010, and were repaid using cash on hand); the 7.25% Notes ($300.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2009 is $295.0 million); ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 (the 7.00% Notes) ($500.0 million); the XCEL credit facility ($73.4 million); the 4.625% Notes ($600.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2009 is $599.2 million); and other debt of $59.0 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 2.84%. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.63%. As of December 31, 2008, variable rate debt consists of our Revolving Credit Facility ($750.0 million drawn) and Term Loan ($325.0 million) included above based on the June 8, 2012 maturity date. As of December 31, 2008, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (2.25% Notes) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $501.1 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($162.2 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $161.9 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.1 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 4.16%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expired in December 2009. (c) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (d) Includes notional amounts of $525.0 million that expire between January and March 2011. (e) Represents the weighted average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (f) The increase in the interest rate is primarily due to the scheduled payments under the XCEL credit facility. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2009, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $200.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase, or approximately 28 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico, Brazil and India. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the remeasurement loss from these operations approximated $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $5.7 million.
