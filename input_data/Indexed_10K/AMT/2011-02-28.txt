ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates beginning on page 40. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in our business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding: depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segments also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long term obligations, other income (expense), net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi tenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Increased expansion activity in international markets and changes to our organizational structure have led us to separately disclose our rental and management operations in two reportable segments: domestic rental and management and international rental and management. Through our network development services segment, we also offer tower related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Accordingly, our continuing operations are now reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of December 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $13.5 billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue, absent the impact of straight line lease accounting. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancellable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our tenants, which increases the non cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their 25 Table of Contents terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 3% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. The primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for our domestic and international rental and management segments are: Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (legacy sites); Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and New revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (new sites). We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. Key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth. Domestic. The majority of wireless subscribers in the United States currently utilize 3G technology based handsets, for both voice and data applications. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. This level of wireless communications services growth has produced consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment and as a result, we have experienced consistent demand for our communications sites. In addition, wireless service providers in the United States continue to pursue new avenues for growth, such as deploying 4G technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As wireless service providers begin to deploy 4G wireless networks, we expect them to overlay 4G equipment across their existing networks of communications sites, resulting in additional revenue. Subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand, we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their 4G wireless networks as subscribers transition from 3G handsets. In connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment, this technology migration path has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate their networks from one technology to the next to remain competitive. 26 Table of Contents International. In general, our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services. As a result, demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments, new market entrants and initial 3G data network deployments. For example, in India, nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in 3G data networks, as a result of recent spectrum auctions. In Mexico and Brazil, where nationwide voice networks have been deployed, some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G data networks, and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3G data networks. In markets such as Chile and Peru, recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants, who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and 3G data networks. We believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks. Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities, including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,800 sites. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios, both domestically and internationally, that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2010 2009 2008 Domestic 947 528 160 International(1) 6,865 3,022 801 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed internationally during 2010 and 2009 were in India and our newly launched operations in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. In general, our rental and management segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. In geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint, we may incur additional segment level selling, general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. REIT Election. As we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state NOLs, we are actively considering an election to a REIT for U.S. federal and, where applicable, state income tax purposes. We may make the determination to elect REIT status for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, as early as the second half of 2011, subject to the approval of our board of directors, although there is no certainty as to the timing of a REIT election or whether we will make a REIT election at all. 27 Table of Contents Non GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (Adjusted EBITDA). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net; income from equity method investments; income tax provision (benefit); other income (expense); loss on retirement of long term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating expenses; depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is the primary measure used by our management team when evaluating the performance of our operating segments, it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants and it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non operating factors are involved. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, has been included below. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (In thousands) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,565,474 $ 1,408,352 $ 157,122 11 % International 370,899 260,068 110,831 43 Total rental and management 1,936,373 1,668,420 267,953 16 Network development services 48,962 55,694 (6,732 ) (12 ) Total revenues $ 1,985,335 $ 1,724,114 $ 261,221 15 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 15% to $1,985.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 11,400 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2009. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in network development services segment revenue. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 11% to $1,565.5 million. This growth was comprised of: Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations and a one time revenue item, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and a decline in revenue attributable to a tenant take or pay agreement and settlement from 2009, which did not recur in 2010; and 28 Table of Contents Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 2%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 43% to $370.9 million. This growth was comprised of: Approximately 8% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and the positive impact from straight line lease accounting, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and renegotiations with our largest tenant in Mexico; and Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 35%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 12% to $49.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2009 for a material acquisition, zoning and permitting project with a major tenant, which did not recur in 2010. Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,240,114 $ 1,096,350 $ 143,764 13 % International 262,842 202,290 60,552 30 Total rental and management 1,502,956 1,298,640 204,316 16 Network development services 22,005 23,309 (1,304 ) (6 ) Total gross margin $ 1,524,961 $ 1,321,949 $ 203,012 15 % Total gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 15% to $1,525.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin attributable to our network development services segment. Domestic rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $1,240.1 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 4% increase in direct operating costs, of which 1% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 3% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 30% to $262.8 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 70% increase in direct operating costs, including pass through expenses, of which 10% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy international sites and 60% was attributable to the incremental costs associated with the addition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 6% to $22.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue attributable to our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. 29 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 62,295 $ 55,635 $ 6,660 12 % International 45,877 30,551 15,326 50 Total rental and management 108,172 86,186 21,986 26 Network development services 6,312 5,816 496 9 Other 115,285 109,692 5,593 5 Total selling, general, administrative and development expense $ 229,769 $ 201,694 $ 28,075 14 % Total selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 14% to $229.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and corporate overhead to support the continued growth of our operations. These increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense. Domestic rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 12% to $62.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to initiatives designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance, as well as costs associated with establishing a dedicated team to more actively pursue new product lines, such as shared generators and outdoor DAS networks. International rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 50% to $45.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased international expansion, including acquisitions of several tower businesses in India, as well as costs associated with our recent expansion initiatives in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Network development services segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 9% to $6.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our new tower development and our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other selling, general administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 5% to $115.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $13.7 million increase in corporate expenses, which were partially offset by a $8.1 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee and increased information technology costs associated with supporting a growing global organization. The decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the one time expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards in 2009, which did not recur in 2010.

The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in both our rental and management segments gross margin, and was partially offset by increases in overhead costs attributable to both of our rental and management segments. Domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $1,177.8 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin (13%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment overhead costs (12%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 26% to $217.0 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (30%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment overhead costs (50%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 10% to $15.7 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and an increase in segment overhead costs, as described above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 460,726 $ 414,619 $ 46,107 11 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 11% to $460.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 7,800 sites since January 1, 2010, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $10.7 million in acquisition related costs, an increase of approximately $4.1 million in impairments and losses on the sale of assets, and an increase of $1.7 million of consulting and legal costs associated with our evaluation of a potential election to a REIT. Interest Expense Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 246,018 $ 249,803 $ (3,785 ) (2 )% Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 2% to $246.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.82% to 5.52%, partially offset by an increase in average debt outstanding. 31 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Income tax provision $ 182,489 $ 182,565 $ (76 ) (0 )% Effective tax rate 32.8 % 43.3 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 remained relatively flat at $182.5 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased to 32.8% from 43.3%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced foreign withholding taxes, the recognition of previously reserved NOLs and a reduction in the foreign currency impact on certain tax items. The effective tax rates on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non deductible stock based compensation expense, tax reserves and state taxes.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating profit, as described above, an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 14% to $1,347.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (15%) and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses, excluding stock based compensation expense. 32 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (In thousands) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,408,352 $ 1,320,530 $ 87,822 7 % International 260,068 226,505 33,563 15 Total rental and management 1,668,420 1,547,035 121,385 8 Network development services 55,694 46,469 9,225 20 Total revenues $ 1,724,114 $ 1,593,504 $ 130,610 8 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,724.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 4,500 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2008. This increase was also a result of an increase in network development services segment revenue. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 7% to $1,408.4 million. The revenue growth was comprised of: Approximately 6% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites and contractual tenant lease escalations, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and straight line lease accounting; and Revenue growth from new sites of 1%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 700 new domestic sites since January 1, 2008. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 15% to $260.1 million. The revenue growth was comprised of: Approximately 17% of international rental and management segment revenue growth was attributable to the addition of approximately 3,800 new international sites since January 1, 2008; and Approximately 2% from revenue decline for our legacy international sites, as a result of the impact of foreign currency translations experienced during the year ended December 31, 2009. The negative impact of foreign currency translations was partially offset by the growth in our core business, including incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites and contractual rent escalations. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 20% to $55.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our expanding site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. 33 Table of Contents Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,096,350 $ 1,016,205 $ 80,145 8 % International 202,290 182,059 20,231 11 Total rental and management 1,298,640 1,198,264 100,376 8 Network development services 23,309 19,638 3,671 19 Total gross margin $ 1,321,949 $ 1,217,902 $ 104,047 9 % Total gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 9% to $1,321.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and an increase in gross margin attributable to our network development services segment. Domestic rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,096.4 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 3% increase in direct operating costs, of which 2% growth was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 1% growth was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 700 new domestic sites since January 1, 2008. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 11% to $202.3 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 23% increase in direct operating costs, which was primarily driven by a 29% increase in direct operating costs attributable to the addition of approximately 3,800 new international sites since January 1, 2008. The increase in costs from new sites was partially offset by a 6% decrease in direct operating expenses associated with our legacy international sites as a result of the impact of foreign currency translations experienced during the year ended December 31, 2009. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 19% to $23.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the gross margin generated from our expanding site acquisition, zoning and permitting services.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in costs attributable to our international rental and management segment, an increase of $5.9 million in stock based compensation expense, and an increase in costs attributable to our domestic rental and management segment, which were partially offset by a reduction in other corporate expenses. 34 Table of Contents Domestic rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $55.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to non recurring legal costs and the write off of capitalized costs associated with discontinued development projects. International rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 86% to $30.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense and the write off of capitalized costs associated with discontinued development projects, as well as costs to support our growing international operations. Network development services segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 34% to $5.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our expanding site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other selling, general administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 2% to $109.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.9 million increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of a one time expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards in 2009, and was partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses.

The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in both our rental and management segments gross margin, and was partially offset by increases in total overhead costs attributable to both our rental and management segments as well as our network development services segment. Domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,040.7 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin (8%) and was partially offset by increases in selling, general, administrative and developmental expense (8%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 4% to $171.7 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin (11%), as described above, and was partially offset by increases in selling, general, and administrative and development expense (86%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 14% to $17.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above. 35 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 414,619 $ 405,332 $ 9,287 2 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 2% to $414.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 3,550 sites since January 1, 2009, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Other operating expenses $ 19,168 $ 11,189 $ 7,979 71 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 71% to $19.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $6.3 million in acquisition related costs which were expensed as a result of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Approximately $1.2 million of these costs are related to the expensing of amounts which had been recorded as other long term assets at December 31, 2008 for pending acquisitions and the remaining $5.1 million relates to additional acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in impairments and losses on the sale of assets. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 249,803 $ 253,584 $ (3,781 ) (1 %) Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased 1% to $249.8 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in average outstanding debt, partially offset by an increase in our weighted average cost of borrowing to 5.82% from the previous year. Loss on Retirement of Long term Obligations Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Loss on retirement of long term obligations $ 18,194 $ 4,904 $ 13,290 271 % Loss on retirement of long term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 271% to $18.2 million as a result of amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write off of the related deferred financing fees, discounts and premiums. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in refinancing activities during 2009, which included our tender offer and subsequent redemption of $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $231.7 million, and our repurchase of an aggregate of $500.0 million principal amount of our 7.125% senior notes due 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million. 36 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% convertible notes due August 1, 2010 and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Income tax provision $ 182,565 $ 135,509 $ 47,056 35 % Effective tax rate 43.3 % 36.4 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 35% to $182.6 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 43.3% from 36.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the discrete impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain tax items, IRS audit adjustments and certain valuation allowances, partially offset by the decrease in tax reserves. In addition, the increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rates on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non deductible stock based compensation expense, IRS audit adjustments of approximately $10.0 million, tax reserves and state taxes. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Income from discontinued operations, net $ 8,179 $ 110,982 $ (102,803 ) (93 %) Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 93% to $8.2 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to the recording of an income tax benefit of $110.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (Verestar). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestars plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. The $102.8 million decrease was partially offset by an insurance reimbursement received during the year ended December 31, 2009 for approximately $5.0 million related to the Verestar bankruptcy settlement. 37 Table of Contents Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Net income $ 247,127 $ 347,415 $ (100,288 ) (29 %) Income from discontinued operations, net (8,179 ) (110,982 ) (102,803 ) (93 ) Income from continuing operations 238,948 236,433 2,515 1 Income from equity method investments (26 ) (22 ) 4 18 Income tax provision 182,565 135,509 47,056 35 Other income (1,294 ) (5,988 ) (4,694 ) (78 ) Loss on retirement of long term obligations 18,194 4,904 13,290 271 Interest expense 249,803 253,584 (3,781 ) (1 ) Interest income (1,722 ) (3,413 ) (1,691 ) (50 ) Other operating expenses 19,168 11,189 7,979 71 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 414,619 405,332 9,287 2 Stock based compensation expense 60,670 54,807 5,863 11 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,180,925 $ 1,092,335 $ 88,590 8 % Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 29% to $247.1 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in income from discontinued operations, net from the prior year period, which as described above, was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recognized in 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,180.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (9%), and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses (12%).

Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately $400 million and $450 million in 2011, with spending for capital improvements, corporate expenditures and the redevelopment of existing communications sites at levels comparable to 2010. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $80 million to $100 million for ground lease purchases and $200 million to $220 million for other capital projects including the construction of approximately 1,200 to 1,500 new communications sites.

The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 $ $ $ $ 1,750,000 $ $ $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) 300,000 300,000 Term Loan(1) 325,000 325,000 Colombian Short Term Credit Facility(2) 72,889 72,889 4.50% senior notes 1,000,000 1,000,000 5.05% senior notes 700,000 700,000 4.625% senior notes 600,000 600,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 7.25% senior notes 300,000 300,000 Long term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 72,889 625,000 1,750,000 600,000 2,500,000 5,547,889 Cash interest expense(1) 274,000 266,000 264,000 190,000 145,000 395,000 1,534,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,343 4,068 3,533 3,424 3,455 179,526 199,349 Total debt service obligations 352,232 895,068 267,533 1,943,424 748,455 3,074,531 7,281,238 Operating lease payments(3) 257,971 254,575 251,268 246,392 238,035 2,584,332 3,832,573 Other long termliabilities(4)(5) 434 462 467 471 475 978,312 980,621 Total $ 610,637 $ 1,150,105 $ 519,268 $ 2,190,287 $ 986,965 $ 6,637,175 $ 12,094,432 (1) We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2010 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.10%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 0.25% through its maturity on June 8, 2012. (2) The Colombian Short Term Credit Facility is denominated in Colombian Pesos and was entered into in connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for 508 towers from Coltel. 43 Table of Contents (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (5) Other long term liabilities exclude $26.0 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $18.0 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Refinancing Activities Redemption of ATI 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes During the year ended December 31, 2010, ATI issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining $0.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (ATI 7.25% Notes). In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes, the remaining ATI 7.25% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, September 23, 2010, for an aggregate purchase price of $0.3 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2010, we held 12 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $525.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 3.74% and expiration dates through March 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swaps, which had an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2010, one of the contracts matured. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guarantees, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with 44 Table of Contents which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we could incur approximately $2.23 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $372 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we could incur approximately $2.14 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $714 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) to Interest Expense of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, our interest expense, which was $237 million for that period, could increase by approximately $285 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $713 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization. The loan agreement related to the Securitization involved assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the Borrowers), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 1 (the Certificates). The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization 45 Table of Contents loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $444.0 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (DSCR). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were: 1.30x or less, during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or 1.75x or less, thereafter, (1.30x or 1.75x as applicable, the Cash Trap DSCR), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the Securitization loan until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an Amortization Period under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An Amortization Period would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below: 1.15x, during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or 1.45x thereafter (1.15x or 1.45x as applicable, the Minimum DSCR). In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, and our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2010, the Borrowers DSCR was 3.34x. Based on the Borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2010 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $201.0 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $215.8 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. 46 Table of Contents As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. Impairment of Assets Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis, which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. A cashflow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy. To the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers, the towers and network location intangible assets are impaired. We monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customer related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the 47 Table of Contents asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the assets carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. Impairment of Assets Goodwill Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As a result of our recent expansion into international markets and changes to our organization structure, we have concluded that our rental and management operations are comprised of two reportable segments: domestic rental and management and international rental and management. Although our reportable segments have changed, there has been no change to the reporting units (which are at a level below that of our reportable segments) used for testing goodwill. All of our goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results, the current weighted average cost of capital, and a current tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2010, no impairment was determined under the first step of the test, as the fair value of the respective reporting units is substantially in excess of their carrying values. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: Domestic rental and management reporting unit: A 15% reduction in projected net income, or 200 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 15% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. International rental and management reporting units: A 3% reduction in projected net income, or 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 12% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $3.3 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $2.2 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset 48 Table of Contents retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the criteria of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those acquisitions that do not meet the criteria of a business combination, we first allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer base and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and allocation may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized. Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the fixed, non cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 approximated $105.2 million, $36.3 million and $50.4 million, respectively. Amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 59% of our revenues are derived from four customers in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and customers. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on managements estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customers inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured. Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us 49 Table of Contents such that renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight line rent liability in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation. Stock Based Compensation: We measure stock based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2010, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $48.2 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2030. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in managements judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, 50 Table of Contents which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, we have classified approximately $26.0 million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $18.0 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2010. Accounting Standards Updates In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities. This guidance allows companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables. This guidance is effective for any contracts entered into, or materially modified after January 1, 2011. We do not anticipate this update will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2010, we held 12 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $525.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 3.74% and expiration dates through March 2011. In addition, in May 2009, we entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL. This foreign currency exchange contract was not designated as a hedging instrument and was settled upon the completion of the acquisition of XCEL on May 27, 2009. The settlement resulted in a gain of approximately $1.7 million, which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, ATI redeemed approximately $0.3 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes and we repaid $59.7 million of the 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 and the outstanding balance of the XCEL Credit Facility (approximately $77.3 million). In addition, in August and December of 2010, we completed registered public offerings of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.05% senior notes due 2020 (5.05% Notes) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2018 (4.50% Notes). As of December 31, 2010, $300.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan was fully drawn.

A 10% increase, or 31 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in stockholders equity and as a component of comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 19% of our total revenues and approximately 24% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, as compared to 15% and 19% respectively, during the same period in 2009. 53 Table of Contents We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or cash flows.
