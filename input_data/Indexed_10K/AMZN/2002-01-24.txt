Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from managements expectations. The following discussion includes forward looking statements regarding expectations of future pro forma operating profitability and loss, net sales, cash flows from operations and free cash flows, all of which are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general, the Internet and online commerce, customer spending patterns, the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, risks of inventory management, the degree to which we enter into, maintain and develop relationships with third party sellers and other strategic transactions, fluctuations in the value of securities and non cash payments we receive in connection with such transactions, foreign currency exchange risks, seasonality, international growth and expansion, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results, which, along with the following discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. 21 Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales include the selling price of consumer products sold by us, less promotional gift certificates and sales returns; outbound shipping charges billed to our customers; commissions and other amounts earned from sales of new and used products on Amazon Marketplace, Auctions and zShops; amounts earned (fixed fees, sales commissions, per unit activity fees, or some combination thereof) for sales of retail products through our Merchant@amazon.com Program, including our strategic alliances with Toysrus.com and Circuit City; the selling price of consumer products sold by us through our Syndicated Stores program, such as www.borders.com; amounts earned (fixed fees, sales commissions, per unit activity fees, or some combination thereof) in connection with our Merchant Program, such as Target.com, which is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2002; commissions earned from third parties who utilize our technology services such as search, browse and personalization; and amounts earned for miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. Net sales were $3.12 billion, $2.76 billion and $1.64 billion for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing annual growth rates of 13% and 68% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The reduced annual growth rate in our net sales is reflective of several factors, including the larger base comparison that results from our rapid growth in previous years, a shift in the source of our product sales towards new and used products sold through Amazon Marketplace, and declines in general economic conditions. Net sales for our U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment were $1.69 billion, $1.70 billion and $1.31 billion for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These results represent an annual decline in net sales for our U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment of 1% for 2001, and an annual growth rate of 30% for 2000. This segment includes retail sales from www.amazon.com of books, music and DVDs/video products and for magazine subscriptions. This segment also includes commissions from sales of these products, new or used, through Amazon Marketplace and product revenues from stores offering these products through our Syndicated Stores Program, such as www.borders.com. Amazon Marketplace represented 12% of total orders in our U.S. Retail segments, primarily relating to our U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment, during 2001. Amazon Marketplace orders were nominal in the prior year. The slowing annual growth rate reflects several factors including a shift in the source of our product sales towards new and used products sold through Amazon Marketplace, a continuing focus on balancing revenue growth with achieving operating profitability, and declines in general economic conditions. Net sales for our U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen segment were $547 million, $484 million and $151 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These results represent an annual growth rate of 13% for 2001. Since our U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen segment began in the second half of 1999, annual growth rates for 2000 are not meaningful. This segment includes www.amazon.com retail sales of electronics, computers, camera and photo items, software, computer and video games, cell phones and service, tools and hardware, outdoor living items, kitchen and houseware products, toys and video games sold other than through our strategic alliance with Toysrus.com, Inc., as well as catalog sales of toys, tools and hardware. This segment also includes commissions from sales of these products, new or used, through Amazon Marketplace and commissions or other amounts earned from offerings of these products by third party sellers through our Merchant@amazon.com Program, such as our strategic alliance with Circuit City. Excluding online sales of toys and video games which, since September 2000, have been sold at www.amazon.com primarily through our strategic alliance with Toysrus.com and reported in our Services segment, annual growth rates for our U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen segment would have been 28% for 2001. Annual growth in net sales for our U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen segment reflects increases in units sold by our electronics, kitchen and housewares, and outdoor living stores in comparison with 2000, offset by the effects of declines in average selling prices per unit, declines in general economic conditions, and the fact that most online sales of toys and video games are now sold through our strategic alliance with Toysrus.com and the corresponding revenue is therefore reported in our Services segment. 22 Net sales for our Services segment were $225 million, $198 million and $13 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These results represent an annual growth rate of 13% for 2001. Since we began offering services in late 1999, annual growth rates for 2000 are not meaningful. This segment consists of commissions, fees and other amounts earned from our business to business strategic alliances, including our Merchant Program and, to the extent product categories are not also offered by us through our online retail stores, our Merchant@amazon.com Program, as well as our strategic alliance with America Online, Inc. This segment also includes Auctions, zShops and Payments, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. The increase in net sales from our Services segment during 2001 was primarily associated with our Toysrus.com strategic alliance, which commenced September 2000, offset by the conclusion of certain of our initial strategic marketing relationships. Included in service revenues are equity based service revenues of $27 million, $79 million and $7 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Equity based service revenues result from private and public securities received by us and amortized into our results of operations over the period services are performed. Net sales for our International segment were $661 million, $381 million and $168 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These results represent annual growth rates of 74% and 127% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. This segment includes all retail sales of our four internationally focused Web sites: www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp. These international sites share a common Amazon experience, but are localized in terms of language, products, customer service and fulfillment. This segment includes commissions and other amounts earned from offerings of these products by third party sellers through our Merchant@amazon.com Program, and product revenues from stores offering these products through our internationally focused Syndicated Stores Program, such as www.waterstones.co.uk. The annual growth rate in 2001 reflects increases in units sold by our www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.uk sites, as well as the launch of our www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp sites during the second half of 2000. The annual growth rate for our International segment during 2000 primarily relates to sales from our www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de Web sites, and are reflective of the early stage of their operation with relatively smaller comparison sales bases. Sales to customers outside the United States, including export sales from www.amazon.com (which are reported in the corresponding U.S. segment), represented, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, approximately 29% and 22% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Shipping revenue, which consists of outbound shipping charges to our customers, across all segments was $357 million, $339 million and $239 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Shipping revenue generally corresponds with unit sales levels, offset by our periodic free and the reduced shipping promotions. In January 2002, we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering free shipping for certain orders of $99 or more. We offer or may offer a similar shipping option for our internationally focused Web sites. The effect of this shipping offer will reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales, and will cause our gross margins on retail sales to decline. We expect net sales to be between $775 million and $825 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2002, an increase of between 11% and 18%, and net sales to increase 10% or more in 2002 compared to 2001. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results. Gross Profit Gross profit is net sales less the cost of sales, which consists of the purchase price of consumer products sold by us, inbound and outbound shipping charges to us, packaging supplies, and certain costs associated with our service revenues. Costs associated with our service revenues classified as cost of services generally include fulfillment related costs to ship products on behalf of third party sellers, costs to provide customer service, credit card fees and other related costs. 23 We are currently considering prospectively changing our inventory costing method to the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting which would, if applied, become effective January 1, 2002. We are currently determining the effect this change would have on our financial statements, whether this change would be significant, and whether it meets preferability requirements under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe the change would facilitate our record keeping process, and in turn, our ability to provide fulfillment services to third party companies as part of our services offering, and would result in increased consistency with others in our industry. Although we have not yet completed our analysis of this potential change, based on our preliminary analysis, we do not anticipate the effect of such change, if applied, to have a significant cumulative effect on results of operations in the fiscal year of adoption, nor on amounts previously reported as inventory or Cost of sales as if the FIFO method had been applied in previous years. Gross profit was $799 million, $656 million and $291 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing increases of 22% and 126% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross margin was 26%, 24% and 18% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Increases in the absolute dollars of gross profit during each period corresponds with increases in units sold, improvements in inventory management, and improved product sourcing. Excluding the results of our Services segment, gross margin would have been 23%, 21% and 17%, respectively. Gross profit for our U.S. Books, Music and DVD/video segment was $453 million, $417 million and $263 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which represents increases of 9% and 59% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross margin was 27%, 25% and 20% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Improvements in gross margins during 2001 correspond with improvements in inventory management, continued improvements in product sourcing and, to a lesser extent, the higher margin sales of new and used products sold through Amazon Marketplace, offset by higher customer discounts. Improvements in gross margin during 2000 in comparison to 1999 reflect improvements in inventory management and product sourcing, and lower customer discounts offered. Gross profit for our U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen segment was $78 million and $45 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing an increase of 76% for 2001. This segment reported a gross loss of $20 million for 1999. Gross margin was 14% and 9% for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and negative 13% during 1999. Improvements in gross profit for each of the comparative periods corresponds with increases in net sales, improvements in product sourcing, the introduction of new product categories, and improvements in inventory management. Also, since most online sales of toys and video games, since September 2000, are sold through our strategic alliance with Toysrus.com, the corresponding gross profit is therefore reported in our Services segment. Gross profit for our Services segment was $126 million, $116 million and $12 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which represents an increase of 9% for 2001. Since we began offering services in late 1999, annual growth rate for 2000 is not meaningful. Costs associated with our service revenues classified as cost of services generally include fulfillment related costs to ship products on behalf of third party sellers, costs to provide customer service, credit card fees and other related costs. Gross margin was 56%, 59% and 93% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gross profit from our Services segment largely corresponds with revenues from our business to business strategic alliances, which includes our Merchant Program and, to the extent product categories are not also offered by us through our online retail stores, the Merchant@amazon.com Program, as well as our strategic alliance with America Online, Inc. Gross profit for our Services segment also includes amounts earned through Auctions, zShops and Payments, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. The decline in gross margin from our Services segment for 2001 relates to service costs classified in cost of sales resulting from the shift in the mix of our strategic relationships towards alliances that incorporate a broader range of services, including fulfillment. Also contributing to the decline in Services gross margin was a reduction in high margin marketing and promotional agreements. Included in service revenues are equity based service revenues of $27 million, $79 million and $7 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Equity based service revenues result from private and public securities received by us and amortized into our results of operations over the period services are performed. 24 Gross profit for our International segment was $141 million, $77 million and $36 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which represents increases of 82% and 118% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross margin was 21%, 20% and 21% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in our absolute gross profit dollars during 2001 and 2000 reflects increases in units sold by our www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.uk sites in comparison with the same periods in the prior year, as well as the launch of our www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp sites during the second half of 2000. The increase in our absolute gross profit dollars during 1999 relates primarily to increases in units sold by our www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.uk sites in comparison with the same periods in the prior year. Shipping gross loss across all segments was $19 million and $1 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and shipping gross profit was $12 million for 1999. The gross loss in shipping in 2001 and 2000 was due, in part, to a higher revenue mix from our business units in countries that offer free shipping or product lines that involve low margin shipping, as well as selective free shipping promotions in the U.S. Shipping losses incurred from our internationally focused Web sites, which are included in shipping results across all segments, were $14 million, $6 million and $4 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. We continue to measure our shipping results relative to their effect on our overall financial results, with the viewpoint that shipping promotions are an effective promotional tool. In January 2002, we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering free shipping for certain orders of $99 or more. We offer or may offer a similar shipping option for our internationally focused Web sites. The effect of this shipping offer will reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales, and will negatively affect gross margins on our retail sales. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing our fulfillment and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging and preparing customers orders for shipment; credit card fees and bad debt costs; and responding to inquiries from customers. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third party co sourcers who assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Certain fulfillment related costs to ship products on behalf of third party sellers, excluding those costs associated with Syndicated Stores, are classified as cost of sales rather than fulfillment. Fulfillment costs were $374 million, $415 million and $237 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing 12%, 15% and 14% of net sales for the corresponding periods. Excluding net sales from our services segment, fulfillment costs represent 13%, 16% and 15% of net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales during 2001 in comparison to 2000 results from improvements in productivity, the increase in units fulfilled helping to leverage our fixed cost base, a decline in customer service contacts resulting from improvements in our customer self service features available on our Web sites, improved balancing of inventory throughout our network that resulted in fewer split shipments, and our operational restructuring announced in January 2001. Our operational restructuring included the closure of our fulfillment center in McDonough, Georgia; the seasonal closure of our Seattle, Washington fulfillment center, which was not utilized during the 2001 holiday season; and the closure of our customer service centers in The Hague, Netherlands and Seattle, Washington. Marketing Marketing expenses consist of advertising, promotional and public relations expenditures, and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. Marketing expenses, net of co operative marketing reimbursements, were $138 million, $180 million and $176 million, representing 4%, 7% and 11% of net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Declines in expense for marketing related activities in comparison to prior years reflect management efforts to target advertising spending in channels considered most effective at driving incremental net sales (such as targeted on line advertising through various Web portals and our Associates Program), an increase in co operative marketing allowances during 2001, and the general decline in market costs for advertising related promotions. In January 2002 we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering free shipping for certain orders of $99 or more. We offer or may offer a similar 25 shipping option for our internationally focused Web sites. Although marketing expenses do not include our free and reduced shipping offers, we view such promotions as an effective marketing tool. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations personnel and consultants; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and costs of acquired content, including freelance reviews. Technology and content expense was $241 million, $269 million and $160 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing 8%, 10% and 10% of net sales for the corresponding periods, respectively. The decline in absolute dollars spent during 2001 in comparison to the prior year primarily reflect our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a less costly technology infrastructure, as well as improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories, including data and telecommunication services, due to market overcapacity. The increase in absolute dollars spent during 2000 in comparison to 1999 primarily reflects past investments in our systems and telecommunications infrastructure to support the continual enhancements to our Web site, as well as costs associated with launching our www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp sites during 2000. We expect to continue to invest in technology and improvements in our Web sites during 2002, which may include, but is not limited to, offering additional Web site features and product categories to our customers and implementing additional strategic alliances, as well as potentially continuing our international expansion. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses were $90 million, $109 million and $70 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, representing 3%, 4% and 4% of net sales for the corresponding periods, respectively. The decline in absolute dollars of general and administrative costs during 2001 in comparison with 2000 was primarily due to our operational restructuring plan announced in January 2001, which reduced the number of positions in corporate and administrative roles and consolidated our corporate office locations. The increase in general and administrative costs during 2000 in comparison to 1999 relates primarily to increases in personnel, facility related costs associated with our corporate expansion, and professional fees associated with general corporate matters. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation includes stock based charges resulting from variable accounting treatment of certain stock options, option related deferred compensation recorded at our initial public offering, as well as certain other compensation and severance arrangements. Stock based compensation also includes the portion of acquisition related consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees of certain acquired businesses, which must be classified as compensation expense rather than as a component of purchase price under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Stock based compensation was $5 million, $25 million and $31 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The declines in stock based compensation during 2001 and 2000 in comparison to the prior respective years resulted from the full vesting and corresponding full recognition of deferred stock based compensation relating to employees of certain acquired businesses. 26 The following table shows the amounts of stock based compensation that would have been recorded under the following categories had stock based compensation not been separately stated on the statements of operations. For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (in thousands) Fulfillment $ 481 $ (1,606 ) $ 188 Marketing 690 (858 ) 3,957 Technology and content 2,723 28,253 25,322 General and administrative 743 (992 ) 1,151 $ 4,637 $ 24,797 $ 30,618 During the first quarter of 2001, we offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options. The exchange resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase 31 million shares of common stock with varying exercise prices in exchange for 12 million employee stock options with an exercise price of $13.375. The option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for, at the time of the exchange, approximately 15 million stock options, which includes options granted under the exchange offer and 3 million options, with a weighted average exercise price of $52.41, that were subject to the exchange offer but were not exchanged. Variable accounting will continue until all options subject to variable accounting treatment are exercised, cancelled or expired. At December 31, 2001, approximately 12 million options remain under variable accounting treatment, which includes 11 million options granted under the exchange offer, which, if not previously exercised, will expire on September 30, 2003, and 1 million options, with a weighted average exercise price of $39.61, that were subject to the exchange offer but were not exchanged. Variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable and potentially significant charges or credits recorded to Stock based compensation, dependent on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock. We have quantified the hypothetical effect on Stock based compensation associated with increases in the quoted price of our common stock using a sensitivity analysis for our outstanding stock options subject to variable accounting at December 31, 2001. We have provided this information to provide additional insight into the potential volatility we may experience in the future in our results of operations to the extent that the quoted price for our common stock rises above $13.375. This sensitivity analysis is not a prediction of future performance of the quoted prices of our common stock. Using the following hypothetical increases in the market price of our common stock above $13.375, our hypothetical cumulative compensation expense at December 31, 2001 resulting from variable accounting treatment would have been as follows: Hypothetical Increase Over $13.375 Hypothetical Market Price per Share Hypothetical Cumulative Compensation Expense (in thousands) 5% $14.04 $ 6,788 10% $14.71 $ 12,578 15% $15.38 $ 18,369 25% $16.72 $ 29,950 50% $20.06 $ 58,902 If at the end of any fiscal quarter the quoted price of our common stock is lower than the quoted price at the end of the previous fiscal quarter, or to the extent previously recorded amounts relate to unvested portions of options that were cancelled, compensation expense associated with variable accounting will be recalculated using the cumulative expense method and may result, in certain circumstances, in a net benefit to our results of operations. 27 Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $181 million, $322 million and $215 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded an impairment loss of $184 million on goodwill and other intangibles relating to certain of our 1999 acquisitions. This impairment loss reduced our recorded basis in goodwill and other intangibles and had the effect of reducing amortization expense during 2001. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles, effective January 1, 2002. Under this nonamortization approach, goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations, but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value. We expect the adoption of this accounting standard will result in approximately $25 million of other intangible assets being subsumed into goodwill, and will have the effect of substantially reducing our amortization of goodwill and intangibles commencing January 1, 2002. Transitional impairments, if any, are not expected to be material; however, impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs. Restructuring Related and Other Restructuring related and other expenses were $182 million, $200 million and $8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In the first quarter of 2001, we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs, streamline our organizational structure, and consolidate certain of our fulfillment and customer service operations. This initiative involved the reduction of employee staff by approximately 1,300 positions in managerial, professional, clerical, technical and fulfillment roles; consolidation of our Seattle, Washington corporate office locations; closure of our McDonough, Georgia fulfillment center; seasonal operation of our Seattle, Washington fulfillment center (if necessary); closure of our customer service centers in Seattle, Washington and The Hague, Netherlands; and migration of a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform, which entails ongoing lease obligations for technology infrastructure no longer being utilized. Each component of the restructuring plan has been substantially completed. As of December 31, 2001, 1,327 employees had been terminated, and actual termination benefits paid were $12 million. Costs that relate to ongoing operations are not part of restructuring charges and are not included in Restructuring related and other. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 96 9, Classification of Inventory Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring, all inventory adjustments that may result from the closure or seasonal operation of our fulfillment centers are classified in Cost of goods sold on the statements of operations. As of December 31, 2001, there have been no significant inventory write downs resulting from the restructuring, and none are anticipated. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the charges associated with the restructuring were as follows (in thousands): Asset impairments $ 68,528 Continuing lease obligations 87,049 Termination benefits 14,970 Broker commissions, professional fees and other miscellaneous restructuring costs 11,038 $ 181,585 Asset impairments primarily relate to the closure of the McDonough, Georgia fulfillment center, the write off of leasehold improvements in vacated corporate office space, and the decline in the fair value of assets in the Seattle, Washington fulfillment center. For assets to be disposed of, we estimated the fair value based on expected salvage value less costs to sell. For assets held for continued use, the decline in fair value was measured 28 using discounted estimates of future cash flows. At December 31, 2001 the carrying amount of assets held for disposal was not significant. Continuing lease obligations primarily relate to heavy equipment previously used in the McDonough, Georgia fulfillment center, vacated corporate office space, technology infrastructure no longer being utilized, and the unutilized portion of our back up data center. We are actively seeking third parties to sub lease abandoned equipment and facilities. Amounts expensed represent estimates of undiscounted future cash outflows, offset by anticipated third party sub leases. At December 31, 2001, we remain obligated under gross lease obligations of $121 million associated with our operational restructuring and we anticipate receiving sub lease income of $68 million to offset these obligations, of which $17 million is to be received under non cancelable subleases. Given the uncertainty of estimating future sub lease rentals, actual results may differ from estimates which may result in significant additional expenses for us and corresponding net cash outflow above amounts expected. Termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees terminated in connection with the operational restructuring, as well as $2.5 million of our common stock contributed to a trust fund for the benefit of terminated employees. Termination benefits do not include any amounts for employment related services prior to termination. Other restructuring costs include professional fees, decommissioning costs of vacated facilities, broker commissions and other miscellaneous expenses directly attributable to the restructuring. At December 31, 2001, the accrued liability associated with the restructuring related and other charges was $61 million and consisted of the following (in thousands): Balance at March 31, 2001 Subsequent Accruals, net Non Cash Settlements and Other Adjustments Payments Balance at December 31, 2001 Due Within 12 Months Due After 12 Months Lease obligations $ 34,667 $ 52,738 $ (2,675 ) $ (31,543 ) $ 53,187 $ 35,578 $ 17,609 Termination benefits 8,445 113 (2,354 ) (6,143 ) 61 61 Broker commissions, professional fees and other miscellaneous restructuring costs 4,121 5,052 1,559 (2,542 ) 8,190 5,159 3,031 $ 47,233 $ 57,903 $ (3,470 ) $ (40,228 ) $ 61,438 $ 40,798 $ 20,640 Cash payments resulting from our operational restructuring during 2001 were $49 million. We anticipate the restructuring charges will result in the following net cash outflows (in thousands): Leases Termination Benefits Other Total Year Ending December 31, 2002 $ 35,578 $ 61 $ 5,159 $ 40,798 2003 5,476 3,031 8,507 2004 2,016 2,016 2005 1,983 1,983 2006 2,068 2,068 Thereafter 6,066 6,066 Total estimated cash outflows $ 53,187 $ 61 $ 8,190 $ 61,438 During 2000, we identified certain levels of impairment corresponding with the business unit goodwill and other intangibles initially recorded in connection with the following acquisitions: Alexa Internet, Back to Basics Toys, Inc., Livebid, Inc., and the catalog and Internet assets of Acme Electric Motor Co. (Tool Crib). Accordingly, we recorded an impairment loss of $184 million. Also during 2000, we recorded an impairment loss of $11 million relating to the decline in fair value, measured using discounted estimates of future cash flows, of 29 certain fixed assets. The fixed asset impairment amount included $4 million, $3 million and $4 million of computers, equipment and software; leasehold improvements; and leased assets, respectively. Other costs associated with our acquisition related activities were $5 million and $8 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. No such amounts were recorded during 2001. Loss from Operations Our loss from operations was $412 million, $864 million and $606 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The improvement in operating loss for 2001 in comparison with the prior period was primarily due to an increase in gross profit; a reduction in certain operating costs including fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative; and declines in charges such as amortization of goodwill and other intangibles. Net Interest Expense and Other Net interest expense and other, excluding Other gains (losses), net, was $112 million, $100 million and $37 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest income was $29 million, $41 million and $45 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest expense was $139 million, $131 million and $85 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999. Other income and expense, consisting primarily of realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, miscellaneous state and foreign taxes and certain realized foreign currency related transactional gains and losses, was an expense of $2 million and $10 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and a gain of $2 million for 1999. Interest income relates primarily to interest earned on fixed income securities and correlates with the average balance of those investments and prevailing interest rates. The increase in interest expense during 2001 in comparison with 2000 is primarily related to our February 2000 issuance of the 6.875% PEACS. Other components of interest expense include our February 1999 issuance of $1.25 billion of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes), and our May 1998 issuance of approximately $326 million gross proceeds of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the Senior Discount Notes). At December 31, 2001, our total long term indebtedness was $2.16 billion. Other Gains (Losses), Net Other gains (losses), net were recorded during 2001 and 2000, resulting in net costs of $2 million and $143 million, respectively. No comparable amounts were recorded during 1999. Other gains (losses), net consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 (in thousands) Foreign currency gains on 6.875% PEACS $ 46,613 $ Losses on sales of Euro denominated investments, net (22,548 ) Other than temporary impairment losses, equity investments (43,588 ) (188,832 ) Contract termination by third parties 22,400 6,033 Net gains from acquisition of investments by third parties 784 40,160 Warrant fair value remeasurements and other (5,802 ) $ (2,141 ) $ (142,639 ) Effective January 1, 2001, currency gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of the 6.875% PEACSs principal from Euros to U.S. dollars each period are recorded to Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations. Prior to January 1, 2001, 6.875% PEACSs principal of 615 million Euros was designated as a hedge of equivalent amount of Euro denominated investments classified as available for sale; accordingly, currency gains and losses on the 6.875% PEACS were recorded to Accumulated other 30 comprehensive loss on our balance sheets as hedging offsets to currency gains and losses on the Euro denominated investments. As the hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, commencing January 1, 2001, the foreign currency change resulting from the portion of the 6.875% PEACS previously hedging the available for sale securities is now being recorded on our statements of operations. For 2001, the remeasurement of the 6.875% PEACS resulted in a gain of $47 million consisting of a $10 million gain reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a $37 million gain attributable to remeasurement of the 6.875% PEACS during the period. We are unable to forecast or predict the loss or gain on our Euro denominated debt that will result from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in future periods; any such amounts may have a significant effect on our future reported results. During 2001 and 2000, we recorded impairment losses, which totaled $44 million and $189 million, respectively, relating to other than temporary declines in certain of our equity investments. These impairments were recorded to reflect the investments at fair value as of the date of impairment. During 2001, our other than temporary declines in fair value of investments were associated with our investments in Webvan Group, Inc, Sothebys Holdings, Inc., WeddingChannel.com, Inc., Ashford.com, Inc., Audible, Inc., drugstore.com, inc., and Angel II Investors, L.P. During 2000, our other than temporary declines in fair value of investments were associated with Audible, NextCard, Inc., Webvan, Ashford.com, Greg Manning Auctions, Inc, and Sothebys. At December 31, 2001 we have no further loss exposure relating to our investment in Webvan. In February 2001, we terminated our commercial agreement with Kozmo.com and recorded a non cash gain of $22 million, representing the amount of unearned revenue associated with the contract. Since services had not yet been performed under the contract, no amounts associated with this commercial agreement were recognized in Net sales during any period. Furthermore, during 1999, we made a cash investment of $60 million to acquire preferred stock of Kozmo.com and accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting. Pursuant to the equity method of accounting, we recorded our share of Kozmo.com losses, which, during 2000, reduced our basis in the investment to zero. Accordingly, when Kozmo.com announced its intentions to cease operations in April 2001, we did not have any further loss exposure relating to our investment. We will not recover any portion of our investment in Kozmo.com. During 2000, we recorded a gain of $40 million relating to the acquisition of Homegrocer.com by Webvan, and a $6 million net gain relating to the bankruptcy of Living.com, Inc. that is comprised of a $14 million loss representing our remaining investment balance in Living.com and a $20 million gain relating to the unamortized portion of unearned revenue associated with the Living.com commercial agreement. As of December 31, 2001, our recorded basis in equity securities was $41 million, including $13 million classified as Marketable securities, $10 million classified as Investments in equity method investees, and $18 million classified as Other equity investments. Equity in Losses of Equity Method Investees Equity in losses of equity method investees represents our share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. This influence is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on our investees Board of Directors and the effect of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Equity method losses were $30 million, $305 million and $77 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Equity method losses declined during 2001 in comparison with 2000 because such losses reduced many of our underlying investment balances until the recorded basis was reduced to zero. Our basis in equity method investments was $10 million, $52 million and $227 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 2001, we issued $5 million of our common stock in exchange for an ownership interest that results in significant influence in Altura International, which operates Catalogcity.com. No cash investments were made in 31 equity method investees during 2001. As equity method losses are only recorded until the underlying investments are reduced to zero, we expect, absent additional investments in the voting stock of third parties, equity method losses to continue to decline in future periods in comparison with prior periods. Income Taxes We provided for current and deferred income taxes in state and foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries produce taxable income. As of December 31, 2001, we have a net deferred tax asset of $2 million, which consists primarily of state net operating losses. We have provided a full valuation allowance against the remaining portion of our deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating losses, because of uncertainty regarding its future realization. Net Loss Net loss was $567 million, $1.4 billion and $720 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although we reported net income of $5 million during the fourth quarter of 2001, we believe that this positive net income result is not predictive of future results or trends and should not be viewed as a material positive event for a variety of reasons. For example, excluding the foreign currency gain associated with our 6.875% PEACS we would have reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, we continue to be unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items, including the gain or loss associated with our 6.875% PEACS that will result from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and the effect on our results associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options. Pro Forma Results of Operations We provide certain pro forma information regarding our results from operations, which excludes the following line items on our statements of operations: stock based compensation, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and restructuring related and other charges. We also provide certain pro forma information regarding our net loss, which excludes, in addition to the line items described above, the following line items on our statements of operations: other gains (losses), net; equity in losses of equity method investees, net; and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. This pro forma information is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, however, we use this pro forma measure internally to evaluate our performance and believe it may be useful. For information about our financial results, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, see Item 6 of Part II, Selected Consolidated Financial Data, and Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 32 Full year and corresponding quarterly pro forma results of operations, and certain cash flow information for 2001, 2000 and 1999, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2001 Full Year Fourth Quarter  Third Quarter  Second Quarter  First Quarter  Pro forma income (loss) from operations $ (45,002 ) $ 58,680 $ (27,072 ) $ (28,009 ) $ (48,601 ) Pro forma net income (loss) $ (157,031 ) $ 34,785 $ (58,005 ) $ (57,528 ) $ (76,283 ) Pro forma income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales (1 %) 5 % (4 %) (4 %) (7 %) Pro forma basic income (loss) per share $ (0.43 ) $ 0.09 $ (0.16 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.21 ) Pro forma diluted income (loss) per share $ (0.43 ) $ 0.09 $ (0.16 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.21 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic income (loss) per share 364,211 371,420 368,052 359,752 357,424 Shares used in computation of pro forma diluted income (loss) per share 364,211 384,045 368,052 359,752 357,424 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (119,782 ) $ 349,120 $ (64,403 ) $ 2,485 $ (406,984 ) Year Ended December 31, 2000 Full Year Fourth Quarter  Third Quarter  Second Quarter  First Quarter  Pro forma loss from operations $ (317,000 ) $ (59,946 ) $ (68,439 ) $ (89,349 ) $ (99,266 ) Pro forma net loss $ (417,158 ) $ (90,426 ) $ (89,493 ) $ (115,704 ) $ (121,535 ) Pro forma loss from operations as a percentage of net sales (11 %) (6 %) (11 %) (15 %) (17 %) Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share $ (1.19 ) $ (0.25 ) $ (0.25 ) $ (0.33 ) $ (0.35 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic and diluted loss per share 350,873 355,681 353,954 349,886 343,884 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (130,442 ) $ 247,653 $ (3,688 ) $ (54,029 ) $ (320,378 ) Year Ended December 31, 1999 Full Year Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Pro forma loss from operations $ (352,371 ) $ (175,349 ) $ (79,198 ) $ (67,253 ) $ (30,571 ) Pro forma net loss $ (389,815 ) $ (184,885 ) $ (85,810 ) $ (82,786 ) $ (36,334 ) Pro forma loss from operations as a percentage of net sales (21 %) (26 %) (22 %) (21 %) (10 %) Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share $ (1.19 ) $ (0.55 ) $ (0.26 ) $ (0.26 ) $ (0.12 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic and diluted loss per share 326,753 338,389 332,488 322,340 313,794 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (90,875 ) $ 31,506 $ (75,573 ) $ (29,614 ) $ (17,194 ) 33 The following is a reconciliation of our pro forma results for 2001, 2000 and 1999.

The pro forma results are derived from information recorded in our financial statements. For the quarter ending March 31, 2002, we expect our pro forma loss from operations to be between a loss of $16 million and break even, or between a loss of 2% to 0% of net sales. For the full year of 2002, we expect that our pro forma income from operations will be $30 million or more. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $540 million and $822 million, and our marketable securities balance was $456 million and $278 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Combined cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $997 million and $1.10 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Equity securities of $13 million are included in Marketable securities at December 31, 2001, the value of which may fluctuate significantly. Equity securities of $36 million were included in Marketable securities at December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2001, our principal commitments consisted of long term obligations totaling $2.16 billion related primarily to our 6.875% PEACS, 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Senior Discount Notes; trade payables of $445 million; accrued expenses and other liabilities of $305 million, which includes current restructuring related obligations of $41 million; as well as $474 million in obligations related to operating leases and commitments for advertising and promotional arrangements. We generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers. As a result of holiday sales, at December 31 of each year our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance reaches its highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable, which at December 31, 2001 was $445 million. The majority of our accounts payable balance at December 31, 2001 will be settled during the first three months of 2002 and will result in a corresponding decline in the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, offset by amounts payable associated with activity in the first quarter of 2002. We have pledged a portion of our marketable securities as collateral for stand by letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, a majority of which relates to property leases; the swap agreement that hedges the foreign exchange rate risk on a portion of our 6.875% PEACS; and some of our real estate lease agreements. The amount of marketable securities we are required to pledge pursuant to the swap agreement fluctuates with the fair market value of the swap obligation. At December 31, 2001, the total amount of collateral pledged under these agreements was as follows (in thousands): Stand by letters of credit $ 77,635 Swap agreement 48,498 Real estate leases 40,657 $ 166,790 35 The following are our contractual commitments associated with our operational restructuring, debt obligations, lease obligations, and our marketing agreements (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Restructuring related commitments: Leases $ 35,578 $ 5,476 $ 2,016 $ 1,983 $ 2,068 $ 6,066 $ 53,187 Other 5,220 3,031 8,251 Restructuring related commitments 40,798 8,507 2,016 1,983 2,068 6,066 61,438 Other Commitments: Debt principal and other 4,775 4,462 2,004 74 2,123,593 2,134,908 Debt interest 109,501 122,704 135,906 135,906 135,906 388,563 1,028,486 Capital leases 11,339 6,573 41 17,953 Operating leases 60,837 57,501 48,729 41,953 42,400 206,373 457,793 Marketing agreements 16,411 217 16,628 Other commitments 202,863 191,457 186,680 177,933 178,306 2,718,529 3,655,768 Total commitments $ 243,661 $ 199,964 $ 188,696 $ 179,916 $ 180,374 $ 2,724,595 $ 3,717,206 Net cash used by operating activities consists of net loss offset by certain adjustments not affecting current period cash flows, and the effect of changes in working capital. Adjustments to net income to determine cash flows from operations include depreciation and amortization, equity in losses of investees, and other items not affecting cash flows in the current period. Net cash used by operating activities during 2001 was $120 million, resulting from our net loss of $567 million, offset by adjustments not affecting 2001 cash flows of $412 million, and changes in working capital of $36 million. Net cash used by operating activities during 2000 was $130 million, resulting from our net loss of $1.41 billion, offset by adjustments not affecting 2000 cash flows of $1.10 billion, and changes in working capital of $178 million. Net cash used by operating activities during 1999 was $91 million resulting from our net loss of $720 million, offset by adjustments not affecting 1999 cash flows of $405 million, and changes in working capital of $224 million. Improvements in cash flows from operating activities and an improvement in inventory turns during 2001 were partially offset by slower revenue growth and a decline in the average number of days trade payables remain outstanding due to, among other things, a shift in revenue mix towards segments with shorter payment terms, such as U.S. Electronics, Tools and Kitchen and International. Cash used in investing activities during 2001 was $253 million, consisting of net purchases of marketable securities of $197 million, purchases of fixed assets of $50 million and cash paid for acquired assets of $6 million. Cash provided by investing activities during 2000 was $164 million, consisting of net sales of marketable securities of $361 million offset by cash paid for investments of $63 million and purchases of fixed assets of $135 million. Cash used in investing activities during 1999 was $952 million, consisting of net purchases of marketable securities of $295 million, purchases of fixed assets of $287 million and cash paid for investments of $370 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2001 was $107 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to America Online as well as exercises of stock options, offset by repayments of long term capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2000 and 1999 was $693 million and $1.10 billion, respectively, consisting primarily of net proceeds from our issuance of debt securities. During 2000, we issued 690 million Euros of 6.875% PEACS, and during 1999 we issued $1.25 billion of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to have positive operating cash flow, and possibly free cash flow, for fiscal year 2002. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial 36 position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Strategic Alliances Beginning in 1999, we offered services to other e commerce companies including permitting third parties to offer products or services on our Web site, and promotional services such as advertising placements and customer referrals. We may enter into similar transactions in the future. Beginning with our strategic alliance with Toysrus.com in 2000, we began expanding our range of services. We now offer a variety of services to third parties, including offering consumer products sold by us through Syndicated Stores; allowing third parties to utilize our technology services such as search, browse and personalization; and powering third party Web sites, providing fulfillment services, or both. In exchange for the services we provide under these agreements, we receive cash and or equity securities of these companies (additional benefits may include Web site traffic). The amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is dependent on the volume of sales which the other company makes. In some cases, such as our agreement with drugstore.com, we have also made separate investments in the other company by making a cash payment in exchange for equity securities of that company. As part of this program, we may in the future make additional investments in companies with which we have already formed strategic alliances or companies with which we form new strategic alliances or similar arrangements. To the extent we have received equity securities as compensation, fluctuations in the value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of amounts we have received as compensation for services. For equity securities of public companies, we generally determine fair value based on the quoted market price at the time we enter into the underlying commercial agreement, and adjust such market price appropriately if significant restrictions on marketability exist. Because an observable market price does not exist for equity securities of private companies, our estimates of fair value of such securities are more subjective than for the securities of public companies. For significant transactions involving equity securities in private companies, we obtain and consider independent, third party valuations where appropriate. Such valuations use a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value, including comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying price multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company, and utilizing estimated discounted cash flows for that company. These valuations also reduce the otherwise fair value by a factor that is intended to account for restrictions on control and marketability where appropriate. Using these valuations and other information available to us, such as our knowledge of the industry and knowledge of specific information about the investee, we determine the estimated fair value of the securities received. The fair value of these securities, less the net amount of cash we paid for them, is then recorded as unearned revenue. Our recorded unearned revenue resulting from these transactions and any additional proceeds received under the arrangements is recognized as revenue over the terms (generally, one to three years) of the commercial agreements with these companies. Pursuant to EITF Issue No. 00 8, Accounting by a Grantee for an Equity Instrument to Be Received in Conjunction with Providing Goods or Services, we do not adjust unearned revenue to give effect to either an increase or decrease in value of the equity securities subsequent to their initial measurement (to the extent that such securities are either not subject to vesting or forfeiture or, if subject to vesting or forfeiture, were not received or modified after March 16, 2000). Therefore, the value of equity securities recorded as unearned revenue could decline in value significantly after the initial measurement is made. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience losses with respect to investments in strategic companies that are not equity method investees as a result of either liquidation of such investments at a loss or provision for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of these investments. See Other gains (losses), net. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, amend our agreements with certain of the companies with which we have strategic alliances to reduce future cash proceeds to be received by us, shorten the term of our commercial agreements, or both. Although these amendments did not affect the amount of unearned revenue 37 previously recorded by us, the timing of revenue recognition of these recorded unearned amounts has been changed to correspond with the terms of the amended agreements. These amendments or future amendments will affect the timing and amount of revenues recognized in connection with these strategic alliances. To the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable, we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received, excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable. As future amounts are subsequently received, such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2001, our recorded basis in equity securities was $41 million, including $13 million classified as Marketable securities, $10 million classified as Investments in equity method investees, and $18 million classified as Other equity investments. During 2001 and 2000, activity in unearned revenue was as follows (in thousands): Balance, December 31, 1999 $ 54,790 Cash received or cash receivable 97,818 Fair value of equity securities received 106,848 Amortization to revenue (108,211 ) Contract termination (20,128 ) Balance, December 31, 2000 131,117 Cash received or cash receivable 114,738 Fair value of equity securities received 331 Amortization to revenue (135,808 ) Contract termination (22,400 ) Balance, December 31, 2001 $ 87,978 During the first quarter of 2001, we recognized previously unearned revenue associated with the termination of our commercial agreement with Kozmo.com, which was included in Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations. Since services had not yet been performed under the contract, no amounts associated with the Kozmo.com commercial agreement were previously recognized in Net sales on our statements of operations during any period. During 2000, living.com declared bankruptcy and terminated its commercial agreement with us. As a result, we recorded a net gain of $6 million, comprised of a $14 million impairment loss representing our remaining investment balance in living.com and a $20 million gain relating to the unamortized portion of unearned revenue associated with the living.com commercial agreement as we were no longer obligated to perform services. The gain and the loss are recorded net and included in Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our 38 excess cash in A rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity, and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2001. Amounts are as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value at December 31, 2001 Commercial paper and short term obligations $ 419,098 $ $ $ $ $ $ 419,098 $ 418,936 Weighted average interest rate 2.33 % 2.33 % Certificates of deposit 18,159 18,159 18,159 Weighted average interest rate 3.48 % 3.48 % Corporate notes and bonds 26,520 7,800 34,320 37,602 Weighted average interest rate 2.98 % 4.00 % 3.21 % Asset backed and agency securities 6,209 73,070 149,765 1,767 230,811 232,821 Weighted average interest rate 2.55 % 3.42 % 3.63 % 7.64 % 3.56 % Treasury notes and bonds 11,900 72,100 36,700 120,700 125,947 Weighted average interest rate 2.05 % 2.44 % 3.42 % 2.70 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 455,366 $ 171,690 $ 194,265 $ $ $ 1,767 $ 823,088 $ 833,465 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity, and weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2000. Amounts were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value at December 31, 2000 Commercial paper and short term obligations $ 677,895 $ $ $ $ $ $ 677,895 $ 677,895 Weighted average interest rate 5.40 % 5.40 % Corporate notes and bonds 950 7,937 8,560 17,447 17,447 Weighted average interest rate 4.45 % 4.95 % 4.95 % 4.92 % Asset backed and agency securities 21,507 11,718 11,114 19,635 20,747 84,721 85,189 Weighted average interest rate 5.68 % 5.96 % 4.71 % 6.87 % 7.39 % 6.30 % Treasury notes and bonds 42,535 74,021 25,595 142,151 142,085 Weighted average interest rate 5.05 % 5.22 % 4.52 % 5.04 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 742,887 $ 93,676 $ 45,269 $ $ 19,635 $ 20,747 $ 922,214 $ 922,616 At December 31, 2001, we have long term debt of $2.16 billion primarily associated with our 6.875% PEACS, 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and Senior Discount Notes, which are due in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments, principal payments, or a combination thereof. The market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest, and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2001, net sales from our internationally focused Web sites (www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, and www.amazon.co.jp) accounted for 21% of consolidated revenues. Net sales generated from these Web sites, as well as most of the related expenses incurred, are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding Web sites. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, and www.amazon.co.jp is the same as the local currency 39 of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan, respectively. Results of operations from our foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that operate our internationally focused Web sites are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of operations of our internationally focused Web sites for 2001 was not material. At December 31, 2001, we were also exposed to foreign currency risk related to our 6.875% PEACS and Euro denominated cash equivalents and marketable securities (Euro Investments). The 6.875% PEACS have an outstanding principal balance of 690 million Euros ($609 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2001), and our Euro Investments, classified as available for sale, had a balance of 179 million Euros ($158 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2001). As the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange ratio varies, the value of our Euro Investments, when translated, will fluctuate. Debt principal of 615 million Euros is remeasured each period, which results in currency gains or losses that are recorded in Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations. We hedge the exchange rate risk on debt principal of 75 million Euros and a portion of the interest payments using a cross currency swap agreement. Under the swap agreement, we agreed to pay at inception and receive upon maturity 75 million Euros in exchange for receiving at inception and paying at maturity $67 million. In addition, we agreed to receive in February of each year 27 million Euros corresponding with interest payments on 390 million Euros of the 6.875% PEACS and, simultaneously, to pay $32 million. This agreement is cancelable, in whole or in part, at our option at no cost on or after February 20, 2003 if our common stock price (converted into Euros) is greater than or equal to 84.883 Euros, the minimum conversion price of the 6.875% PEACS. We account for the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on the debt principal and interest. Gains and losses on the swap agreement are initially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheets and recognized in Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations upon the recognition of the corresponding currency losses and gains on the remeasurement of the 6.875% PEACS. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2001, our recorded basis in equity securities was $41 million, including $13 million classified as Marketable securities, $10 million classified as Investments in equity method investees, and $18 million classified as Other equity investments. We invest in the stock and or warrants of both private and public companies, including companies with which we have formed strategic alliances, primarily for strategic purposes. At December 31, 2001, our investments in securities of publicly held companies was $16 million, and our investments in securities of privately held companies was $25 million. We have also received securities, including warrant investments, from some of the companies with which we have formed strategic alliances in exchange for services provided by us to those companies. Our investments are accounted for under the equity method if we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Some of our cost method investments are in private companies and are accounted for at cost and others are in public companies and are accounted for as available for sale securities and recorded at fair value. Warrant investments are generally carried at fair value. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During 2001, we recorded impairment losses totaling $44 million to write down several of our equity securities to fair value. All of these investments are in companies involved in the Internet and e commerce industries and their fair values are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2001, an assumed 15%, 30% or 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $6 million, $12 million or $21 million, respectively. 40
