Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from managements expectations. The following discussion includes forward looking statements regarding expectations of future pro forma profitability, net sales, cash flows from operations and free cash flows, all of which are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general, the Internet and online commerce, customer spending patterns, the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, risks of inventory management, the degree to which we enter into, maintain and develop relationships with other businesses, fluctuations in the value of securities and non cash payments we receive in connection with such transactions, foreign exchange risks, seasonality, international growth and expansion and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, 21 Table of Contents Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results, which, along with the following discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Results of Operations Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Significant Accounting Policies Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are valued at the lower of cost or market value, which requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition (whether through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors or liquidations), and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, which is applied consistently from period to period, we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We evaluate the criteria outlined in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales, net of promotional discounts, rebates and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier (commonly referred to as F.O.B. Shipping Point). Return allowances (which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns) are estimated using historical experience. 22 Table of Contents We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include percentage discounts off current purchases (current discount offers), offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase (inducement offers) and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in Net sales. Inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Commissions received through our Amazon Marketplace and Merchants@ programs and amounts earned through our Merchant.com program are recorded as net amounts since we are acting as an agent. Amounts earned are recognized as net sales when the item is sold by the third party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. We earn revenues from services primarily by entering into business to business commercial agreements, including providing our technology services such as search, browse and personalization; permitting other businesses and individuals to offer products or services through our Web sites; and powering third party Web sites, either with or without providing accompanying fulfillment services. These commercial agreements also include miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. As compensation for the services we provide under these agreements, we generally receive cash. In the past, we have accepted as compensation under these arrangements equity securities, or a combination of equity securities and cash. Generally, the fair value of the equity consideration received is measured when the agreement is executed, but to the extent that the equity consideration is subject to forfeiture or vesting provisions and no significant performance commitment exists upon execution of the agreement, the fair value of the equity consideration and corresponding revenue is determined as of the date that the forfeiture provision lapses or as the vesting provision lapses. Subsequent to initial measurement of fair value, appreciation or decline in the fair value of such securities will affect our ultimate realization of equity securities received as compensation; however, any such change does not affect the amount of revenue to be recognized over the term of the agreement. We generally recognize revenue from these marketing and promotional services (including revenues associated with non refundable advance payments) on a straight line basis over the period during which we perform services under these agreements, commencing at the launch date of the service. If we receive non refundable advance payments, such amounts are deferred for revenue recognition purposes until service commences. Included in Services segment revenues are equity based service revenues of $13 million, $27 million and $79 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We have in the past, and may in the future, amend our agreements with certain of the companies with which we have commercial agreements to modify future cash proceeds to be received by us, modify the service term of our commercial agreements, or both. Although these amendments generally do not affect the amount of unearned revenue previously recorded by us (if any), the timing of future revenue recognition changes to correspond with the terms of amended agreements. These amendments or future amendments will affect the timing and amount of revenues recognized in connection with these commercial agreements. To the extent we believe any such amendments cause or may cause the compensation to be received under an agreement to no longer be fixed or determinable, we limit our revenue recognition to amounts received, excluding any future amounts not deemed fixed or determinable. As future amounts are subsequently received, such amounts are incorporated into our revenue recognition over the remaining term of the agreement. Fair Value of Equity Securities Received as Compensation Under Commercial Agreements For equity securities of public companies received as compensation under commercial agreements, we generally determine fair value based on the quoted market price at the time we enter into the underlying commercial agreement and adjust such market price appropriately if significant restrictions on marketability exist. Because an observable market price does not exist for equity securities of private companies, our estimates of fair value of such securities are more subjective than for the securities of 23 Table of Contents public companies. For significant transactions involving equity securities in private companies, we obtain and consider independent, third party valuations where appropriate. Such valuations use a variety of methodologies to estimate fair value, including comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying price multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company, and utilizing estimated discounted cash flows for that company. These valuations also reduce the otherwise fair value by a factor that is intended to account for restrictions on control and marketability where appropriate. Using these valuations and other information available to us, such as our knowledge of the industry and the company itself, we determine the estimated fair value of the securities received. Accounting for Goodwill and Certain Other Intangibles Effective July 1, 2001, we adopted certain provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the full provisions of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill. We evaluated our goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to June 30, 2001 using the criteria of SFAS No. 141, which resulted in $25 million of other intangibles (comprised entirely of assembled workforce intangibles) being subsumed into goodwill at January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. We evaluated our intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives. SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures the impairment. We completed our first phase impairment analysis and found no instances of impairment of our recorded goodwill; accordingly, the second testing phase was not necessary during 2002. No subsequent indicators of impairment have been noted. Restructuring Estimates Restructuring related liabilities include estimates for, among other things, anticipated disposition of lease obligations. Key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated commencement timing of sublease rentals, estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs. We periodically evaluate and, if necessary, adjust our estimates based on currently available information. Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales include the selling price of consumer products sold by us, less promotional discounts, rebates and sales returns; outbound shipping charges billed to our customers; commissions and other amounts earned from sales of new and used products on Amazon Marketplace; amounts earned (fixed fees, sales commissions, per unit activity fees, or some combination thereof) for sales of retail products through our Merchants@ program, such as Toysrus.com and Target stores at www.amazon.com; the selling price of consumer products sold by us through our Syndicated Stores program, such as www.borders.com; amounts earned (fixed fees, sales commissions, per unit activity fees, or some combination thereof) in connection with our Merchant.com program, such as www.target.com; amounts earned from third parties who utilize our technology services such as search, browse and personalization; and amounts earned for miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. Net sales were $3.93 billion, $3.12 billion and $2.76 billion for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 26% and 13% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increases in 2002 net sales were primarily attributable to our International segment and our BMVD segment, which increased $508 million and $185 million in 2002, respectively. The increases in 2001 net sales were primarily 24 Table of Contents attributable to our International segment and our ETK segment, which increased $280 million and $63 million, respectively. During 2002, revenues improved $47 million in comparison to 2001 due to changes in foreign exchange rates (specifically the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro and the British Pound). Net sales for our BMVD segment were $1.87 billion, $1.69 billion and $1.70 billion for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing an increase of 11% for 2002 in comparison with a decline of 1% for 2001. This segment includes retail sales from www.amazon.com and www.amazon.ca of books, music and DVD/ video products and magazine subscription commissions. This segment also includes commissions from Amazon Marketplace sales of these products, new, used or collectible, amounts earned from sales of these products by other businesses through our Merchants@ program and product revenues from stores offering these products through our Syndicated Stores program. The improvement in growth rates for our BMVD segment in 2002 in comparison with 2001 reflects increased unit sales resulting from our continuing efforts to reduce prices for customers, including increases in customer discounts on books and the introduction of everyday free shipping at www.amazon.com for certain orders. Also contributing to the 2002 increase in growth rates for BMVD are increases in unit sales through Amazon Marketplace. Net sales for our ETK segment were $645 million, $547 million and $484 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 18% and 13% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. This segment includes www.amazon.com retail sales of electronics, home improvement and home and garden products, as well as our mail order catalog sales. This segment also includes commissions from sales of these products, new, used or collectible, through Amazon Marketplace and amounts earned from sales of these products by other businesses through our Merchants@ program, such as with Office Depot, and will include revenues from stores offering these products, if any, through our Syndicated Stores program. The improvement in growth rates for our ETK segment in 2002 in comparison with 2001 reflects increased unit sales resulting from our continuing efforts to reduce prices for customers, including increases in customer discounts through price changes and rebate programs and the introduction of everyday free shipping at www.amazon.com for certain orders. Also contributing to the 2002 increase in growth rates for ETK are increases in unit sales through Amazon Marketplace. Net sales for our International segment were $1.17 billion, $661 million and $381 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 77% and 74% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. We anticipate that as the revenue base of our International segment increases, the percentage growth rates will likely decline over time. During 2002, revenues improved $47 million in comparison to 2001 due to changes in foreign exchange rates (specifically the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro and the British Pound). This segment includes all retail sales of the following internationally focused Web sites: www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp. These international sites share a common Amazon.com experience, but are localized in terms of language, products, customer service and fulfillment. To the extent available on these sites, this segment includes commissions and other amounts earned from sales of products through Amazon Marketplace and revenues from stores offering products through our Syndicated Stores program, such as www.waterstones.co.uk and www.virginmega.co.jp, and amounts earned from sales of products by other businesses through our Merchants@ program. Our International segment includes export sales from www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp (including export sales from these sites to customers in the U.S. and Canada), but excludes export sales from www.amazon.com and www.amazon.ca. The increase in net sales from our International segment results from, in each of the four internationally focused Web sites, an increase in unit sales (in part due to the introduction of Amazon Marketplace on www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.jp), and our continuing efforts to reduce prices to customers through increases in customer discounts and free and reduced rate shipping offers. The future growth of our International segment may fluctuate significantly with changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results We Have Foreign Exchange Risk. Net sales for our Services segment were $246 million, $225 million and $198 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 9% and 13%, respectively. This segment consists of 25 Table of Contents commissions, fees and other amounts earned from our services business, including our Merchant.com program (such as www.target.com), and to the extent full product categories are not also offered by us through our online retail stores, our Merchants@ program, such as our apparel store, the Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com stores, and portions of the Target store at www.amazon.com, as well as our commercial agreement with America Online, Inc. This segment also includes Auctions, zShops, Amazon Payments and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. The increase in net sales from our Services segment results from amounts earned through our Merchants@ program and our Merchant.com program, offset by the expiration of certain of our marketing and promotional agreements. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of these services agreements is dependent on the volume of sales that the other company makes. See Item 1 of Part I Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results Our Business Could Suffer If We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances and Other Business Relationships. Shipping revenue (which consists of outbound shipping charges to our customers) across all operating segments was $365 million, $357 million and $339 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Shipping revenue does not include any commissions or other amounts earned from Amazon Marketplace. In January 2002, we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed a specified amount, and we lowered this threshold several times throughout the year. We offer similar shipping options for our internationally focused Web sites and may offer other free or reduced fee shipping options over time. These shipping offers reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and cause our gross margins on retail sales to decline. We view these shipping offers as an effective marketing tool. First quarter of 2003 net sales are expected to be between $1.025 billion and $1.075 billion, or grow between 21% and 27%. For the full year 2003, net sales are expected to grow over 15%. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part 1, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Gross Profit Gross profit is net sales less the cost of sales, which consists of the purchase price of consumer products sold by us, inbound and outbound shipping charges to us, packaging supplies and certain costs associated with our service revenues. Costs associated with our Services segment revenues and classified as cost of services generally include fulfillment related costs to ship products on behalf of third party sellers, costs to provide customer service, credit card fees and other related costs. Effective January 1, 2002, we prospectively changed our inventory costing method to the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting. This change resulted in a cumulative increase in product inventory of $0.8 million, with a corresponding amount recorded to Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the statements of operations in 2002. We evaluated the effect of the change on each quarter during 2001 and determined such effect to be less than $1.2 million individually and in the aggregate. We determined this change to be preferable under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since, among other reasons, it facilitates our record keeping process, significantly improves our ability to provide cost efficient fulfillment services to other companies as part of our services offering and results in increased consistency with others in our industry. Gross profit was $993 million, $799 million and $656 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 24% and 22% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin was 25%, 26% and 24% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increases in gross profit in 2002 primarily correspond with increases in units sold (including increased product sales through Amazon Marketplace), improvements in transportation and inventory management and improvements in product sourcing, offset by price reductions on books and electronics, the expiration of certain high margin marketing and promotional agreements, and our free and reduced rate shipping offers. Increases in gross profit in 2001 primarily correspond with improvements in inventory management and product sourcing, and to a lesser extent, increased product sales through Amazon Marketplace. Our overall gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including 26 Table of Contents our mix of sales during the period (including sales through Amazon Marketplace), competitive pricing decisions and general efforts to reduce prices for our customers over time, as well as the extent to which we provide free and reduced rate shipping offers. Gross profit for our BMVD segment was $528 million, $453 million and $417 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 16% and 9% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin was 28%, 27% and 25% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The slight improvement in gross margin corresponds with the increase in higher margin sales through Amazon Marketplace, improvements in transportation costs and inventory management, and continued improvements in product sourcing, offset by price reductions and our everyday free shipping offer. Gross profit for our ETK segment was $90 million, $78 million and $45 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 15% and 76% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin was 14% for 2002 and 2001 and 9% for 2000. In 2002, improvements in product sourcing, inventory management and transportation management, along with lower transportation costs, were offset by price reductions and our everyday free shipping offer. In 2001, improvement in gross margin primarily reflects improvements in product sourcing and inventory management. During 2002, sales of products through Amazon Marketplace increased significantly in comparison to the prior year. If product sales through Amazon Marketplace continue to increase, we anticipate improvement in gross margin, offset to the extent we offer additional or broader price reductions, free shipping offers and other promotions. Gross profit for our International segment was $249 million, $141 million and $77 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 77% and 82% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin was 21% for 2002 and 2001, and 20% for 2000. The increase in gross profit in 2002 reflects increases in units sold by each of our four internationally focused Web sites included in this segment (in part due to the introduction of Amazon Marketplace on www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.jp), offset by continuing efforts to reduce prices for our customers. During 2002, gross profit improved $10 million in comparison to 2001 due to changes in foreign exchange rates (specifically the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro and the British Pound).The increase in gross profit in 2001 reflects increases in units sold by our www.amazon.de and www.amazon.co.uk sites, as well as the launch of our www.amazon.fr and www.amazon.co.jp sites during the second half of 2000. Gross profit for our Services segment was $126 million for 2002 and 2001 and $116 million for 2000, representing flat gross profit in 2002 and an increase of 9% for 2001. Costs associated with our service revenues generally include fulfillment related costs to ship products on behalf of other businesses, including costs to provide customer service, credit card fees and other related costs. Gross margin was 51%, 56% and 59% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit from our Services segment largely corresponds with revenues from our commercial agreements, which includes our Merchant.com program and, to the extent product categories are not also offered by us through our online retail stores, the Merchants@ program, as well as amounts earned through miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements. The decline in gross margin from our Services segment relates to service costs classified in cost of sales resulting from the shift in the mix of our commercial relationships towards agreements that incorporate a broader range of services, including fulfillment. Also contributing to the decline in Services gross margin in 2002 was the expiration of certain high margin marketing and promotional agreements. We expect Services segment margins will decline again in 2003 since high margin marketing arrangements are expected to represent a lower percentage of our overall revenue mix for this segment. See Item 1 of Part 1 Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results Our Business Could Suffer If We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances and Other Business Relationships. Shipping loss across all operating segments was $40 million, $19 million and $1 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss from shipping primarily reflects the free and reduced rate shipping offers, offset in part by cost reductions from efficiencies in our outbound shipping. We continue to measure our shipping results relative to their effect on our overall financial results, with the viewpoint that shipping 27 Table of Contents promotions are an effective marketing tool. In January 2002, we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed specified purchase thresholds. We offer a similar shipping option for our internationally focused Web sites and may offer other free or reduced fee shipping options over time. We expect to continue offering our customers free shipping options which reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and negatively affect gross margins. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing our fulfillment and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment; credit card fees and bad debt costs; and responding to inquiries from customers. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third party co sourcers that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Certain Services segment fulfillment related costs incurred on behalf of other businesses are classified as cost of sales rather than fulfillment. Fulfillment costs were $392 million, $374 million and $415 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing 10%, 12% and 15% of net sales, respectively. The improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales results from improvements in productivity and accuracy, the increase in units fulfilled helping to leverage the fixed cost portion of our fulfillment network, a decline in customer service contacts per order resulting from improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features available on our Web sites. These improvements were offset, in part, by increases in employee wages and benefits and credit card interchange fees associated with Amazon Marketplace, which represent a higher percent of commissions earned relative to amounts earned from retail sales of our inventory. Additionally, the comparisons between 2001 and 2000 (and to a lesser extent the comparisons between 2002 and 2001) were affected by the closures in 2001 of our fulfillment centers in McDonough, Georgia and Seattle, Washington, and customer service centers in The Hague, Netherlands and Seattle, Washington. Marketing Marketing expenses consist of advertising, promotional and public relations expenditures, and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. Marketing expenses, net of co operative marketing reimbursements, were $125 million, $138 million and $180 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing 3%, 4% and 7% of net sales, respectively. To the extent co operative marketing reimbursements decline in future periods, we may incur additional expenses to continue certain promotions or elect to reduce or discontinue them. Declines in expense for marketing related activities reflect management efforts to cut ineffective marketing programs, as well as reduced rates charged to us for some online marketing activities. These decreases are partially offset by increased investment in marketing channels considered most effective in driving incremental net sales, such as targeted online advertising through various Web portals and our Associates program. In January 2002, we introduced a new shipping option at www.amazon.com, offering everyday free shipping for certain orders that exceed a specified amount. We offer similar shipping options for our internationally focused Web sites. Although marketing expenses do not include our free and reduced shipping offers, we view such offers as an effective marketing tool. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations personnel; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and costs of acquired content, including freelance reviews. Technology and content expenses were $216 million, $241 million and $269 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing 5%, 8% and 10% of net sales, respectively. The decline in absolute dollars spent for each comparative period primarily reflects our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a less costly technology infrastructure, as well as improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories. We expect to continue to invest in technology and improvements to our Web sites, which may 28 Table of Contents include, but are not limited to, hiring additional employees, offering additional Web site features and product categories to our customers and implementing additional commercial relationships, as well as potentially continuing our international expansion. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, human resources, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses were $79 million, $90 million and $109 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing 2%, 3% and 4% of net sales, respectively. The decline in 2002 in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to a decline in facility and depreciation costs resulting from our 2001 operational restructuring plan that consolidated our corporate office locations, and through continued efforts to improve efficiency. The decline in 2001 in general and administrative costs is attributable to reductions in most administrative expense categories, including employee related, facility and depreciation costs, supplies and other miscellaneous charges, as well as decreased costs as a result of our 2001 operational restructuring. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation was $69 million, $5 million and $25 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Stock based compensation includes stock based charges resulting from variable accounting treatment of certain stock options and restricted stock issued to certain key employees, as well as amounts associated with our newly implemented restricted stock unit program. Stock based compensation also includes, to a lesser extent, a portion of acquisition related consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of certain key employees of acquired businesses. Under our restricted stock unit program, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002, we award restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation associated with our restricted stock unit program was $4 million in 2002. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding vested and unvested employee stock awards (including restricted stock units) was approximately 45 million and 66 million, or 12% and 18% of our outstanding common stock, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During the first quarter of 2001, we offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options, which resulted in variable accounting treatment for approximately 5 million stock options at December 31, 2002, including approximately 4 million options granted under the exchange offer that have exercise prices of $13.375 and expire in the third quarter of 2003. Variable accounting treatment results in unpredictable and potentially significant charges or credits recorded to Stock based compensation, dependent on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock. We have quantified the hypothetical effect on Stock based compensation associated with various quoted prices of our common stock, which we are unable to forecast accurately, using a sensitivity analysis for our outstanding stock options subject to variable accounting at December 31, 2002. We have provided this information to give additional insight into the volatility we will experience in our future results of operations to the extent that the quoted price for our common stock is above $13.375. This sensitivity analysis is not a prediction of future performance of the quoted prices of our common stock. Using the following hypothetical market prices of our common stock above $13.375 (including the actual expense associated with options exercised), our hypothetical cumulative compensation expense at 29 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 resulting from variable accounting treatment would have been as follows (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts): Hypothetical vs. Actual Cumulative Hypothetical Increase Hypothetical Market Hypothetical Cumulative Compensation Expense Over $13.375 Price per Share Compensation Expense December 31, 2002 15 % $ 15.38 $ 47,471 $ (13,017 ) 25 % 16.72 52,423 (8,065 ) 50 % 20.06 64,802 4,314 75 % 23.41 77,181 16,693 100 % 26.75 89,561 29,073 Actual variable accounting related compensation could differ significantly from the above illustration in instances where options are exercised during a period at prices that differ from the closing stock price for the reporting period. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys common stock closed at $18.89, representing an increase of 41% over $13.375. Cumulative compensation expense associated with variable accounting treatment was $60 million, of which $40 million is associated with options exercised and therefore no longer subject to future variability. If at the end of any fiscal quarter the quoted price of our common stock is lower than the quoted price at the end of the previous fiscal quarter, or to the extent previously recorded amounts relate to unvested portions of options that were cancelled, compensation expense associated with variable accounting will be recalculated using the cumulative expense method and may result in a net benefit to our results of operations. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $5 million, $181 million and $322 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decline in amortization of goodwill and intangibles in 2002 primarily results from our adoption of SFAS No. 141, which resulted in $25 million of intangible assets, comprised of assembled workforce intangibles, being subsumed into goodwill, and our adoption of SFAS No. 142, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized. The decline in amortization of goodwill and intangibles in 2001 results from an impairment loss of $184 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 associated with certain of our 1999 business acquisitions. This impairment loss reduced our recorded basis in goodwill and other intangibles and had the effect of reducing amortization expense during 2001. Restructuring Related and Other Restructuring related and other expenses were $42 million, $182 million and $200 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In the first quarter of 2001, we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs, streamline our organizational structure, consolidate certain of our fulfillment and customer service operations and migrate a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform. This initiative involved the reduction of employee staff by 1,327 positions throughout the Company in managerial, professional, clerical, technical and fulfillment roles; consolidation of our Seattle, Washington corporate office locations; closure of our McDonough, Georgia fulfillment center; seasonal operation of our Seattle, Washington fulfillment center; closure of our customer service centers in Seattle, Washington and The Hague, Netherlands; and migration of a large portion of our technology infrastructure to a new operating platform, which entails ongoing lease obligations for technology infrastructure no longer being utilized. Actual employee termination benefits paid were $12 million. The restructuring is complete; however we may adjust our restructuring related estimates in the future, if necessary. During 2002, we revised our estimates of ongoing net lease obligations for our facilities in Seattle, Washington and McDonough, Georgia, primarily due to weakness in these real estate markets; we reached a termination agreement with the landlord of our leased fulfillment center facility in McDonough, Georgia, 30 Table of Contents which requires payments totaling $12 million (of which $4 million was paid in December 2002, with the balance payable in the first quarter of 2003); and we permanently closed our fulfillment center in Seattle, Washington. Restructuring related charges were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Asset impairments $ 1,182 $ 68,528 Continuing lease obligations 39,563 87,049 Termination benefits 14,970 Broker commissions, professional fees, and other miscellaneous restructuring costs 828 11,038 $ 41,573 $ 181,585 At December 31, 2002, the accrued liability associated with restructuring related and other charges was $57 million and consisted of the following (in thousands): Balance at Balance at December 31, Subsequent December 31, Due Within Due After 2001 Accruals, Net Payments 2002 12 Months(1) 12 Months(1) Lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income $ 53,187 $ 39,563 $ (41,534 ) $ 51,216 $ 20,903 $ 30,313 Termination benefits 61 (61 ) Broker commissions, professional fees and other miscellaneous restructuring costs 8,190 828 (3,393 ) 5,625 4,324 1,301 $ 61,438 $ 40,391 $ (44,988 ) $ 56,841 $ 25,227 $ 31,614 (1) Restructuring related liabilities due within 12 months and due after 12 months are classified in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Long term debt and other, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash payments resulting from our operational restructuring were $45 million and $49 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. We estimate, based on currently available information, the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be as follows (in thousands): Leases Other Total Years Ending December 31, 2003 $ 20,903 $ 4,324 $ 25,227 2004 11,681 1,000 12,681 2005 4,508 301 4,809 2006 3,013 3,013 2007 3,092 3,092 Thereafter 8,019 8,019 Total estimated cash outflows $ 51,216 $ 5,625 $ 56,841 31 Table of Contents Restructuring related lease obligations are as follows (in thousands): 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Gross lease obligations $ 22,550 $ 15,150 $ 11,164 $ 10,021 $ 10,078 $ 29,663 $ 98,626 Estimated sublease income(1) (1,647 ) (3,469 ) (6,656 ) (7,008 ) (6,986 ) (21,644 ) (47,410 ) Lease obligations, net $ 20,903 $ 11,681 $ 4,508 $ 3,013 $ 3,092 $ 8,019 $ 51,216 (1) At December 31, 2002, the Company had signed contractual sublease agreements covering $10 million in future payments. Restructuring related and other expenses in 2000 primarily relate to impairments of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in connection with certain of our business acquisitions. Income (Loss) from Operations Our results from operations were income of $64 million and losses of $412 million and $864 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement in operating results in comparison with the prior year was attributable to an increase in gross profit; a reduction in certain operating costs including marketing, technology and content and general and administrative; a decline in restructuring related charges; as well as a decline in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142; offset by stock based compensation charges associated primarily with certain of our employee stock options under variable accounting treatment. We are unable to forecast accurately the effect on our future reported results associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $119 million, $110 million and $90 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest income was $24 million, $29 million and $41 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and interest expense was $143 million, $139 million and $131 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest income declined in 2002 in comparison with 2001 primarily as a result of declining interest rates, offset in part by increases in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income declined in 2001 in comparison with 2000 due primarily to decreases in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense is primarily related to our 6.875% PEACS, 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes), and our Senior Discount Notes. The increase in interest expense for 2001 in comparison with 2000 is primarily associated with our February 2000 issuance of the 6.875% PEACS. At December 31, 2002, our total long term indebtedness was $2.28 billion. Beginning in November 2003, we will begin to make semi annual interest payments on the indebtedness under our Senior Discount Notes. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consisted of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gains on sales of marketable securities, net $ 5,700 $ 1,335 $ 280 Foreign currency transaction losses, net (1,086 ) (2,019 ) (3,250 ) Miscellaneous state, foreign and other taxes 700 (1,222 ) (3,123 ) Other miscellaneous gains (losses), net 309 6 (3,965 ) $ 5,623 $ (1,900 ) $ (10,058 ) 32 Table of Contents Other Gains (Losses), Net Other gains (losses), net consisted of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Foreign currency gains (losses) on 6.875% PEACS $ (103,136 ) $ 46,613 $ Gains (losses) on sales of Euro denominated investments, net 2,227 (22,548 ) Other than temporary impairment losses on equity investments (8,101 ) (43,588 ) (188,832 ) Gains on sales of equity investments, net 13,044 Gains from terminations of commercial contracts 22,400 6,033 Net gains from acquisition of investments by third parties 784 40,160 Warrant remeasurements and other (307 ) (5,802 ) $ (96,273 ) $ (2,141 ) $ (142,639 ) Equity in Losses of Equity Method Investees Equity in losses of equity method investees represents our share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. This influence is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on our investees Board of Directors and the effect of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Equity method losses were $4 million, $30 million and $305 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our basis in equity method investments was less than $1 million, and $10 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As equity method losses are only recorded until the underlying investments are reduced to zero, we expect, absent additional investments, equity method losses in future periods to be insignificant. Income Taxes We have provided for current and deferred U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes for the current and all prior periods presented. Current and deferred income taxes were provided with respect to jurisdictions where certain of our subsidiaries produce taxable income. As of December 31, 2002, we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of $3 million, which consists primarily of certain state jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards. We have provided a valuation allowance for the remainder of our deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty regarding its realization. The increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset was $196 million and $492 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.5 billion related to U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Utilization of net operating losses, which begin to expire at various times starting in 2010, may be subject to certain limitations under Sections 382 and 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other limitations under state and foreign tax laws. Additionally, approximately $180 million of capital loss carryforwards begins to expire in 2005. Approximately $1.2 billion of our net operating loss carryforwards relates to tax deductible stock based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. To the extent that net operating loss carryforwards, if realized, relate to stock based compensation, the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to stockholders equity, rather than to results of operations. Net Loss Net loss was $149 million, $567 million and $1.41 billion for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Year over year improvements during 2002 and 2001 result from a variety of factors, including growth in net 33 Table of Contents sales, overall declines in operating costs (offset by stock based compensation charges associated primarily with certain of our employee stock options under variable accounting treatment), lower impairment charges associated with our investment portfolio and declines in losses from equity method investments, offset by losses arising from the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACSs principal from Euros to U.S. Dollars. Although we reported fourth quarter of 2002 net income of $3 million, we believe that this positive net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not predictive of future results for a variety of reasons. For example, excluding the $5 million restructuring related gain associated with our McDonough, Georgia, fulfillment center lease termination agreement, we would have reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2002. Alternatively, excluding the $31 million stock based compensation charge associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that resulted from an increase in our stock price during the fourth quarter, or excluding the $38 million foreign exchange loss on the remeasurement of our PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars, we would have reported more net income in the fourth quarter of 2002. We are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items, including the stock based compensation charges or credits associated with variable accounting treatment on certain of our employee stock options that will result from fluctuations in our stock price, and the gain or loss associated with our 6.875% PEACS that will result from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Unearned Revenue During 2002 and 2001, activity in unearned revenue was as follows (in thousands): Balance, December 31, 2000 $ 131,117 Cash received or accounts receivable 114,738 Fair value of equity securities received 331 Amortization to revenue (135,808 ) Contract termination (22,400 ) Balance, December 31, 2001 87,978 Cash received or accounts receivable 95,404 Amortization to revenue (135,466 ) Balance, December 31, 2002 $ 47,916 During 2001, we recorded previously unearned revenue associated with the termination of our commercial agreement with Kozmo.com, which was included in Other gains (losses), net. Since services had not yet been performed under the contract, no amounts associated with the Kozmo.com commercial agreement were previously recognized in Net sales during any period. Pro Forma Results of Operations We provide certain pro forma information regarding our results from operations, which excludes the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations: stock based compensation, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and restructuring related and other. 34 Table of Contents We also provide certain pro forma information regarding our net loss, which excludes, in addition to the line items described above, the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations: other gains (losses), net, equity in losses of equity method investees, net, and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. This pro forma information is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Pro forma results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management uses such pro forma measures internally to evaluate our performance, prepare and measure our operating plan and manage our operations. Our management believes pro forma measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because pro forma results exclude certain items that are unpredictable and outside of our control, not settled in cash, or both, such as the effects of foreign exchange rates on Other gains (losses), net, and the effect of the changes in the price of the Companys common stock on Stock based compensation. Other amounts, such as charges associated with our 2001 operational restructuring, are excluded to provide our management and investors information relating to ongoing operations. All pro forma results are derived from information presented in our financial statements. For information about our financial results, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 35 Table of Contents Full year and corresponding quarterly pro forma results of operations, and certain cash flow information for 2002, 2001 and 2000, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2002 Fourth Third Second First Full Year Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Pro forma income from operations $ 180,102 $ 101,958 $ 27,492 $ 25,994 $ 24,658 Pro forma net income (loss) $ 66,487 $ 75,382 $ 353 $ (4,409 ) $ (4,839 ) Pro forma income from operations as a percentage of net sales 5 % 7 % 3 % 3 % 3 % Pro forma basic income (loss) per share $ 0.18 $ 0.20 $ 0.00 $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) Pro forma diluted income (loss) per share $ 0.17 $ 0.19 $ 0.00 $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic income (loss) per share 378,363 383,702 379,650 376,937 373,031 Shares used in computation of pro forma diluted income (loss) per share 399,656 407,056 398,361 376,937 373,031 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 174,291 $ 372,579 $ 38,108 $ 4,637 $ (241,033 ) Year Ended December 31, 2001 Fourth Third Second First Full Year Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Pro forma income (loss) from operations $ (45,002 ) $ 58,680 $ (27,072 ) $ (28,009 ) $ (48,601 ) Pro forma net income (loss) $ (157,031 ) $ 34,785 $ (58,005 ) $ (57,528 ) $ (76,283 ) Pro forma income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales (1 )% 5 % (4 )% (4 )% (7 )% Pro forma basic income (loss) per share $ (0.43 ) $ 0.09 $ (0.16 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.21 ) Pro forma diluted income (loss) per share $ (0.43 ) $ 0.09 $ (0.16 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.21 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic income (loss) per share 364,211 371,420 368,052 359,752 357,424 Shares used in computation of pro forma diluted income (loss) per share 364,211 384,045 368,052 359,752 357,424 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (119,782 ) $ 349,120 $ (64,403 ) $ 2,485 $ (406,984 ) Year Ended December 31, 2000 Fourth Third Second First Full Year Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Pro forma loss from operations $ (317,000 ) $ (59,946 ) $ (68,439 ) $ (89,349 ) $ (99,266 ) Pro forma net loss $ (417,158 ) $ (90,426 ) $ (89,493 ) $ (115,704 ) $ (121,535 ) Pro forma loss from operations as a percentage of net sales (11 )% (6 )% (11 )% (15 )% (17 )% Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share $ (1.19 ) $ (0.25 ) $ (0.25 ) $ (0.33 ) $ (0.35 ) Shares used in computation of pro forma basic and diluted loss per share 350,873 355,681 353,954 349,886 343,884 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (130,442 ) $ 247,653 $ (3,688 ) $ (54,029 ) $ (320,378 ) 36 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of our pro forma results for 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Pro forma net profit for full year 2003 is expected to be over $115 million, or over $0.27 per share. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $738 million, $540 million and $822 million, and our marketable securities balance was $563 million, $456 million and $278 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.30 billion, $997 million and $1.10 billion at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Equity securities of $4 million are included in Marketable securities at December 31, 2002, the value of which may fluctuate significantly. Equity securities of $13 million and $36 million were included in Marketable securities at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We have pledged a portion of our marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, a majority of which relates to property leases; the swap agreement that hedges the foreign exchange rate risk on a portion of our 6.875% PEACS; and some of our real estate lease agreements. The amount of marketable securities we are required to pledge pursuant to the swap agreement fluctuates with the fair market value of the swap obligation.

Long term capital lease obligations are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2002 Gross capital lease obligations $ 9,083 Less imputed interest (592 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 8,491 Less current portion (7,506 ) Long term capital lease obligations $ 985 Net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists of net loss offset by certain adjustments not affecting current period cash flows, and the effect of changes in working capital. Adjustments to net loss to determine cash flows from operations include depreciation and amortization, equity in losses of investees and other items not affecting cash flows in the current period. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 was $174 million, resulting from our net loss of $149 million that was offset by adjustments not affecting 2002 cash flows of $284 million, and changes in working capital of $40 million. Adjustments not affecting 2002 cash flows were primarily associated with losses resulting from the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars, depreciation of fixed assets, stock based compensation and non cash interest expense. Net cash used by operating activities during 2001 was $120 million, resulting from our net loss of $567 million, offset by adjustments not affecting 2001 cash flows of $412 million and changes in working capital of $36 million. Net cash used by operating activities during 2000 was $130 million, resulting from our net loss of $1.41 billion, offset by adjustments not affecting 2000 cash flows of $1.10 billion and changes in working capital of $178 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2002 was $122 million, consisting of net purchases of marketable securities of $83 million and purchases of fixed assets of $39 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2001 was $253 million, consisting of net purchases of marketable securities of 39 Table of Contents $197 million, purchases of fixed assets of $50 million and cash paid for acquired assets of $6 million. Cash provided by investing activities during 2000 was $164 million, consisting of net sales of marketable securities of $361 million offset by cash paid for investments of $63 million and purchases of fixed assets of $135 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2002 was $107 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from exercises of stock options, offset by repayments of long term capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2001 was $107 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to America Online as well as exercises of stock options, offset by repayments of long term capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2000 was $693 million consisting primarily of net proceeds from issuance of 690 million Euros of 6.875% PEACS. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of employee stock options to decline over time as we plan to issue restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee stock based awards. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to have positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less purchases of fixed assets) for fiscal year 2003. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in A rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2002.

Our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments, principal payments, or a combination thereof. The market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $531 million and $310 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $925 million and $625 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the fair value of the outstanding Senior Discount Notes was $263 million and $194 million as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2002, net sales from five of our internationally focused Web sites (www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp and www.amazon.ca) accounted for 30% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales generated from these Web sites, as well as most of the related expenses incurred, are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding Web sites. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp and www.amazon.ca is the same as the local currency of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and Canada, respectively. Results of operations from our foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries that operate our internationally focused Web sites are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations as the financial results of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at average rates prevailing during the year upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. The effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 2002 on our internationally focused Web sites increased net sales by $47 million and increased results from operations by $4 million. At December 31, 2002, we were also exposed to foreign exchange risk related to Euro denominated cash equivalents and marketable securities (Euro Investments), as well as our 6.875% PEACS. As of December 31, 2002 the Euro Investments, classified as available for sale, had a balance of 60 million Euros ($63 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2002). Our 6.875% PEACS have an outstanding principal balance of 690 million Euros ($725 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2002), of which 75 million Euros principal is hedged. Based on the outstanding Euro Investment balance at December 31, 2002, an assumed 5%, 10% and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in a corresponding decline in the total fair value of such investments of approximately $3 million, $6 million and $13 million, respectively. Based on the outstanding (unhedged) 6.875% PEACS principal balance of 615 million Euros at December 31, 2002, an assumed 5%, 10% and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in corresponding currency losses of approximately $32 million, $65 million and $129 million, respectively, recorded to Other gains (losses), net. We hedge the foreign exchange risk on our 6.875% PEACS principal of 75 million Euros and a portion of the interest payments using a cross currency swap agreement. Under the swap agreement, we 42 Table of Contents agreed to pay at inception and receive upon maturity 75 million Euros in exchange for receiving at inception and paying at maturity $67 million. In addition, we agreed to receive in February of each year 27 million Euros corresponding with interest payments on 390 million Euros of the 6.875% PEACS and, simultaneously, to pay $32 million. This agreement is cancelable, in whole or in part, at our option at no cost on or after February 20, 2003 if our common stock price (converted into Euros) is greater than or equal to 84.883 Euros, the minimum conversion price of the 6.875% PEACS. We account for the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on the debt principal and interest. Gains and losses on the swap agreement are initially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our balance sheets and recognized in Other gains (losses), net on our statements of operations upon the recognition of the corresponding currency losses and gains on the remeasurement of the 6.875% PEACS. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2002, our recorded basis in equity securities was $19 million, including $4 million classified as Marketable securities and $15 million classified as Other equity investments. We invest in the stock and or warrants of both private and public companies, including companies with which we have formed commercial relationships, primarily for strategic purposes. At December 31, 2002, we held investments in publicly traded and privately held companies with a recorded basis of $11 million and $8 million, respectively. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During 2002, we recorded impairment losses totaling $8 million to write down several of our equity securities to fair value. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2002 of $42 million (recorded basis of $11 million), an assumed 15%, 30% and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $6 million, $13 million and $21 million, respectively. 43 Table of Contents
