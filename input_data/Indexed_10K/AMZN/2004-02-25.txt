Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section should be read in conjunction with Forward Looking Statements below, as well as Item 1 of Part 1, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results, and Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors and manufacturers and products sold by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize revenue as the seller of record from items we offer from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items offered by third parties. 21 Table of Contents Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. We also seek to minimize shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing consolidated segment operating profit and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in consolidated segment operating profit result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping costs low. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. Our price reductions take several forms: we reduce the sales prices of products we sell, we recruit third party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages, and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement; however, we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Total shares outstanding plus employee stock awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2003 compared to 2002. We leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable cost per unit. Our customer experience costs, specifically the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers, are largely fixed costs. The customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs, credit card processing fees, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and certain aspects of our marketing costs. We focus on maintaining a lean culture by reducing defects in our processes, and obtaining volume discounts from suppliers to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers. Because we are able to turn our inventory quickly, we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 18, 19, and 16 for 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 50, 52, and 49 at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broad band service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase the ubiquity of computers in peoples lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology.  1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of cost of sales to average inventory. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 22 Table of Contents Finally, we want to emphasize that we do not believe that our reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 should be viewed as a material positive event or should be considered predictive of future results. As we discuss in Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Foreign Currencies, had it not been for our decision to settle intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, we would have reported a small net loss for 2003. Also, as our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, our total revenue, profit, and free cash flow has significantly benefited each of the past two years from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our faster growing international websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our fast growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to evaluate our growth rates after the effect of currency changes. For example, although we grew 34% during 2003, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 28%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local currency growth rates. For a description of, and additional information about, each line item summarized below, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general and of the Internet and online commerce, customer spending patterns, world events, the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, risks of inventory management, the degree to which we enter into commercial agreements and strategic transactions and maintain and develop commercial relationships, foreign exchange risks, seasonality, international growth and expansion, and risks of fulfillment, throughput, and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results, which, along with the following discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 23 Table of Contents Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred to the carrier or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; (2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and (3) delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria outlined in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from third party sellers and amounts earned through our Merchant.com program are recognized when the item is sold by the third party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. We also record an allowance, using historical experience, for losses we incur on our payment guarantee from disputes by customers against third party sellers. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered 24 Table of Contents long term investments, where settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were historically recorded to equity as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurement of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income. The effect for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 was to increase net income by $36 million. The effect of this treatment was very significant to our net income for the year and for the quarter. Had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of these intercompany balances, we would have had a net loss for 2003 and our net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 would have been reduced by almost 50%. See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other for further discussion. Restructuring Estimates Restructuring related liabilities include estimates for, among other things, anticipated disposition of lease obligations. Key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals, estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs, and estimates for brokerage and other related costs. Additionally, we may determine that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, may be necessary for our future expansion needs. We periodically evaluate and, if necessary, adjust our estimates based on currently available information. If we elect to utilize this office space, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we will adjust our restructuring related liability and classify future payments to General and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities which were $1.40 billion, $1.30 billion, and $997 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Additionally, we received cash from exercises of employee stock awards of $163 million, $122 million, and $15 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect that stock award exercises will decline as a source of cash as a result of our decision to use restricted stock unit awards as our primary form of stock based compensation. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we held $764 million and $398 million in foreign currencies, primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. During 2003, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were utilized to redeem our 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (10% Senior Discount Notes) and a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes). Total redemption payments, including redemption premiums, totaled $483 million. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and third party sellers, offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services, employee compensation, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers and third party sellers generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels. We generally experience a net cash outflow during the first quarter of each year, as we pay suppliers for inventory that was purchased and sold in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2003, we held $294 million of products in inventories, an increase of $91 million in comparison to the prior year. The increase in inventories corresponds with our efforts to add product categories, increase selection and availability in both existing and new product categories, take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers, and the effect of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, our 25 Table of Contents accounts payable at December 31, 2003 increased $202 million over the prior year end corresponding with increased sales volume. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. In 2003, the U.S. Dollar weakened considerably relative to the Euro resulting in higher U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments. Additionally, in 2003 we began accruing interest on our 10% Senior Discount Notes and paid $2 million of interest when we repaid the full principal amount. We also made interest payments of $3 million associated with the $200 million partial redemption of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes; this payment was otherwise scheduled to be paid in 2004. We currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest payments relating to the 6.875% PEACS, and, as a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with our buying and selling of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software costs. Cash provided by investing activities was $237 million during 2003, while cash used in investing activities was $122 million and $253 million during 2002 and 2001. Our capital expenditures were $46 million, $39 million, and $50 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of cash proceeds from exercises of stock options, repayment of long term debt, and repayment of capital lease obligations. Cash used in financing activities was $332 million during 2003 resulting primarily from repayments of long term debt obligations. Cash provided by financing activities was $107 million during 2002 and 2001. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of employee stock options to decline over time as we plan to continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee stock based awards. In January 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. In addition to this debt repurchase program, on February 26, 2004, we will redeem $150 million of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Restructuring related commitments: Operating leases, net of estimated sublease income $ 9,577 $ 4,998 $ 3,421 $ 3,356 $ 2,691 $ 5,300 $ 29,343 Other 897 300 1,197 Restructuring related commitments 10,474 5,298 3,421 3,356 2,691 5,300 30,540 Other commitments: Debt principal and other (1)(2) 3,013 74 246 1,931,160 1,934,493 Debt interest (1)(2) 109,656 109,656 109,656 109,656 109,656 144,517 692,797 Capital leases 1,678 868 341 2,887 Operating leases (3) 51,498 43,323 42,391 39,100 38,181 131,040 345,533 Purchase obligations (4) 187,881 187,881 Other commitments 353,726 153,921 152,388 148,756 148,083 2,206,717 3,163,591 Total commitments $ 364,200 $ 159,219 $ 155,809 $ 152,112 $ 150,774 $ 2,212,017 $ 3,194,131 (1) The principal payment due in 2010 and the annual interest payments due under our 6.875% PEACS fluctuate based on the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.260. Due to 26 Table of Contents fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our principal debt obligation under this instrument since issuance has increased by $197 million through December 31, 2003. We cannot predict the performance of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. (2) See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 Subsequent Events. (3) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2003, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate of $346 million. If we had applied to our equipment related operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $76 million of additional assets and obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2003. (4) Consists of legally binding commitments to purchase inventory. Legally binding commitments associated with non inventory purchases are not significant. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position (and our Board of Directors has authorized the debt repurchase program discussed above). The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. We do not currently have a line of credit, and there can be no assurance that lines of credit or other financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations Segment Operating Income (Loss) Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (amounts in thousands) Segment Operating Income: North America $ 283,045 $ 179,667 $ 57,501 International 78,193 435 (102,503 ) Consolidated $ 361,238 $ 180,102 $ (45,002 ) Year over year improvement: North America 58 % 212 % International 17,875 N/A Consolidated 101 N/A Segment Operating Margin: North America 9 % 7 % 2 % International 4 0 (15 ) Consolidated 7 5 (1 ) The key drivers in the year over year improvement in segment operating income are revenue growth and efficiencies in our fulfillment process. Revenue growth was driven, in part, by lowering prices, including increased adoption by our customers of our free shipping offers. Operating expenses in our North America and International segments increased $22 million and $61 million, or 4% and 24% in 2003 in comparison to the prior year. The increases in segment operating expenses were primarily related to variable costs, including fulfillment related costs for picking, packaging, and shipping our products to customers, and credit card fees, offset by reductions in most other expense categories. Segment operating expenses represented 18% and 16% of net sales for North America and International segments, compared with 20% and 21% in the prior year. The year over year 27 Table of Contents declines in segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales result from leveraging the fixed cost portion of our operations over increased volume. See Net Sales and Gross Profit below for additional information about increases in our sales volume. In 2002, improvements in our income (loss) from operations over the prior year were also significantly affected by the decline in amortization charges, primarily relating to the required adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and lower restructuring related charges. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net Sales North America Media $ 2,269,472 $ 1,994,949 $ 1,810,175 Electronics and other general merchandise 878,519 681,041 577,524 Other 110,422 85,467 72,637 Total North America 3,258,413 2,761,457 2,460,336 International Media 1,779,476 1,103,665 645,453 Electronics and other general merchandise 224,606 65,877 16,134 Other 1,204 1,937 510 Total International 2,005,286 1,171,479 662,097 Consolidated Media 4,048,948 3,098,614 2,455,628 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,103,125 746,918 593,658 Other 111,626 87,404 73,147 Total consolidated $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 $ 3,122,433 Net Sales Growth Rate North America Media 14 % 10 % Electronics and other general merchandise 29 18 Other 29 18 Total North America 18 12 International Media 61 71 Electronics and other general merchandise 241 308 Other (38 ) 280 Total International 71 77 Consolidated Media 31 26 Electronics and other general merchandise 48 26 Other 28 19 Total Consolidated 34 26 Consolidated Revenue Mix Media 77 % 79 % 79 % Electronics and other general merchandise 21 19 19 Other 2 2 2 Total Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue growth is due to increased demand, which was driven by increased selection, lower prices, including from our free shipping offers, and improved features and services available on our websites, including 28 Table of Contents our Amazon Marketplace and Merchant@ programs. Revenues improved $232 million and $47 million in 2003 and 2002 in comparison to the preceding years due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the U.S. Dollar weakened. The future growth of our International segment, measured in U.S. Dollars, may fluctuate significantly with changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results We Have Foreign Exchange Risk. We also anticipate that, as the revenue base of our International segment increases, the percentage growth rates in local currency will likely decline over time. Sales of products by third party sellers on our websites continue to increase. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they result in lower revenues but higher gross margins per unit, as there are no associated costs classified within cost of sales, unless we perform fulfillment services. To the extent product sales by third party sellers continue to increase, we anticipate improvement in gross margin, offset to the extent we offer additional or broader price reductions, free shipping offers, and other promotions. Gross profit is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Gross Profit North America $ 866,664 $ 740,985 $ 657,229 International 390,504 251,633 141,329 Consolidated $ 1,257,168 $ 992,618 $ 798,558 Gross Profit Growth Rate North America 17 % 13 % International 55 78 Consolidated 27 24 Gross Margin North America 27 % 27 % 27 % International 19 21 21 Consolidated 24 25 26 The increases in gross profit in comparison with the prior years corresponds with increased revenue, offset by our year round free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our mix of sales during the year, sales volumes by third party sellers, competitive pricing decisions, changes in vendor pricing, and general efforts to reduce prices for our customers over time, as well as the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers. These free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. In particular, we commenced offering free super saver delivery in the U.K. in 2003, and this decision decreased the gross margins for our International segment. We view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them. Gross profit in 2003 benefited $46 million in comparison to 2002 due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the U.S. Dollar weakened. Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Supplemental Information Shipping Activity Shipping revenue $ 372,000 $ 364,749 $ 357,325 Net shipping cost (136,468 ) (39,554 ) (19,163 ) We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping alternatives that result in a net cost to us in delivering products. We seek to 29 Table of Contents offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes and better operating efficiencies and by negotiating better terms with our suppliers. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs were $477 million, $392 million, and $374 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 9%, 10%, and 12% of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in comparison with the prior year primarily relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and our mix of product sales. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of our products. The improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales results from improvements in productivity and accuracy, the increase in units fulfilled, which leverages the fixed cost portion of our fulfillment network, efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties, a decline in customer service contacts per order resulting from improvements in our operations, and enhancements to our customer self service features available on our websites. These improvements were offset, in part, by credit card fees associated with third party seller transactions, which represent a significant percentage relative to commission amounts earned, and as a result negatively affect fulfillment as a percentage of net sales. Marketing Marketing expenses, net of co operative marketing reimbursements, were $123 million, $125 million, and $138 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 2%, 3%, and 4% of net sales. Although we do not expect them to do so, if co operative marketing reimbursements decline in future periods, we may incur additional expenses to continue certain promotions or elect to reduce or discontinue them. We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of online marketing channels, including our Syndicated Stores and Associates programs, which enable associated websites to make our products available to their audiences with fulfillment performed by us. Under these arrangements, we pay a sales commission on product sales, which is classified as Marketing on our consolidated statements of operations. Declines in expense for marketing related activities reflect management efforts to cut ineffective marketing programs, as well as reduced rates charged to us for some online marketing activities. These decreases are partially offset by increased investment in marketing channels considered most effective in driving incremental net sales, such as targeted online advertising through various Web portals and our Associates program. We expect absolute dollars spent in marketing to increase in 2004. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses were $208 million, $216 million, and $241 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 4%, 5%, and 8% of net sales. The decline in absolute dollars spent for 2003 primarily reflects improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories, offset by increases in employee related costs. The decline in absolute dollars spent for 2002 primarily reflects our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a less costly technology infrastructure. We expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase during 2004 as we continue to hire more computer scientists and software engineers, however as a percentage of net sales, we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $88 million, $79 million, and $90 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 2% of net sales for 2003 and 2002, and 3% of net sales for 2001. We generally expect administrative costs to increase over time commensurate with the increasing size and complexity of our business. In 2004, we expect ongoing general and administrative costs to increase in absolute terms, however as a percentage of net sales, we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline. 30 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation was $88 million, $69 million, and $5 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. In late 2002, we began issuing restricted stock units as our primary form of stock based compensation. Previously, we primarily issued at the money stock options. In certain of our foreign jurisdictions, we continue to grant stock options. At December 31, 2003, we had 30 million stock awards outstanding, including 25 million stock options, which had a weighted average exercise price of $12.46; 4 million restricted stock units; and 1 million shares of restricted stock. Common shares outstanding, which includes restricted stock, plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units, totaled 433 million at December 31, 2003, flat with the prior year. For additional information about our stock based compensation and awards, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies, and Note 8 Stockholders Deficit. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $3 million, $5 million, and $181 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. Goodwill is no longer amortized, in accordance with GAAP, and based on the current balance of intangibles, absent any additional investment, amortization of intangibles will not be significant going forward. Restructuring Related and Other Cash payments resulting from our January 2001 operational restructuring were $26 million and $45 million for 2003 and 2002. Based on currently available information, we estimate the remaining restructuring related cash outflows will be as follows (in thousands): Leases Other Total Years Ending December 31, 2004 $ 9,577 $ 897 $ 10,474 2005 4,998 300 5,298 2006 3,421 3,421 2007 3,356 3,356 2008 2,691 2,691 Thereafter 5,300 5,300 Total estimated cash outflows (1) $ 29,343 $ 1,197 $ 30,540 (1) Cash flows are presented net of an estimated $39 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2003 we have signed sublease agreements totaling $15 million. For additional information about our January 2001 operational restructuring, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Restructuring Related and Other. Net Interest Expense We generally invest our excess cash in A rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them. The primary components of our interest expense relate to our debt instruments. During 2003, we redeemed our 10% Senior Discount Notes and we redeemed a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. At December 31, 2003, our total long term indebtedness was $1.95 billion. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other and Note 17 Subsequent Events. 31 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was a gain of $3 million and $6 million for 2003 and 2002, and a loss of $2 million in 2001. These amounts consist of gains on sales of marketable securities; state, foreign, and other taxes; and miscellaneous non operating gains and losses. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11 Other Income (Expense), Net for additional information. Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other consisted of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Foreign currency gain (loss) on 6.875% PEACS (1) $ (140,130 ) $ (103,136 ) $ 46,613 Loss on redemption of long term debt (2) (23,829 ) Foreign currency effect on intercompany balances (3) 35,574 Other than temporary impairments and other (4) (1,276 ) 6,863 (48,754 ) Total remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other $ (129,661 ) $ (96,273 ) $ (2,141 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other for additional information on repayments of long term debt in 2003. (3) Represents the gain associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates (See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Foreign Currencies). In future periods, remeasurement of intercompany balances that remain outstanding will result in gains or losses being recorded to Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other on our consolidated statements of operations. (4) Includes a $6 million loss relating to the termination of our Euro Currency Swap in 2003. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other for additional information on the termination of our Euro Currency Swap. As a result of this termination, any fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange will have a greater effect on our interest expense. Income Taxes Subject to certain limitations, we have approximately $2.9 billion of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire at various times starting in 2010. Approximately $1.6 billion of our net operating loss carryforwards relates to tax deductible stock based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. To the extent that net operating loss carryforwards, if realized, relate to stock based compensation, the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to stockholders equity, rather than to results of operations. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Income Taxes for additional information. Net Income (Loss) Although we reported net income for the year ended 2003, we believe that this net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not necessarily predictive of future reported results for a variety of reasons. For example, had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of the intercompany balances during the fourth quarter, we would have had a small net loss for the year and our net income for the fourth quarter would have been reduced by almost 50%. Additionally, we are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items, including the stock based compensation associated with variable accounting treatment and the gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances that results from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These items represented significant quarterly charges and gains during 2003 and may result in significant charges or gains in future periods. 32 Table of Contents Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue was $38 million and $48 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Unearned revenue represents payments received by us in advance of our service obligations. As we continue to structure our agreements to align the timing of our cash receipts with the service provided, we expect that, over time, balances of unearned revenue may continue to decline. We believe this trend in unearned revenue is not significant relative to the trend in our cash flows or operating results. See Net Sales and Gross Profit above. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: consolidated segment operating income (loss), pro forma net income (loss), pro forma net earnings (loss) per share, and free cash flow. We use these non GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons. These non GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. For a quantitative reconciliation of our non GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation Tables below. Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes: Stock based compensation; Amortization of other intangibles; and Restructuring related and other. These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income (loss), which we reconcile to GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment 33 Table of Contents operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non GAAP financial measures. We use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both. Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Stock Based Compensation We exclude stock based compensation for the following reasons: Stock based compensation expense is excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance, although we consider the dilutive impact to our investors when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly; Stock based compensation charges or gains are non cash; and The measurement of stock based compensation is determined under a variety of methods depending on the underlying award. These methods include: (a) fixed accounting on stock options granted at market prices, resulting in no compensation expense, (b) variable accounting on certain stock options and restricted stock units, resulting in unpredictable charges or gains beyond our control, and (c) fixed accounting for certain restricted stock units, resulting in the estimated fair value of the award recognized over the service period. We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock based awards in Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and content, and General and administrative on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in Stock based compensation. Amortization of Other Intangibles We exclude Amortization of other intangibles for the following reasons: Amortization of other intangibles is excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance; Amortization of other intangibles is a non cash charge to current operations; and Amortization of other intangibles has diminished, is currently immaterial, and is scheduled to fully amortize by the end of 2004. Restructuring Related and Other We exclude restructuring related and other expenses, which are cash and non cash amounts, for the following reasons: We have implemented only one restructuring event in our history, which we announced in January 2001, and accordingly we believe internally that this line item is not as important to understanding our quarterly trends as other line items; Since we do not regularly have restructuring related charges, the exclusion of such charges from prior periods provides better comparability of our results of operations as viewed by management; and Our restructuring related and other charges have diminished, and except for periodic adjustments to our estimates that may be required from time to time, we do not currently expect to record additional restructuring related charges in the foreseeable future. 34 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would be non cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the year ended December 31, 2003. Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because it excludes Stock based compensation, the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements. See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies for presentation of our stock based compensation expense calculated on a consistent basis for all awards using the fair value method as prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as well as total outstanding stock based awards and related activity. Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes Restructuring related and other. For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Restructuring Related and Other. There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based on those future facts and circumstances at that time. Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss), including the related pro forma net earnings (loss) per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations: Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other; Equity in losses of equity method investees, net; and Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. We use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both. Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) See Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) for an explanation of Stock based compensation, Amortization of other intangibles, Restructuring related and other, and Impairment of goodwill. 35 Table of Contents Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other The majority of Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. This line item also includes $24 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10% Senior Discount Notes and a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and $6 million of losses associated with the termination of our Euro Currency Swap. Equity in Losses of Equity Method Investees, Net We exclude equity in losses of equity method investees, net, because it generates potential non cash gains or losses, which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Finally, in recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Long Term Debt and Other. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Limitations of Free Cash Flow Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

For the full year 2004, net sales are expected to be between $6.20 billion and $6.70 billion. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Assuming among other things, and solely for purposes of this estimate, that we do not record any revisions to our restructuring related estimates and that the closing price of our common stock on March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2004 is identical to the closing price of $52.62 on December 31, 2003, operating income for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be between $80 million and $100 million, and, for the full year of 2004, to be between $355 million and $455 million. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. In addition, our GAAP operating projections are based on an assumption about our future stock price performance, which is required to estimate stock based compensation and is difficult to accurately predict. First quarter of 2004 consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between $95 million and $115 million. For the full year 2004, consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between $430 million and $530 million. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in A rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2003. Amounts were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value at December 31, 2003 Commercial paper and short term obligations $ 675,061 $ $ $ $ $ $ 675,061 $ 675,061 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % 2.00 % Certificates of deposit 27,395 27,395 27,395 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % 2.00 % Corporate notes and bonds 11,280 2,000 8,520 2,330 24,130 24,997 Weighted average interest rate 1.34 % 1.51 % 1.96 % 1.96 % 1.68 % Asset backed and agency securities 20,700 18,875 30,370 14,440 84,385 85,692 Weighted average interest rate 1.22 % 1.88 % 2.03 % 2.32 % 1.83 % Treasury notes and bonds 4,000 6,751 95,770 37,600 144,121 145,778 Weighted average interest rate 1.12 % 1.59 % 1.50 % 2.12 % 1.96 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 738,436 $ 27,626 $ 134,660 $ 54,370 $ $ $ 955,092 $ 958,923 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2002.

Our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of periodic interest payments and principal payments at maturity. The market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $870 million and $531 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.06 billion (principal balance of $1.05 billion) and $925 million (principal balance of $1.25 billion) at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2003, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, and www.amazon.co.jp) accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca, are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites, and include Euros, British Pounds, Yen, and Canadian Dollars. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant transaction gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2003, International segment revenues improved $226 million and our operating results improved $15 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2003 of $764 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $38 million, $76 million, and $153 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance of 690 million Euros ($870 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2003). Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACSs principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in losses of approximately $43 million, $87 million, and $174 million, recorded to Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other. We are not hedged on interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 15% in 2004, we would incur $2 million, $4 million, and $6 million additional interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2003, our recorded basis in equity securities was $23 million, including $9 million classified as Marketable securities and $15 million classified as Other equity investments. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During 2003, we recorded impairment losses totaling $2 million, compared to $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, to write down several of our equity securities to fair value. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2003 of $86 million (recorded basis of $16 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $13 million, $26 million and $43 million. 42 Table of Contents
