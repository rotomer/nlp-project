Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the 25 Table of Contents amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results, which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors, publishers, and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. Our price reductions take several forms: we reduce the sales prices of products we sell, we recruit third party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages, and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 434 million at December 31, 2004, compared with 433 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002. We seek to leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable costs per unit. Our customer experience costs, specifically the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers, are largely fixed in that they do not vary directly with sales. The customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs; credit card processing fees; bad debt; picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment; transportation; customer service support; and most aspects of our marketing costs. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing; seek to maximize volume discounts available to us from suppliers; and focus on maintaining a lean culture, including by reducing defects in our processes. 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 26 Table of Contents Because we are able to turn our inventory quickly, we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 16, 18, 19 for 2004, 2003, and 2002. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third party sales, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 53, 50, and 52 for 2004, 2003 and 2002. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third party sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results, including trends. For example, our total revenue, profit, and operating and free cash flow have recently benefited significantly from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our internationally focused websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to also evaluate our growth rates before the effect of currency changes. For example, while our revenues increased 31% during 2004 in comparison with the prior year, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 26%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local currency growth rates. We may have significant variation in our future reported results. We believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed, on its own, as a material positive event, and the year over year increase in net income of $553 million is not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2004 we had a primarily non cash net benefit from income taxes of $233 million resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities (PEACS) and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and changes in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and  2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 27 Table of Contents liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Under our Syndicated Stores arrangements, we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory, set prices, and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service, and the other business earns a sales commission. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for online DVD rentals and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from third party sellers and similar amounts earned through our Merchant.com program are recognized when the item is sold by the third party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. 28 Table of Contents Outbound shipping charges to customers are included in Net sales and, excluding amounts earned from third party sellers where we dont provide fulfillment services, amounted to $420 million, $372 million, and $365 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment related services in connection with certain of our Merchants@ and Merchant.com programs. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third party maintains ownership of the related products. Internal Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. In accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal use software are expensed as incurred. During 2004, 2003, and 2002 we capitalized $44 million, $30 million, and $25 million of costs associated with development of internal use software, which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $30 million, $24 million, and $26 million. Restructuring Estimates Restructuring related liabilities include estimates for, among other things, anticipated disposition of lease obligations. Key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals, estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs, and estimates for brokerage and other related costs. We periodically evaluate and, if necessary, adjust our estimates based on currently available information. Additionally, we may determine, as we did in 2004, that certain of the office space vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, may be necessary for our future needs. To the extent we elect to utilize this office space, we adjust our restructuring related liability and classify future payments to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered long term investments, in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders deficit as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation, any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net 29 Table of Contents income. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets. Resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates, we recorded gains of $41 million and $36 million for 2004 and 2003. Repayments among the entities during 2004 were $210 million. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax assets are $363 million, comprised of approximately $270 million relating to our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting. Classification of deferred tax assets between current and long term categories is based on the expected timing of realization, and the valuation allowance is allocated on a pro rata basis. We had a net tax benefit in 2004 of $233 million resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004. In connection with this assessment, we also recorded a net credit to Stockholders Deficit of $106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004. The range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide. For example, had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that a portion of our deferred tax asset will be realized, the amount recorded to Provision (benefit) for income taxes would have been an expense of $12 million (rather than a benefit of $233 million) for 2004. Alternatively, if we had concluded that the weight of available evidence supported a decision that substantially all of our deferred tax assets may be realized, we would have recorded a substantially larger credit to Stockholders Deficit. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and it is very difficult to predict when, if ever, our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow was $477 million for 2004 compared to $346 million for 2003, an increase of 38%. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of expense payments, discounts offered by vendors, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion at the end of 2004 and 2003. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $970 million and $764 million at the end of 2004 and 2003, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $567 million, $392 million, and $174 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and third party sellers, offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services, employee compensation, credit card transaction fees, bad debt, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 30 Table of Contents customers and third party sellers generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels. During 2004, payments to product merchandise suppliers, which do not include payments to transportation suppliers, totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion over the prior year. The increase in payments to product merchandise suppliers corresponds with cost of sales, and with our efforts to add product categories, increase selection of products we offer for sale, improve availability in both existing and new product categories, and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers, and is also affected by foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development costs. Cash used in investing activities was $318 million in 2004 and $122 in 2002, while cash provided by investing activities was $237 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by maturities of marketable securities. Our capital expenditures, including internal use software and website development, were $89 million, $46 million, and $39 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites over time. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. In September 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Joyo.com at a purchase price of $75 million, including a cash payment (net of cash acquired) of $71 million, the assumption of employee stock options, and transaction related costs. Cash paid in connection with this acquisition is classified as cash provided by (used in) investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. The operating results of Joyo.com did not have a significant effect on consolidated results for 2004. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Business Acquisition. Cash used in financing activities was $97 million in 2004 and $332 million in 2003. This compares to cash provided by financing activities of $107 million in 2002. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, which were $60 million in 2004, $163 million in 2003, and $122 million for 2002. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock based awards. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations, which were $157 million in 2004, $495 million in 2003, and $15 million in 2002. During 2004, we paid $154 million, which includes a redemption premium of $4 million, to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes). See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt and Other. In 2004 we recorded a primarily non cash net benefit of $233 million to Provision (benefit) for income taxes relating primarily to our valuation of deferred tax assets. We expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately $25 million, compared with $4 million in 2004. On March 7, 2005, we redeemed 200 million Euros principal of our 6.875% PEACS for a cash payment of $266 million, which includes $1 million of interest from and including February 16 through March 6, 2005. Under the Indenture, no premium was required. As of March 7, 2005, the outstanding principal amount of our 6.875% PEACS was 490 million Euros ($649 million using the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate on that date). Additionally, in March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. 31 Table of Contents Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. We currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest or principal obligations relating to the 6.875% PEACS, and, as a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro denominated interest payable are classified as Other expense (income), net on our consolidated statements of operations. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2004: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal and other (1) $ 128 $ 1,250 $ 340 $ 373 $ 899,760 $ 951,089 $ 1,852,940 Debt interest (1) 107,026 107,026 107,026 107,026 85,656 64,287 578,047 Capital leases 1,298 510 22 1,830 Operating leases (2) 61,222 64,390 55,678 51,990 43,184 186,737 463,201 Purchase obligations (3) 227,950 227,950 Total operating and capital commitments 397,624 173,176 163,066 159,389 1,028,600 1,202,113 3,123,968 Restructuring related commitments: Operating leases, net of estimated sublease income (4) 3,057 1,903 1,843 1,497 1,374 1,305 10,979 Other 1,910 1,910 Total restructuring related commitments 4,967 1,903 1,843 1,497 1,374 1,305 12,889 Total commitments $ 402,591 $ 175,079 $ 164,909 $ 160,886 $ 1,029,974 $ 1,203,418 $ 3,136,857 (1) The principal payment due in 2010 and the annual interest payments due under our 6.875% PEACS fluctuate based on the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which, at December 31, 2004, was 1.3552. As of December 31, 2004, our principal debt obligation for the 6.875% PEACS has increased by $255 million since its issuance in February 2000 due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio. Additionally, on March 7, 2005, we redeemed 200 million Euros of our outstanding 6.875% PEACS, which is not reflected in the table above. (2) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2004, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate of $463 million. If we had applied to our operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $335 million of additional obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2004. (3) Consists primarily of legally binding commitments to purchase inventory. Legally binding commitments associated with non inventory purchases are not significant. (4) Net of an estimated $20 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2004, we had signed sublease agreements totaling $13 million. 32 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge a portion of our marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements. The amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases; with fluctuations in our market capitalization, which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock; and based on our credit rating. The change in the total amount of collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: StandbyLetters ofCredit (1) Line ofCredit (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 60,799 $ $ 25,936 $ 86,735 Net change in collateral pledged (10,383 ) 1,933 (4,412 ) (12,862 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 (4) $ 50,416 $ 1,933 $ 21,524 $ 73,873 (1) Pursuant to available standby letter of credit facilities totaling $151 million. (2) Pursuant to an available line of credit totaling $10 million. (3) The required amount of collateral to be pledged on certain of our real estate leases fluctuates based on our market capitalization. At December 31, 2004, our market capitalization was $18.1 billion. If our market capitalization decreases, the required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase $5 million (if market capitalization is less than $18 billion but more than $13 billion) or $11 million (if our market capitalization is less than $13 billion). (4) Includes $10 million of cash equivalents pledged as collateral. See Note 2 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. 33 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net Sales: North America $ 3,847,344 $ 3,258,413 $ 2,761,457 International 3,073,780 2,005,286 1,171,479 Consolidated $ 6,921,124 $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 Net Sales Growth Rate: North America 18.1 % 18.0 % 12.2 % International 53.3 71.2 76.9 Consolidated 31.5 33.8 26.0 Net Sales Mix: North America 55.6 % 61.9 % 70.2 % International 44.4 38.1 29.8 Consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Revenue growth is due primarily to increased demand driven by increased selection, lower prices, including from our free shipping offers, and improved features and services available on our websites. Revenue growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates. See Effect of Exchange Rates below for additional information on the effect on reported revenue of changes in exchange rates. Net sales from Other consist of non retail activities, such as our Merchant.com program, miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities, and our co branded credit card program. North America revenue growth rate in 2004 was consistent with 2003 at 18%, up from our 2002 growth rate of 12%. The increase in growth rates from 2002 reflects our efforts to increase product categories and selection available on our websites, and to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International revenue growth rate declined in 2004 and 2003 compared to the prior year periods, which reflects several factors. These factors include the increasing size of our business, which naturally causes growth rates to decline over time, offset by our customer experience initiatives including new category introductions; increased selection; the introduction of our third party offerings in the UK, Germany, Japan, and France; and our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International segment revenue growth rates are also affected by changes in exchange rates. The relative mix of worldwide net sales attributed to our International segment continues to increase, and we expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated total. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines in our Electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. 34 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,023,552 $ 866,664 $ 740,985 International 578,445 390,504 251,633 Consolidated $ 1,601,997 $ 1,257,168 $ 992,618 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 18.1 % 17.0 % 12.7 % International 48.1 55.2 78.0 Consolidated 27.4 26.7 24.3 Gross Margin: North America 26.6 % 26.6 % 26.8 % International 18.8 19.5 21.5 Consolidated 23.1 23.9 25.2 The increases in gross profit in absolute terms during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior year periods correspond with increased revenue, including from increased sales volume by third party sellers, offset by our year round free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product and geographic mix of sales during the year; sales volumes by third party sellers; changes in vendor pricing; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers. Free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Additionally, in 2005, we introduced a new shipping membership program, Amazon Prime, in which members receive free two day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. North America segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003, with each of these years down slightly from 2002. Changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers, including from our year round free shipping offers, were offset partially by increased sales volume by third party sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers. International segment gross margins declined during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior periods resulting from our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers, and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories, offset partially by increases in sales volume by third party sellers. Sales of products by third party sellers on our websites continue to increase, representing 26%, 22%, and 17% of unit sales in 2004, 2003, and 2002. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. If product sales by third party sellers continue to increase, we anticipate the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will partially offset the effect on our gross margins of our strategy to lower prices for customers over time by offering additional or broader price reductions, free shipping offers, and other promotions. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates. See Effect of Exchange Rates below for additional information on the effect on reported gross profit of changes in exchange rates. 35 Table of Contents Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue $ 420,053 $ 372,000 $ 364,749 Outbound shipping costs (616,572 ) (508,468 ) (404,303 ) Net shipping cost $ (196,519 ) $ (136,468 ) $ (39,554 ) We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products. Additionally, in 2005, we continued to lower prices, including by introducing a new shipping membership program, Amazon Prime, in which members receive free two day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. We seek to partially offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies, including by reducing split shipments. 36 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net Sales: North America Media $ 2,589,438 $ 2,269,472 $ 1,994,949 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,127,754 878,519 681,041 Other 130,152 110,422 85,467 Total North America $ 3,847,344 $ 3,258,413 $ 2,761,457 International Media $ 2,512,911 $ 1,779,476 $ 1,103,665 Electronics and other general merchandise 558,490 224,606 65,877 Other 2,379 1,204 1,937 Total International $ 3,073,780 $ 2,005,286 $ 1,171,479 Consolidated Media $ 5,102,349 $ 4,048,948 $ 3,098,614 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,686,244 1,103,125 746,918 Other 132,531 111,626 87,404 Total consolidated $ 6,921,124 $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 Net Sales Growth Rate: North America Media 14.1 % 13.8 % 10.2 % Electronics and other general merchandise 28.4 29.0 17.9 Other 17.9 29.2 17.7 Total North America 18.1 18.0 12.2 International Media 41.2 % 61.2 % 71.0 % Electronics and other general merchandise 148.7 240.9 308.3 Other 97.6 (37.8 ) 279.8 Total International 53.3 71.2 76.9 Consolidated Media 26.0 % 30.7 % 26.2 % Electronics and other general merchandise 52.9 47.7 25.8 Other 18.7 27.7 19.5 Total consolidated 31.5 33.8 26.0 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 73.7 % 76.9 % 78.8 % Electronics and other general merchandise 24.4 21.0 19.0 Other 1.9 2.1 2.2 Total consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % North America 55.6 % 61.9 % 70.2 % International 44.4 38.1 29.8 Total consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 37 Table of Contents Direct Segment Operating Expenses Information about the operating expense categories that we allocate to our segment results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Segment Operating Expenses: North America $ 702,676 $ 583,619 $ 561,318 International 409,158 312,311 251,198 Percent of Net Sales: North America 18.3 % 17.9 % 20.3 % International 13.3 15.6 21.4 Segment Operating Expenses: Fulfillment (1) $ 590,397 $ 477,032 $ 392,467 Marketing (2) 158,022 122,787 125,383 Technology and content (3) 251,195 207,809 215,617 General and administrative (4) 112,220 88,302 79,049 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment (1) 8.5 % 9.1 % 10.0 % Marketing (2) 2.3 2.3 3.2 Technology and content (3) 3.6 3.9 5.5 General and administrative (4) 1.6 1.7 2.0 Year over year Percentage Change: Fulfillment (1) 24 % 22 % 5 % Marketing (2) 29 (2 ) (9 ) Technology and content (3) 21 (4 ) (11 ) General and administrative (4) 27 12 (12 ) (1) Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in comparison with the prior year relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume; our mix of product sales; costs associated with credit card fees; and bad debt costs, including costs of our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell. Additionally, since credit card fees associated with third party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and bad debt costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our increasing third party sales result in increasing fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. Also, during the third quarter of 2004 we began operation of a new European fulfillment center in Scotland and plan to expand our fulfillment capacity in Japan in 2005. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales decreased due to improvements in productivity and accuracy, the increase in units fulfilled, which leverages the fixed cost portion of our fulfillment network, efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties, a decline in customer service contacts per unit resulting from improvements in our operations, and enhancements to our customer self service features, offset partially by increases in credit card fees and bad debt, including costs of our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions. We expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment to increase over time. (2) Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, portal advertising, e mail campaigns, and other initiatives. Since our marketing expenses are largely variable, we expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing 38 Table of Contents expense. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2004 corresponding with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping as an effective worldwide marketing tool, and intend to continue offering it indefinitely. (3) Technology and Content Our spending in technology and content has increased as we are adding computer scientists and software engineers to continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and to improve our process efficiency. Additionally, we continue to invest in several areas of technology, including seller platform; A9.com, our wholly owned subsidiary focused on search technology on www.A9.com, www.amazon.com, and other Amazon sites; web services; and digital initiatives. During 2004, 2003, and 2002 we capitalized $44 million, $30 million, and $25 million of costs associated with development of internal use software, which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $30 million, $24 million, and $26 million. We intend to continue investing in these and other initiatives and expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff. A significant majority of these costs are incurred in the United States and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. (4) General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative is primarily due to increases in professional fees and litigation costs. We expect absolute dollars spent in general and administrative to increase over time. On an annual basis in 2004, each category of direct segment operating expenses has either declined or remained flat with 2003 as a percentage of net sales. However, for the fourth quarter of 2004 expenses for Marketing and Technology and content as a percentage of net sales increased in comparison to same period in 2003, and this trend may continue. Stock Based Compensation On October 13, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on the effective date for SFAS No. 123R (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS 123R requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value beginning on July 1, 2005, however we will early adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R with an implementation date of January 1, 2005. The adoption of this standard will not affect the stock based compensation associated with our restricted stock and restricted stock units which are already recorded at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period, but will result in the recognition of stock based compensation in future periods for remaining unvested stock options as of the effective date. As of the implementation date of this standard, we will no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. We estimate that stock based compensation for 2005 will be $115 million. See also Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting PoliciesStock based Compensation for our SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosures using fair value accounting treatment. 39 Table of Contents Stock based compensation consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Stock awards variable accounting (1) $ 4,577 $ 51,875 $ 60,130 Fixed accounting (2): Restricted stock units (3) 48,625 30,691 3,913 Restricted stock (4) 4,500 5,185 4,884 Total stock based compensation $ 57,702 $ 87,751 $ 68,927 (1) Variable accounting treatment results in expense or contra expense recognition using the cumulative expense method, calculated based on the quoted price of our common stock and vesting schedules of underlying awards. To the extent stock options are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock based compensation. (2) The fair value of awards is determined at grant date based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the accelerated method under FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. To the extent awards are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation. (3) Since October 2002, we have awarded restricted stock units as our primary form of stock based compensation. (4) Includes expense associated with matching contributions of 0.07 million and 0.03 million shares of our common stock under our 401(k) savings plan during 2004 and 2003. No matching contributions were made in 2002. At December 31, 2004, we had 25 million stock awards outstanding, including 18 million stock options with a $12.98 weighted average exercise price; 6 million restricted stock units; and 1 million shares of restricted stock. Common shares outstanding (which include restricted stock) plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units totaled 434 million and 433 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. For additional information about our stock based compensation and awards see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock based Compensation. Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense (income) was $(8) million, $3 million, and $47 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, which includes restructuring related expenses (credits) and amortization of other intangibles. Restructuring related expenses (credits) were $(9) million, $0 million, and $42 million; and amortization of other intangibles was $1 million, $3 million, and $5 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, was necessary for our future needs. We have reduced our restructuring related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million in 2004. Lease related payments for this office space, approximately $0.8 million per quarter, are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. These efforts were primarily focused on eliminating French office positions in managerial, professional, clerical, and technical roles. The number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in Other operating expense (income) on the consolidated statements of operations. 40 Table of Contents Cash payments resulting from our operational restructurings were $9 million, $26 million, and $45 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Based on currently available information, we estimate the remaining restructuring related cash outflows will be as follows: Leases Other Total (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2005 $ 3,057 $ 1,910 $ 4,967 2006 1,903 1,903 2007 1,843 1,843 2008 1,497 1,497 2009 1,374 1,374 Thereafter 1,305 1,305 Total estimated cash outflows (1) $ 10,979 $ 1,910 $ 12,889 (1) Cash flows are presented net of an estimated $20 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2004, we had signed contractual sublease agreements totaling $13 million. For additional information about our operational restructuring, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Other Operating Expense (Income). Income from Operations Our income from operations was $440 million, $271 million, and $64 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002. These increases primarily result from net sales and gross profit growth and declines in operating expenses as a percent of net sales as we leverage the fixed cost portion of our cost structure and seek to improve our variable costs through process efficiencies. Additionally, in 2004 and 2003 operating income improved from year over year reductions of $47 million and $8 million in stock based compensation expense associated with variable accounting, offset by increases in stock based compensation of $18 million and $27 million associated with restricted stock units. Net Interest Expense The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments, including $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and 690 million Euros ($935 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2004) of 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2004. Interest expense was $107 million, $130 million, and $143 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $150 million and $464 million in 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004, our total long term indebtedness was $1.86 billion compared to $1.95 billion a year ago. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt and Other. We generally invest our excess cash in A rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them. 41 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gains on sales of marketable securities, net $ 586 $ 9,598 $ 5,700 Foreign currency transaction losses, net (5,214 ) (3,043 ) (1,086 ) Other miscellaneous gains (losses), net (73 ) (41 ) 309 Total other income (expense), net $ (4,701 ) $ 6,514 $ 4,923 Foreign currency transaction losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS. Since these payments are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable (which is paid annually in February) is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Foreign currency losses on remeasurement of 6.875%PEACS (1) $ (65,375 ) $ (140,130 ) $ (103,136 ) Gains on sales of Euro denominated investments, net 9,469 5,827 2,227 Gains on sales of equity investments, net 15,406 796 13,044 Loss on redemption of long term debt (5,672 ) (23,829 ) Loss on termination of Euro Currency Swap (2) (5,880 ) Foreign currency effect on intercompany balances (3) 40,883 35,574 Other than temporary impairments and other (4) 4,465 (2,455 ) (12,577 ) Total remeasurements and other $ (824 ) $ (130,097 ) $ (100,442 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Remeasurements and other on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the remaining basis at date of termination of our Euro Currency Swap that previously was designated as a cash flow hedge of a portion of our 6.875% PEACS principal and interest. (3) Represents the gains associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. (4) Included in 2004 is a gain of $6 million relating to the settlement of a contractual dispute, and included in 2003 and 2002 is $0.4 million and $4 million of losses from equity method investees. No equity method losses or income were recorded in 2004. Income Taxes We record a tax provision or benefit for current and deferred U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes for all periods presented, classified as Provision (benefit) for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, 42 Table of Contents including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and it is very difficult to predict when, if ever, our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable. We had a net current tax benefit in 2004 of $233 million, representing $0.57 and $0.55 of basic and diluted earnings per share, resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004. In connection with this assessment we also recorded a net credit to Stockholders Deficit of $106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax assets are $363 million, comprised of approximately $270 million relating to our NOLs, with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting. Classification of deferred tax assets between current and long term categories is based on the expected timing of realization, and the valuation allowance is allocated ratably. At December 31, 2004, our gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs were approximately $800 million (relating to approximately $2.6 billion of NOLs), offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $530 million due to uncertainty about their future realization. If in the future, we determine that the remaining $530 million of NOL deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realizable, substantially all would be credited to Stockholders Deficit rather than the income statement since they primarily relate to tax deductible stock based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. The majority of our NOLs expire after 2016. We also have approximately $70 million of deferred tax assets relating to approximately $225 million capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2005 and thereafter. Due to uncertainty regarding future realization, we have provided a full valuation allowance for this portion of our deferred tax asset. Additionally, we expect net income for 2005 to decline because we expect a tax provision in 2005 rather than the large tax benefit we received in 2004. We expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately $25 million, compared with $4 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003. Net Income Net income was $588 million and $35 million in 2004 and 2003, and net loss was $149 million in 2002. We believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed, on its own, as a material positive event, and the year over year increases in net income of $553 million and $184 million in 2004 and 2003 are not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2004 we had a net benefit from income taxes of $233 million, representing $0.57 and $0.55 of basic and diluted earnings per share, resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. 43 Table of Contents Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Exchange rate effect on (1): Net sales $ 275,653 $ 232,370 $ 46,950 Gross profit 52,183 46,392 9,930 Operating expenses 32,011 32,054 6,039 Operating income 20,172 14,338 3,891 Net interest expense and other 8,801 11,135 2,393 Remeasurements and other (2) 15,023 98,729 100,879 Net income (loss) (3,652 ) (95,526 ) (99,381 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.01 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (0.26 ) (1) Represents the effect on reported results due to year over year changes in exchange rates. Absent year over year changes in exchange rates, reported amounts would have been lower (higher) by these amounts. (2) Includes foreign currency gains (losses) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances, and realized currency related gains associated with sales of Euro denominated investments held by a U.S. functional currency subsidiary. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Remeasurements and Other. Non GAAP Financial Measure: Free Cash Flow Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Cash provided by (used in) operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions such as our 2004 acquisition of Joyo.com (see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies). Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 44 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Cash provided by operating activities for 2004, 2003, and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 566,560 $ 392,022 $ 174,291 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (89,133 ) (45,963 ) (39,163 ) Free cash flow $ 477,427 $ 346,059 $ 135,128 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (317,631 ) $ 236,651 $ (121,684 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (97,292 ) $ (331,986 ) $ 106,894 Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 2, 2005 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2005 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $1.80 billion and $1.95 billion, or grow between 18% and 27%, compared with first quarter 2004. Operating income is expected to be between $80 million and $110 million, or decline between (28%) and 0%, compared with first quarter 2004, assuming, among other things, that the Company adopts SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2005, stock based compensation is $25 million, and there are no further revisions to restructuring related estimates. Full Year 2005 Expectations Net sales are expected to be between $8.05 billion and $8.65 billion, or grow between 16% and 25%. Operating income is expected to be between $385 million and $510 million, or between (13%) and 16% growth, compared with 2004, assuming, among other things, that the Company adopts SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2005, stock based compensation is $115 million, and there are no further revisions to restructuring related estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part 1, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Liquidity and Capital Resources, above. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in A rated or higher, short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual 45 Table of Contents funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2004 (in thousands, except percentages): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2004 Commercial paper and short term obligations $ 122,073 $ $ $ $ $ $ 122,073 $ 124,215 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % 2.10 % Certificates of deposit 496,412 496,412 496,412 Weighted average interest rate 2.52 % 2.52 % Corporate notes and bonds 240,213 3,760 2,900 8,000 13,390 268,263 275,058 Weighted average interest rate 2.25 % 3.45 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 2.43 % Asset backed and agency securities 136,202 134,754 21,127 21,570 8,500 322,153 323,245 Weighted average interest rate 2.32 % 4.01 % 3.58 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.17 % Treasury notes and bonds 11,845 67,205 32,620 21,100 10,500 143,270 140,728 Weighted average interest rate 2.43 % 2.87 % 3.18 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 2.93 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,006,745 $ 205,719 $ 56,647 $ 50,670 $ 32,390 $ $ 1,352,171 $ 1,359,658 46 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2003 (in thousands, except percentages): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2003 Commercial paper and short term obligations $ 675,061 $ $ $ $ $ $ 675,061 $ 675,061 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % 2.00 % Certificates of deposit 27,395 27,395 27,395 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % 2.00 % Corporate notes and bonds 11,280 2,000 8,520 2,330 24,130 24,997 Weighted average interest rate 1.34 % 1.51 % 1.96 % 1.96 % 1.68 % Asset backed and agency securities 20,700 18,875 30,370 14,440 84,385 85,692 Weighted average interest rate 1.22 % 1.88 % 2.03 % 2.32 % 1.83 % Treasury notes and bonds 4,000 6,751 95,770 37,600 144,121 145,778 Weighted average interest rate 1.12 % 1.59 % 1.50 % 2.12 % 1.96 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 738,436 $ 27,626 $ 134,660 $ 54,370 $ $ $ 955,092 $ 958,923 At December 31, 2004, we had long term debt of $1.86 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was 691 million Euros ($936 million) and 690 million Euros ($870 million) at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $907 million (outstanding principal of $900 million) and $1.06 billion (outstanding principal of $1.05 billion) at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2004, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 44% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and include Euros, British Pounds, Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Chinese Yuan. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2004, International segment revenues improved $271 million and our operating results improved $20 million in comparison with the prior year. 47 Table of Contents We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2004 of $970 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $49 million, $97 million, and $194 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2004 of 690 million Euros ($935 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2004). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $255 million as of December 31, 2004. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $47 million, $94 million, and $187 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2004, we would incur $3 million, $6 million, and $13 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. See also Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 Subsequent Events (Unaudited). Investment Risk As of December 31, 2004, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly traded and private companies) was $27 million, including $12 million classified as Marketable securities, and $15 million classified as Other assets. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2004 of $64 million (recorded basis of $20 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $19 million, and $32 million. 48 Table of Contents
