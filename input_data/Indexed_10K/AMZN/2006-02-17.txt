Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, 24 Table of Contents fulfillment center optimization, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, risks of inventory management, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A. of Part I, Risk Factors, which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors, publishers, and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. We offer services such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co branded credit cards, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than margin percentages. Because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards, the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is less than our income tax provision. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods, net of estimated cancellations. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 438 million at December 31, 2005, compared with 434 million at December 31, 2004 and 433 million at December 31, 2003. These totals include all stock awards outstanding, without regard for estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards, and in the money and out of the money stock options. We seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs. Our customer experience variable costs include product costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.  1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 25 Table of Contents Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a negative operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 14, 16, and 18 for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third party sales, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 54, 53, and 50 for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third party sales, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency, enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms, search, web services, and digital initiatives. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need  2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 26 Table of Contents to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Under our Syndicated Stores arrangements, we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory, set prices, and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service, and the other business earns a sales commission. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for online DVD rentals, Amazon Prime, and other membership programs, are deferred and classified in Unearned revenue on our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from third party sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the third party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. 27 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third party maintains ownership of the related products. Internal Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal use software are expensed as incurred. During 2005, 2004 and 2003 we capitalized $90 million (including $11 million of stock based compensation), $44 million, and $30 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development, which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $50 million, $30 million and $24 million. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered long term investments, in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders equity (deficit) as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation, any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets. Resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates, we recorded a loss of $47 million in 2005, and gains of $41 million and $36 million in 2004 and 2003. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. At December 31, 2005, our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance, were $291 million, which includes $123 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) that are primarily attributed to stock based compensation. The majority of our NOLs begin to expire in 2016. Additionally, we have elected to present our NOL deferred tax assets attributed to stock based compensation net of the related allowance as of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Total gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs at December 31, 2005 were $616 million (relating to approximately $1.9 billion of NOLs). 28 Table of Contents SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on a pro rata basis. We recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of $90 million, representing $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share, as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. The range of possible judgments relating to valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide. For example, had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that these deferred tax assets are realizable; the Provision (benefit) for income taxes would have been an expense of $185 million for 2005 rather than an expense of $95 million for the same period. At December 31, 2005 we continue to have a valuation allowance of $213 million, which relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the occurrence of future capital gains. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2005, we early adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow was $529 million for 2005, which includes the effect of a $40 million patent litigation settlement, compared to $477 million and $347 million for 2004 and 2003. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of expense payments, discounts offered by vendors, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $905 million and $970 million at the end of 2005 and 2004, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock based compensation was presented in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. SFAS 123(R) supersedes prior guidance and requires tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation. Tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $7 million, $8 million, and $4 million for December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow. We expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of $100 million, although the actual amount 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 29 Table of Contents is subject to considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results; however, the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification. Cash provided by operating activities was $733 million, $566 million, and $393 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from third party sellers, and from non retail activities such as through our co branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98 1 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, third party sellers and non retail activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels as well as increases or decreases in vendor related receivables for co operative marketing, volume rebates, and other incentives. During 2005, cash paid to inventory suppliers, totaled $5.5 billion, compared to $4.6 billion and $3.4 billion in 2004 and 2003. Cash paid to inventory suppliers is also affected by our efforts to add product categories, increase selection of products we offer for sale, improve availability in both existing and new product categories, and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Other Operating Expense (Income). Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, net cash flows from acquisitions, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development costs. Net cash used in investing activities was $778 million and $317 million in 2005 and 2004, while cash provided by investing activities was $236 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $204 million, $89 million and $46 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites, as well as investments in fulfillment related assets and technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures included $79 million, $44 million and $30 million for internal use software and website development during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. We also purchased certain companies in 2005 and 2004 resulting in cash payments, net of acquired cash, of $24 million and $71 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $193 million, $97 million, and $332 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations, which were $270 million in 2005, $157 million in 2004, and $495 million in 2003. During 2005, we repaid 200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $265 million. During 2004, we repaid $154 million to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt and Other. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, which were $66 million, $60 million, and $163 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock based awards. In 2005 we recorded a net tax provision of $95 million, and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of $233 million. A majority of this provision and benefit is non cash as we have deferred tax assets resulting from our history of net operating losses. In February 2006, we announced plans to redeem 250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 7, 2006, for a cash payment of approximately $305 million (at the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on January 31, 2006), which includes $1 million of interest. Under the indenture governing the 6.875% PEACS, no premium is required. 30 Table of Contents Additionally, in February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a new debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro denominated interest payable are classified as Other income, net on our consolidated statements of operations. Our inventory turnover was 14 and 16 for 2005 and 2004. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third party sales, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers, among other factors. The decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on maintaining wide merchandise selection of in stock inventory, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal and other (1) $ 14 $ 1 $ 2 $ 902 $ 587 $ 17 $ 1,523 Debt interest (1) 83 83 83 61 40 350 Capital leases 2 1 1 1 1 1 7 Operating leases (2)(3) 129 115 78 65 51 157 595 Purchase obligations (4) 289 12 8 8 8 8 333 Total commitments $ 517 $ 212 $ 172 $ 1,037 $ 687 $ 183 $ 2,808 (1) At December 31, 2005, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.1843. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $97 million as of December 31, 2005. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Additionally, on March 7, 2006, we will redeem 250 million of our outstanding 6.875% PEACS, which is not reflected in the table above. (2) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2005, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate totaling $595 million. If we had applied to our equipment operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $90 million of additional obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2005. (3) Includes $9 million related to restructuring related leases and other commitments, consisting of $4 million due within 12 months and included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $5 million due after 12 months and included in Long term debt and other on our balance sheets. These amounts are net of anticipated sublease income of $4 million. (4) Consists of legally binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non inventory commitments. 31 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge a portion of our cash equivalents or marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements. The amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases; with fluctuations in our market capitalization, which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock; and based on our credit rating. Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: StandbyLetters ofCredit (1) Line ofCredit (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 50 $ 2 $ 22 $ 74 Net change in collateral pledged 9 12 (4 ) 17 Balance at December 31, 2005 (4) $ 59 $ 14 $ 18 $ 91 (1) Pursuant to available standby letter of credit facilities totaling $139 million. (2) Pursuant to an available line of credit totaling $13 million, whereby collateral is required to be pledged at 110% of the outstanding balance. (3) The required amount of collateral to be pledged on certain of our real estate leases fluctuates based on our market capitalization. At December 31, 2005, our market capitalization was $19.6 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion. (4) Includes $19 million of cash equivalents pledged as collateral. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. 32 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 4,711 $ 3,847 $ 3,259 International 3,779 3,074 2,005 Consolidated $ 8,490 $ 6,921 $ 5,264 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 22 % 18 % 18 % International 23 53 71 Consolidated 23 31 34 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 22 % 18 % 18 % International 25 40 52 Consolidated 24 26 28 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 56 % 62 % International 45 44 38 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 23% in 2005, due to an acceleration of revenue growth in our North America segment, offset by slower revenue growth in our International segment, representing a decrease from 31% revenue growth in 2004 and 34% revenue growth in 2003. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, revenue growth was 24%, 26%, and 28% for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively affected 2005 net sales by $73 million, and positively affected net sales by $276 million and $232 million for 2004 and 2003. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth by changes in exchange rates, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America revenue growth rates increased to 22% in 2005, compared to 18% growth rates in 2004 and 2003. The increased growth rate primarily reflects an increase in unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and by increased selection such as through additions to our product categories, as well as increases in our service related revenues, particularly from Amazon Enterprise Solutions and from our co branded credit card agreement. Changes in currency exchange rates positively affected 2005, 2004, and 2003 net sales for our North America segment by $5 million, $5 million, and $6 million. International revenue growth rates declined to 23% in 2005, compared to 53% and 71% growth rates in 2004 and 2003. This decrease in revenue growth is primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates, which negatively affected revenue growth by $78 million for 2005 and positively affected revenue growth by $271 million and $226 million for 2004 and 2003. Additionally, revenue growth was affected by declining revenue growth rates in certain product categories, primarily media. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, revenue growth was 25%, 40%, and 52% for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We endeavor to increase sales over time by continuing to offer low prices, including from free shipping, convenience, including new and innovative features such as personalization, 1 Click, and Search Inside the Book, and broad product availability and selection, including from new product categories and from third party sales. 33 Table of Contents We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our Electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See Supplemental Information below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,267 $ 1,024 $ 867 International 772 578 390 Consolidated $ 2,039 $ 1,602 $ 1,257 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 24 % 18 % 17 % International 33 48 55 Consolidated 27 27 27 Gross Margin: North America 26.9 % 26.6 % 26.6 % International 20.4 18.8 19.5 Consolidated 24.0 23.1 23.9 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2005, compared to 2004 and 2003, corresponds with increases in sales, including increases in sales by third party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co branded credit card agreements, and increases in amounts earned from Amazon Enterprise Solutions, offset by our free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by third party sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and membership offers. Such free shipping and membership offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. Amazon Prime, introduced in 2005, is a shipping membership program in which members receive free two day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. We have offered free membership trials for Amazon Prime, and we expect to continue to offer these trials in the future. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by third party sellers on our websites continue to increase, representing 28%, 26%, and 22% of unit sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. If product sales by third party sellers continue to increase, the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will offset decreases in our gross margins due to lowering prices for customers over time by offering price reductions, free shipping offers, and promotions. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in sales by third party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co branded credit card agreement, and increases in amounts earned from service agreements, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party. 34 Table of Contents North America segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003. Changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers, including from our year round free shipping offers, were offset partially by increased sales volume by third party sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers. International segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting from several factors including increasing sales by third party sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers, offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our year round free shipping offers. International segment gross margins in 2004 declined 70 basis points compared to 2003 resulting from efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers, and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories, offset partially by increases in sales volume by third party sellers. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 511 $ 420 $ 372 Outbound shipping costs (750 ) (617 ) (508 ) Net shipping cost $ (239 ) $ (197 ) $ (136 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 22 % 13 % 2 % Outbound shipping costs 22 21 26 Net shipping cost 22 44 245 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 6.0 % 6.1 % 7.1 % Outbound shipping costs (8.8 ) (8.9 ) (9.7 ) Net shipping cost (2.8 )% (2.8 )% (2.6 )% (1) Outbound shipping charges to customers do not include amounts earned on shipping activities by third party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership program. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. In addition, we anticipate that the costs of lowering prices over time will be partially mitigated to the extent product sales by third party sellers continue to increase. 35 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 3,046 $ 2,589 $ 2,270 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,443 1,128 879 Other (1) 222 130 110 Total North America $ 4,711 $ 3,847 $ 3,259 International Media $ 2,885 $ 2,513 $ 1,779 Electronics and other general merchandise 886 559 225 Other (1) 8 2 1 Total International $ 3,779 $ 3,074 $ 2,005 Consolidated Media $ 5,931 $ 5,102 $ 4,049 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,329 1,687 1,104 Other (1) 230 132 111 Total consolidated $ 8,490 $ 6,921 $ 5,264 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 18 % 14 % 14 % Electronics and other general merchandise 28 28 29 Other 71 18 29 Total North America 22 18 18 International Media 15 % 41 % 61 % Electronics and other general merchandise 59 149 241 Other 234 98 (38 ) Total International 23 53 71 Consolidated Media 16 % 26 % 31 % Electronics and other general merchandise 38 53 48 Other 74 19 28 Total consolidated 23 32 34 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 70 % 74 % 77 % Electronics and other general merchandise 27 24 21 Other 3 2 2 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as our co branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 36 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation was as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 $ 601 $ (10 ) $ 591 $ 495 $ (18 ) $ 477 Marketing 198 (6 ) 192 162 (4 ) 158 128 (5 ) 123 Technology and content 451 (45 ) 406 283 (32 ) 251 257 (50 ) 207 General and administrative 166 (20 ) 146 124 (12 ) 112 104 (15 ) 89 Other operating expense 47 47 (8 ) (8 ) 3 3 Total operating expenses $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 $ 1,162 $ (58 ) $ 1,104 $ 987 $ (88 ) $ 899 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 24 % 23 % 21 % 24 % 22 % 22 % Marketing 22 22 27 29 (1 ) (2 ) Technology and content 59 62 10 21 2 (4 ) General and administrative 34 30 20 27 8 12 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.8 % 8.6 % 8.7 % 8.5 % 9.4 % 9.1 % Marketing 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.3 Technology and content 5.3 4.8 4.1 3.6 4.9 3.9 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 1.8 1.6 2.0 1.7 See Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2005 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment includes stock based compensation of $16 million, $10 million, and $18 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to reduce customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with third party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs and our A to Z Guarantee costs associated with these transactions are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our increasing third party sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2005 and 2004 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space. We plan to continue expanding our world wide fulfillment capacity in order to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties where we provide the fulfillment. We expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment and fulfillment related cost of sales to increase over time. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, portal advertising, e mail campaigns, 37 Table of Contents and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. Marketing includes stock based compensation of $6 million, $4 million, and $5 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003. These increases correspond with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. We expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time. Technology and Content We significantly increased our spending in technology and content in 2005, which corresponds with our focus on several technology initiatives. We have added a significant number of computer scientists and software engineers to our staff so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us, improve our process efficiency, and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms, search, web services, and digital initiatives. We believe these initiatives that we are funding are important to our longer term success. See Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview for a discussion of how management views the competitive landscape and importance of innovation. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff, and expect absolute amounts spent in technology and content to increase over time. Technology and content includes stock based compensation of $45 million, $32 million, and $50 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. For the years ended 2005, 2004, and 2003, we capitalized $90 million (including $11 million of stock based compensation), $44 million, and $30 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development, which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $50 million, $30 million, and $24 million. Fixed assets associated with capitalized internal use software, content, and website development, net of accumulated depreciation, were $87 million and $47 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Capitalized internal use software is amortized over a useful life of two years. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, professional fees, and legal costs, offset by a $12 million credit in 2005 for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us. General and administrative includes stock based compensation of $20 million, $12 million, and $15 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect absolute amounts spent in general and administrative to increase over time. Stock Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2005, we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic value method, which followed the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and for stock options to the extent option 38 Table of Contents exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant. Also, to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer, other modifications, or performance criteria, such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment. To the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses. As of January 1, 2005, we early adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model, which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method under SFAS 123(R). The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a benefit of $10 million, $6 million net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, representing the cumulative effect of slightly increasing the rate of forfeitures expected over the life of issued stock awards based on our historical experience. Additionally, because we implemented SFAS 123(R), we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock based compensation was presented in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows, in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 00 15, Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option. SFAS 123(R) supersedes EITF 00 15, amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows, and requires tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation. Tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $7 million, $8 million, and $4 million for December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow. We expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of $100 million, although the actual amount is subject to considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results; however, the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification. On March 29, 2005, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides the Staffs views on a variety of matters relating to stock based payments. SAB 107 requires stock based compensation be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation. We have reclassified stock based compensation from prior periods to correspond to current period presentation within the same operating expense line items as cash compensation paid to employees. Stock based compensation was $87 million, $58 million and $88 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003. We applied the fair value accounting provisions of SFAS 123(R) for 2005 compared with the application of APB No. 25, including variable accounting treatment on certain awards, for 2004 and 2003. Because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004 and 2003, stock based compensation for 2005 is not comparable to prior periods. As of December 31, 2005, there was $169 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures of $106 million, related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements. 39 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Other operating income was $8 million for 2004 and other operating expense was $3 million for 2003, which includes restructuring related credits, net, of $9 million in 2004 and amortization of other intangibles of $1 million and $3 million in 2004 and 2003. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, was necessary for our future needs. We reduced our restructuring related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million for 2004. Lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. These efforts were primarily focused on eliminating French office positions in managerial, professional, clerical, and technical roles. The number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in Other operating expense (income) on the consolidated statements of operations. Income from Operations Our income from operations was $432 million, $440 million, and $270 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content, an increase in stock based compensation that is now recorded under SFAS 123(R) fair value accounting, and a payment of $40 million to settle a patent lawsuit. These increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit. The increase in operating income in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributed to increases in net sales and gross profit growth and leveraging operating expenses relative to net sales. Income from operations was negatively affected by year over year changes in exchange rates in 2005, and positively affected in 2004 and 2003. Net Interest Expense The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments, including a $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and a 490 million ($580 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2005) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2005. Interest expense was $92 million, $107 million, and $130 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $265 million and $150 million in 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, our total long term indebtedness was $1.52 billion compared to $1.86 billion at December 31, 2004. In February 2006, we announced plans to redeem 250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 7, 2006, for a cash payment of approximately $305 million (at the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on January 31, 2006), which includes $1 million of interest. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt and Other. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $2 million, $(5) million, and $7 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and consisted primarily of gains (losses) on sales of marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains (losses), and other miscellaneous losses, net. 40 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS. Since these payments are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable (which is paid annually in February) is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Foreign currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ 90 $ (65 ) $ (140 ) Gain (loss) on sales of Euro denominated investments, net (2 ) 9 6 Loss on redemption of long term debt (4) (6 ) (6 ) (24 ) Foreign currency effect on intercompany balances (2) (47 ) 41 36 Other (3) 7 20 (8 ) Total remeasurements and other $ 42 $ (1 ) $ (130 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Remeasurements and other on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. (3) Activity in 2005 and 2004 primarily includes gains associated with the sale of certain equity investments. Activity in 2003 primarily includes a loss from termination of our Euro currency swap. (4) We expect to record a charge of $6 million related to our announced plans to redeem 250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 6, 2006. Income Taxes We recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of $90 million, representing $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share, as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. Excluding this $90 million benefit, our effective tax rate would have been significantly higher than the 35% statutory rate, resulting from steps we initiated to establish our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 from the U.S. to international locations which resulted in taxable income and an increase in our effective tax rate. We will initiate similar asset transfers in 2006 to finalize our European headquarters transition, and we expect this will result in an effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006. There is potential for significant volatility of our 2006 effective tax rate due to several factors, including from variability in accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million, compared with $12 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. We are not endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a financial reporting basis, instead we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis. We recorded a tax benefit in 2004 of $244 million, representing $0.60 and $0.57 of basic and diluted earnings per share, and a credit to Stockholders Equity (Deficit) of $106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. At December 31, 2005, our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance, are $291 million, which includes $123 million relating to NOLs that are primarily attributed to stock based 41 Table of Contents compensation, the majority of which begin to expire in 2016, and $18 million relating to capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2006 and thereafter. The remaining portion relates to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The $123 million NOLs primarily attributed to stock based compensation are presented net of fully reserved NOL deferred tax assets totaling $493 million. Total gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs at December 31, 2005 were $616 million (relating to approximately $1.9 billion of NOLs). Net Income Net income was $359 million, $588 million and $35 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. We believe that year over year changes in net income are not necessarily predictive of our future net income results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of $95 million and in 2004 we recorded a net income tax benefit of $233 million. Included in these amounts in 2005 and 2004 were tax benefits of $90 million and $244 million resulting from our determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances resulted in net gains in 2005 and net charges in 2004 and 2003 associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results.

Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 733 $ 566 $ 393 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (204 ) (89 ) (46 ) Free cash flow $ 529 $ 477 $ 347 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (778 ) $ (317 ) $ 236 Net cash used in financing activities $ (193 ) $ (97 ) $ (332 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock based compensation, which excludes the employer portion of payroll tax expense. We provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Stock based compensation programs are an important element of the companys compensation structure and all forms of stock based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 2, 2006 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2006 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $2.14 billion and $2.29 billion, or grow between 13% and 20%, compared with first quarter 2005. Operating income is expected to be between $70 million and $105 million, or decline between (35%) and (3%), compared with first quarter 2005. This guidance includes $30 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded, and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation or restructuring related estimates. Full Year 2006 Expectations Net sales are expected to be between $9.85 billion and $10.45 billion, or grow between 16% and 23%, compared with 2005. Operating income is expected to be between $370 million and $510 million, or between (14%) decline and 18% growth, compared with 2005. This guidance includes $135 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no changes to stock based compensation or restructuring related estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A. of Part 1, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 44 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2005 (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2005 Money market funds $ 587 $ $ $ $ $ $ 587 $ 587 Weighted average interest rate 3.41 % 3.41 % Certificates of deposit 15 5 3 4 27 29 Weighted average interest rate 3.67 % 2.90 % 3.06 % 3.03 % 3.37 % Corporate debt securities 200 53 33 69 33 388 402 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.00 % 3.99 % 4.60 % 4.60 % 4.14 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 211 35 79 43 73 441 439 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.98 % 4.76 % 4.94 % 4.58 % 4.39 % Asset backed securities 131 97 33 5 10 276 276 Weighted average interest rate 3.89 % 4.94 % 4.10 % 5.02 % 4.95 % 4.34 % Other securities 3 33 47 35 18 136 165 Weighted average interest rate 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.83 % 2.95 % 3.01 % 2.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,147 $ 223 $ 195 $ 156 $ 134 $ $ 1,855 $ 1,898 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2004 (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2004 Money market funds $ 102 $ $ $ $ $ $ 102 $ 103 Weighted average interest rate 2.18 % 2.18 % Certificates of deposit 496 496 497 Weighted average interest rate 2.52 % 2.52 % Corporate debt securities 240 4 3 8 13 268 275 Weighted average interest rate 2.25 % 3.45 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 2.51 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 142 141 46 43 19 391 388 Weighted average interest rate 2.33 % 3.32 % 3.29 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 2.91 % Asset backed securities 61 8 69 70 Weighted average interest rate 4.38 % 3.10 % 4.24 % Other securities 26 26 27 Weighted average interest rate 2.24 % 2.24 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,006 $ 206 $ 57 $ 51 $ 32 $ $ 1,352 $ 1,360 At December 31, 2005, we had long term debt of $1.52 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 45 Table of Contents Based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was 495 million or $586 million (outstanding principal of 490 million) and 691 million or $936 million (outstanding principal of 690 million) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $868 million and $907 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2005, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2005, International segment revenues declined $78 million and our operating results declined $7 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2005 of $905 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $45 million, $91 million, and $181 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2005 of 490 million ($580 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2005). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $97 million as of December 31, 2005. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $29 million, $58 million, and $116 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2006, we would incur $2 million, $4 million, and $8 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2005, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly traded and private companies) was $14 million, including $6 million classified as Marketable securities, and $8 million classified as Other assets. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2005 of $44 million (recorded basis of $7 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $7 million, $13 million, and $22 million. 46 Table of Contents
