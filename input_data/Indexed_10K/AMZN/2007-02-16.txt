Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors, which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our websites include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third parties. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. We also offer services such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co branded credit cards, web services, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives, which generally requires us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. Because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards, the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is currently less than our income tax provision. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they better align 1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below. 23 Table of Contents the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded on an accelerated basis over the underlying service periods, net of estimated cancellations. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 436 million and 438 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. These totals include all stock awards outstanding, without regard for estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in the money and out of the money stock options. In 2006, we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs. Our customer experience variable costs include product costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 13, 14, and 16 for 2006, 2005, and 2004. Inventory turnover has declined over the last several years, primarily due to changes in product mix and our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third party sales, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 53, 54, and 53 for 2006, 2005 and 2004. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third party sales, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and category expansion as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 24 Table of Contents currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made 25 Table of Contents pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime, online DVD rentals, and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from third party sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the third party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third party maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Internal Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal use software are expensed as incurred. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Stock Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 26 Table of Contents based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. Since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees, the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures. If employees leave early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stock based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on a pro rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax 27 Table of Contents position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007. We estimate the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 702 $ 733 $ 566 Investing activities (333 ) (778 ) (317 ) Financing activities (400 ) (193 ) (97 ) Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, was $486 million for 2006, compared to $529 million and $477 million for 2005 and 2004. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation now classified as financing cash flows. Free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a $40 million patent litigation settlement. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $623 million and $905 million at the end of 2006 and 2005, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock based compensation was presented in operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating and financing cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $102 million, $7 million, and $8 million for December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, with the amounts for 2006 and 2005 treated as financing cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities was $702 million, $733 million, and $566 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the $40 million patent litigation settlement in 2005. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from third party sellers, and from non retail activities such as through our co branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98 1 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, third party sellers and non retail activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash used in investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash flows from acquisitions, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website 28 Table of Contents development costs. Cash used in investing activities was $333 million, $778 million, and $317 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $216 million, $204 million and $89 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites, as well as investments in fulfillment related assets and technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures included $108 million, $79 million and $44 million for internal use software and website development during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We also made payments, net of acquired cash, of $32 million, $24 million, and $71 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004 to purchase certain comapnies. Cash used in financing activities was $400 million, $193 million, and $97 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased $252 million of our common stock under a $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2006. Repayments on long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $383 million, $270 million, and $157 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Repayments on long term debt include 250 million and 200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. Additionally, we repaid $154 million to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2004. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt. If all of our capital leases were classified as operating leases, the detriment to cash flows from operating activities would have been $21 million, $2 million, and $4 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $35 million, $59 million, and $60 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions were $102 million and $7 million in 2006 and 2005, in accordance with adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock based awards. In 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of $187 million and $95 million, and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of $233 million. A majority of this provision and benefit is non cash. We have net operating losses that are classified as deferred tax assets and are being utilized to reduce our taxable income to nominal levels. As such, cash taxes paid were $15 million, $12 million, and $4 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. Additionally, in August 2006 our Board of Directors authorized a 24 month program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock, of which $248 million remains authorized for repurchase at December 31, 2006. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro denominated interest payable are classified as Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 13, 14, and 16 for 2006, 2005, and 2004. We expect some variability 29 Table of Contents in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third party sales, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers, among other factors. The decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on category expansion and maintaining wide selection of in stock inventory, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal and other (1) $ 17 $ $ 930 $ 317 $ $ $ 1,264 Debt interest (1) 66 66 44 22 198 Capital leases, including interest 35 7 5 4 4 5 60 Operating leases 129 113 91 72 50 184 639 Other commitments 20 5 8 6 1 19 59 Purchase obligations (2) 420 11 12 9 10 5 467 Total commitments $ 687 $ 202 $ 1,090 $ 430 $ 65 $ 213 $ 2,687 (1) At December 31, 2006, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.3201. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $80 million as of December 31, 2006. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Consists of legally binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non inventory commitments. Pledged Securities We are required to support certain letters of credit, debt, and real estate leases by pledging or otherwise restricting cash and marketable securities. We classify marketable securities, where a use restriction exists for a period of twelve months or longer, as non current Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2006 consisted of $50 million in Marketable securities and $86 million in Other assets. The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases with fluctuations in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock) and based on our credit rating. Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters ofCredit (1) Debt (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 59 $ 14 $ 18 $ 91 Net change in collateral pledged 1 42 2 45 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 60 $ 56 $ 20 $ 136 (1) Pursuant to available standby and trade letter of credit facilities totaling $233 million. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies. (2) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (3) At December 31, 2006, our market capitalization was $16.3 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion and decrease by $5 million if our market capitalization exceeds $18 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash 30 Table of Contents needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 5,869 $ 4,711 $ 3,847 International 4,842 3,779 3,074 Consolidated $ 10,711 $ 8,490 $ 6,921 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 25 % 22 % 18 % International 28 23 53 Consolidated 26 23 31 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 24 % 22 % 18 % International 28 25 40 Consolidated 26 24 26 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 55 % 56 % International 45 45 44 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 26% in 2006, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $24 million for 2006. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rate changes, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. The North America revenue growth rate was 25% in 2006. This revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock product availability, and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories. 31 Table of Contents The International revenue growth rate was 28% in 2006. This revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock product availability, and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $18 million in 2006. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See Supplemental Information below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,525 $ 1,267 $ 1,024 International 931 772 578 Consolidated $ 2,456 $ 2,039 $ 1,602 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 20 % 24 % 18 % International 21 33 48 Consolidated 20 27 27 Gross Margin: North America 26.0 % 26.9 % 26.6 % International 19.2 20.4 18.8 Consolidated 22.9 24.0 23.1 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2006, compared to 2005 and 2004, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by third party sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We offer promotions, such as free membership trials for Amazon Prime, and we expect to continue to offer these promotions in the future. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by third party sellers on our websites represented 28%, 28%, and 26% of unit sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix. Revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from third party sellers, resulting in lower gross margins. Sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media, further reducing gross margins. Additionally, we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. 32 Table of Contents North America segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in revenue by third party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co branded credit card agreement, improvements in terms with suppliers, and increases in amounts earned from service agreements, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. International segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix. Sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media, resulting in lower gross margins. International segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increasing revenue from third party sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers, offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 567 $ 511 $ 420 Outbound shipping costs (884 ) (750 ) (617 ) Net shipping cost $ (317 ) $ (239 ) $ (197 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 11 % 22 % 13 % Outbound shipping costs 18 22 21 Net shipping cost 32 22 44 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 5.3 % 6.0 % 6.1 % Outbound shipping costs (8.3 ) (8.8 ) (8.9 ) Net shipping cost (3.0 )% (2.8 )% (2.8 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership program. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. Our net shipping cost results primarily from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 33 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 3,582 $ 3,046 $ 2,589 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,024 1,443 1,128 Other (1) 263 222 130 Total North America $ 5,869 $ 4,711 $ 3,847 International Media $ 3,485 $ 2,885 $ 2,513 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,337 886 559 Other (1) 20 8 2 Total International $ 4,842 $ 3,779 $ 3,074 Consolidated Media $ 7,067 $ 5,931 $ 5,102 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,361 2,329 1,687 Other (1) 283 230 132 Total consolidated $ 10,711 $ 8,490 $ 6,921 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 18 % 18 % 14 % Electronics and other general merchandise 40 28 28 Other 18 71 18 Total North America 25 22 18 International Media 21 % 15 % 41 % Electronics and other general merchandise 51 59 149 Other 151 234 98 Total International 28 23 53 Consolidated Media 19 % 16 % 26 % Electronics and other general merchandise 44 38 53 Other 23 74 19 Total consolidated 26 23 32 Year over year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 21 % 17 % 29 % Electronics and other general merchandise 49 62 126 Other 147 247 79 Total International 28 25 40 Consolidated Media 19 % 17 % 20 % Electronics and other general merchandise 43 39 48 Other 23 74 19 Total consolidated 26 24 26 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 66 % 70 % 74 % Electronics and other general merchandise 31 27 24 Other 3 3 2 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, our co branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 34 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 $ 601 $ (10 ) $ 591 Marketing 263 (4 ) 259 198 (6 ) 192 162 (4 ) 158 Technology and content 662 (54 ) 608 451 (45 ) 406 283 (32 ) 251 General and administrative 195 (19 ) 176 166 (20 ) 146 124 (12 ) 112 Other operating expense 10 10 47 47 (8 ) (8 ) Total operating expenses $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 $ 1,162 $ (58 ) $ 1,104 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 26 % 25 % 24 % 23 % 21 % 24 % Marketing 32 34 22 22 27 29 Technology and content 47 50 59 62 10 21 General and administrative 18 21 34 30 20 27 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.7 % 8.5 % 8.8 % 8.6 % 8.7 % 8.5 % Marketing 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 6.2 5.7 5.3 4.8 4.1 3.6 General and administrative 1.8 1.6 1.9 1.7 1.8 1.6 Operating expenses without stock based compensation are non GAAP financial measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2006 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with third party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our third party sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2006 and 2005 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and in stock levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e mail campaigns, and other initiatives. 35 Table of Contents Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content In 2005 and 2006, we added computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, and digital initiatives, as well as expansion of new and existing product categories. Additionally, we increased spending on technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. We believe these initiatives are important to our long term success. See Overview above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff. For the years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004, we capitalized $123 million, $90 million, and $44 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $86 million, $50 million, and $30 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional fees. In 2005, we recorded a $12 million credit for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us. Stock Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2005, we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic value method, which followed the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and for stock options to the extent option exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant. Also, to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer, other modifications, or performance criteria, such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment. To the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses. As of January 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our 36 Table of Contents common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model, which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method under SFAS No. 123(R). The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. Additionally, because we implemented SFAS No. 123(R), we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Stock based compensation was $101 million, $87 million and $58 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. We applied the fair value accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for 2006 and 2005 compared with the application of APB Opinion No. 25, including variable accounting treatment on certain awards, for 2004. Because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004, stock based compensation for 2006 and 2005 is not comparable to prior periods. As of December 31, 2006, there was $217 million of net unrecognized compensation cost, related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements. Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense was $10 million in 2006, primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles. Other operating expense was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Other operating income was $8 million for 2004, which includes net restructuring related credits of $9 million and amortization of other intangibles of $1 million. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring was necessary for our future needs. We reduced our restructuring related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million for 2004. Lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. This reduction resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in Other operating expense (income) on our consolidated statements of operations. Income from Operations Income from operations was $389 million, $432 million, and $440 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content, an increase in stock based compensation that is now recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) fair value accounting, and a payment of $40 million to settle a patent lawsuit. These increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit. Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments, including a $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and a 37 Table of Contents 240 million ($317 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2006. Interest expense was $78 million, $92 million, and $107 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $300 million, $265 million, and $150 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. At December 31, 2006, our total long term indebtedness was $1.25 billion compared to $1.48 billion at December 31, 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt. Our interest income was $59 million, $44 million, and $28 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $(4) million, $2 million, and $(5) million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS, as well as foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments. Since interest payments on our 6.875% PEACS are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Foreign currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ (37 ) $ 90 $ (65 ) Loss on redemption of long term debt (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) Foreign currency gain (loss) on intercompany balances (2) 50 (47 ) 41 Other 4 5 29 Total remeasurements and other $ 11 $ 42 $ (1 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Remeasurements and other on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Foreign Currency. Income Taxes We recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $187 million, $95 million, and $(233) million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% statutory rate resulting from establishing our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. 38 Table of Contents Included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of $90 million, resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable. This tax benefit represented $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share. We recorded a tax benefit of $244 million in 2004, representing $0.60 and $0.57 of basic and diluted earnings per share, and a credit to stockholders equity of $106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35% or less. However, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, 2004 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 $ 8,563 $ (73 ) $ 8,490 $ 6,645 $ 276 $ 6,921 Gross profit 2,455 1 2,456 2,052 (13 ) 2,039 1,550 52 1,602 Operating expenses 2,064 3 2,067 1,612 (5 ) 1,607 1,130 32 1,162 Income from operations 391 (2 ) 389 440 (8 ) 432 420 20 440 Net interest expense and other (3) 17 6 23 52 (6 ) 46 75 9 84 Remeasurements and other income (expense) (4) (2 ) 13 11 1 41 42 14 (15 ) (1 ) Net income 188 2 190 328 31 359 592 (4 ) 588 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.44 $ 0.01 $ 0.45 $ 0.77 $ 0.07 $ 0.84 $ 1.40 $ (0.01 ) $ 1.39 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments. (4) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed 39 Table of Contents with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006, 2005, and 2004 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 702 $ 733 $ 566 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (216 ) (204 ) (89 ) Free cash flow $ 486 $ 529 $ 477 Net cash used in investing activities $ (333 ) $ (778 ) $ (317 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (400 ) $ (193 ) $ (97 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the Fulfillment, Technology and content, Marketing, and General and administrative line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock based compensation programs are an important element of the Companys compensation structure and all forms of stock based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. 40 Table of Contents Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 1, 2007 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2007 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $2.85 billion and $3.00 billion, or to grow between 25% and 32% compared with first quarter 2006. Operating income is expected to be between $82 million and $122 million, or between (22%) decline and 16% growth, compared with first quarter 2006. This guidance includes $38 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. Full Year 2007 Expectations Net sales are expected to be between $13.00 billion and $13.70 billion, or to grow between 21% and 28% compared with 2006. Operating income is expected to be between $355 million and $505 million, or between (9%) decline and 30% growth, compared with 2006. This guidance includes $165 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 41 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2006 (in millions, except percentages): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2006 Money market funds $ 763 $ $ $ $ $ $ 763 $ 763 Weighted average interest rate 3.92 % 3.92 % Certificates of deposit 50 50 50 Weighted average interest rate 5.25 % 5.25 % Corporate debt securities 266 45 40 29 39 419 419 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.43 % 5.23 % 5.04 % 4.83 % 5.35 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 53 32 20 39 27 37 208 207 Weighted average interest rate 5.24 % 4.77 % 4.88 % 4.85 % 4.95 % 5.46 % 5.06 % Asset backed securities 238 32 40 29 9 348 347 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.28 % 5.19 % 5.91 % 5.43 % Other securities 21 30 23 17 18 109 108 Weighted average interest rate 3.74 % 3.93 % 3.92 % 3.86 % 3.87 % 3.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,391 $ 139 $ 123 $ 114 $ 93 $ 37 $ 1,897 $ 1,894 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2005 (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2005 Money market funds $ 587 $ $ $ $ $ $ 587 $ 587 Weighted average interest rate 3.41 % 3.41 % Certificates of deposit 15 5 3 4 27 29 Weighted average interest rate 3.67 % 2.90 % 3.06 % 3.03 % 3.37 % Corporate debt securities 200 53 33 69 33 388 402 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.00 % 3.99 % 4.60 % 4.60 % 4.14 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 211 35 79 43 73 441 439 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.98 % 4.76 % 4.94 % 4.58 % 4.39 % Asset backed securities 131 97 33 5 10 276 275 Weighted average interest rate 3.89 % 4.94 % 4.10 % 5.02 % 4.95 % 4.34 % Other securities 3 33 47 35 18 136 166 Weighted average interest rate 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.83 % 2.95 % 3.01 % 2.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,147 $ 223 $ 195 $ 156 $ 134 $ $ 1,855 $ 1,898 At December 31, 2006, we had long term debt of $1.25 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (outstanding principal of $900 million) was $883 million and $868 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $320 million at December 31, 2006 (outstanding principal of 240 million), and $586 million at December 31, 2005 (outstanding principal of 490 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2006, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2006, International segment revenues increased $18 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2006 of $623 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $30 million, $60 million, and $125 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2006 of $386 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $20 million, $40 million, and $80 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2006 of 240 million ($317 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2006). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $80 million as of December 31, 2006. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $15 million, $30 million, and $65 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2006, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $4 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2006, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly traded and private companies) was $27 million, including $7 million classified as Marketable securities, and $19 million classified as Other assets. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2006 of $59 million (recorded basis of $11 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $20 million, and $30 million. 43 Table of Contents
