Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors, which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by marketplace sellers. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In managing shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in the money 1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below. 22 Table of Contents and out of the money stock options. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 435 million and 436 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. These amounts exclude 14 million shares issuable upon conversion of our long term debt. In 2007, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 13, 13, and 14 for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 57, 53, and 54 for 2007, 2006 and 2005. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved customer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the customer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. Amazon Web Services provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 23 Table of Contents higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the 24 Table of Contents carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. For our products with multiple elements, where a standalone value for each element cannot be established, we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by other sellers, the seller maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Internal Use Software and Website Development Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal use software are expensed as incurred. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income. Stock Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 25 Table of Contents based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees, the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stock based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on a pro rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. 26 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB may delay a portion of this standard. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No. 141 (R) or SFAS No. 160. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,405 $ 702 $ 733 Investing activities 42 (333 ) (778 ) Financing activities 50 (400 ) (193 ) Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, was $1.18 billion for 2007, compared to $486 million and $529 million for 2006 and 2005. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. The decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation deductions now classified as financing cash flows. Free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a $40 million patent litigation settlement. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $3.1 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $1.2 billion, $623 million, and 27 Table of Contents $905 million at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion, $702 million, and $733 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non retail activities such as our co branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98 1 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions and intellectual property rights, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $42 million, $(333) million, and $(778) million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $224 million, $216 million and $204 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. Capital expenditures included $108 million, $108 million and $79 million for internal use software and website development during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We made payments for the acquisition of certain companies and intellectual property rights, resulting in cash payments, net of acquired cash, of $75 million, $32 million, and $24 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005 attributable to cash provided by investing activities. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $50 million, $(400) million, and $(193) million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased 6 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007, and 8 million shares of common stock for $252 million in 2006, under a $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2006. Repayments on long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $74 million, $383 million, and $270 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Repayments on long term debt include 250 million and 200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions were $257 million, $102 million and $7 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $91 million, $35 million, and $59 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock based awards. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of $184 million, $187 million, and $95 million. A majority of this provision is non cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid were $24 million, $15 million, and $12 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open 28 Table of Contents market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes) and 6.875% PEACS. The outstanding principal of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes as of this authorization was $899 million, and the outstanding principal amount of our 6.875% PEACS was 240 million. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24 month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro denominated interest payable are classified as Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 13, 13, and 14 for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal (1) $ 17 $ 932 $ 350 $ $ $ $ 1,299 Debt interest (1) 69 46 24 139 Capital leases, including interest 32 29 23 6 6 5 101 Operating leases 132 107 89 69 52 201 650 Other commitments (2)(3) 60 64 80 60 43 579 886 Purchase obligations (4) 485 485 Total commitments $ 795 $ 1,178 $ 566 $ 135 $ 101 $ 785 $ 3,560 (1) At December 31, 2007, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.459. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $114 million as of December 31, 2007. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent, operating expenses, and tenant improvements associated with approximately 800,000 square feet of corporate office space in Seattle, Washington. We also have the right to occupy up to an additional approximately 800,000 square feet subject to a termination fee, estimated to be up to approximately $40 million, if we do not elect to occupy this additional space. The amount of space available and our financial and other obligations under the lease agreements are affected by various factors, including government approvals and permits, interest rates, development costs and other expenses and our exercise of certain rights under the lease agreements. See 29 Table of Contents Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. (3) Includes commitments to acquire intellectual property and unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48, but excludes $105 million of such unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Income Taxes. (4) Consists of legally binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non inventory commitments. In January 2008 we closed or entered into agreements, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, to acquire or invest in certain companies. These acquisitions and investments result in aggregate cash payments of approximately $400 million, net of cash acquired. Pledged Securities We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. We classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as non current Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2007 consisted of $14 million in Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities, and $197 million in Other assets. The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock). Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters of Creditand Guarantees Debt (1) Real EstateLeases (2) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 60 $ 56 $ 20 $ 136 Net change in collateral pledged 78 4 (7 ) 75 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 138 $ 60 $ 13 $ 211 (1) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (2) At December 31, 2006, our market capitalization was $38.6 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 8,095 $ 5,869 $ 4,711 International 6,740 4,842 3,779 Consolidated $ 14,835 $ 10,711 $ 8,490 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 38 % 25 % 22 % International 39 28 23 Consolidated 39 26 23 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 38 % 24 % 22 % International 31 28 25 Consolidated 35 26 24 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 55 % 55 % International 45 45 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 39% in 2007, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $399 million for 2007. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. The North America revenue growth rate was 38% in 2007. This revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. The International revenue growth rate was 39% in 2007. This revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $390 million in 2007. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See Supplemental Information below. 31 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 2,031 $ 1,525 $ 1,267 International 1,322 931 772 Consolidated $ 3,353 $ 2,456 $ 2,039 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 33 % 20 % 24 % International 42 21 33 Consolidated 37 20 27 Gross Margin: North America 25.1 % 26.0 % 26.9 % International 19.6 19.2 20.4 Consolidated 22.6 22.9 24.0 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2007, compared to 2006 and 2005, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by marketplace sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 28% of unit sales in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller . Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics. North America segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix, as revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from marketplace sellers. In addition, sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media and we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. International segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by marketplace sellers, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics. International segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix as sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media. 32 Table of Contents Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 740 $ 567 $ 511 Outbound shipping costs (1,174 ) (884 ) (750 ) Net shipping cost $ (434 ) $ (317 ) $ (239 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 31 % 11 % 22 % Outbound shipping costs 33 18 22 Net shipping cost 37 32 22 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 5.0 % 5.3 % 6.0 % Outbound shipping costs (7.9 ) (8.3 ) (8.8 ) Net shipping cost (2.9 )% (3.0 )% (2.8 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 33 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 4,630 $ 3,582 $ 3,046 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,139 2,024 1,443 Other (1) 326 263 222 Total North America $ 8,095 $ 5,869 $ 4,711 International Media $ 4,612 $ 3,485 $ 2,885 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,071 1,337 886 Other (1) 57 20 8 Total International $ 6,740 $ 4,842 $ 3,779 Consolidated Media $ 9,242 $ 7,067 $ 5,931 Electronics and other general merchandise 5,210 3,361 2,329 Other (1) 383 283 230 Total consolidated $ 14,835 $ 10,711 $ 8,490 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 29 % 18 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 40 28 Other 24 18 71 Total North America 38 25 22 International Media 32 % 21 % 15 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 51 59 Other 186 151 234 Total International 39 28 23 Consolidated Media 31 % 19 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 44 38 Other 35 23 74 Total consolidated 39 26 23 Year over year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 25 % 21 % 17 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 49 62 Other 165 147 247 Total International 31 28 25 Consolidated Media 27 % 19 % 17 % Electronics and other general merchandise 51 43 39 Other 34 23 74 Total consolidated 35 26 24 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 62 % 66 % 70 % Electronics and other general merchandise 35 31 27 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, our co branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional services. 34 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 Marketing 344 (8 ) 336 263 (4 ) 259 198 (6 ) 192 Technology and content 818 (103 ) 715 662 (54 ) 608 451 (45 ) 406 General and administrative 235 (35 ) 200 195 (19 ) 176 166 (20 ) 146 Other operating expense 9 9 10 10 47 47 Total operating expenses $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 38 % 37 % 26 % 25 % 24 % 23 % Marketing 31 30 32 34 22 22 Technology and content 23 17 47 50 59 62 General and administrative 20 13 18 21 34 30 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.7 % 8.5 % 8.8 % 8.6 % Marketing 2.3 2.3 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 5.5 4.8 6.2 5.7 5.3 4.8 General and administrative 1.6 1.3 1.8 1.6 1.9 1.7 Operating expenses without stock based compensation are non GAAP financial measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2007 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain marketplace seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2007, 2006, and 2005 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e mail campaigns, and other initiatives. 35 Table of Contents Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, and digital initiatives, as well as expansion of new and existing product categories. We are also investing in technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See Overview above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. The growth rate of our technology and content spending decreased in 2007 compared to the prior year. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2007, 2006, and 2005, we capitalized $129 million, $123 million, and $90 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $116 million, $86 million, and $50 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional fees. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Stock based compensation was $185 million, $101 million and $87 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. The increase in stock based compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees. 36 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net, was $9 million and $10 million during 2007 and 2006, primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles. Other operating expense, net, was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Income from Operations Income from operations was $655 million, $389 million, and $432 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. The increase in 2007 from 2006 is primarily a result of the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content. Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments, including a $899 million principal balance of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and a 240 million ($350 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2007) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2007. Interest expense was $77 million, $78 million, and $92 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. Our total long term indebtedness was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Long Term Debt. Our interest income was $90 million, $59 million, and $44 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $(1) million, $(4) million, and $2 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS, as well as foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments. Since interest payments on our 6.875% PEACS are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Foreign currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS $ (33 ) $ (37 ) $ 90 Loss on redemption of long term debt (6 ) (6 ) Foreign currency gain (loss) on intercompany balances 32 50 (47 ) Other (6 ) 4 5 Total remeasurements and other $ (7 ) $ 11 $ 42 (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Remeasurements and other on our consolidated statements of operations. 37 Table of Contents (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Foreign Currency. Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $184 million, $187 million, and $95 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The effective tax rate in 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. Included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of $90 million, resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable. This tax benefit represented $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share. We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30%. However, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, and business acquisitions and investments. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 $ 8,563 $ (73 ) $ 8,490 Gross profit 3,274 79 3,353 2,455 1 2,456 2,052 (13 ) 2,039 Operating expenses 2,648 50 2,698 2,064 3 2,067 1,612 (5 ) 1,607 Income from operations 626 29 655 391 (2 ) 389 440 (8 ) 432 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 11 1 12 (17 ) (6 ) (23 ) (52 ) 6 (46 ) Remeasurements and other income (expense) (4) (6 ) (1 ) (7 ) (2 ) 13 11 1 41 42 Net income 456 20 476 188 2 190 328 31 359 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances.

(4) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities for 2007, 2006, and 2005 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,405 $ 702 $ 733 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (224 ) (216 ) (204 ) Free cash flow $ 1,181 $ 486 $ 529 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 42 $ (333 ) $ (778 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 50 $ (400 ) $ (193 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in 39 Table of Contents the form of stock based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the Fulfillment, Technology and content, Marketing, and General and administrative line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock based compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stock based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. Guidance The Company provided guidance on January 30, 2008 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2008 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion, or to grow between 31% and 38% compared with first quarter 2007. Operating income is expected to be between $155 million and $200 million, or to grow between 7% and 38% compared with first quarter 2007. This guidance includes $55 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional acquired intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. Full Year 2008 Expectations Net sales are expected to be between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, or to grow between 26% and 33% compared with 2007. Operating income is expected to be between $785 million and $985 million, or to grow between 20% and 50% compared with 2007. This guidance includes $240 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional acquired intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2007 (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2007 Money market funds $ 1,408 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,408 $ 1,408 Weighted average interest rate 4.42 % 4.42 % Certificates of deposit Weighted average interest rate Corporate debt securities 6 16 26 49 18 115 116 Weighted average interest rate 5.11 % 4.65 % 4.78 % 4.59 % 4.85 % 4.71 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 120 49 49 33 46 297 301 Weighted average interest rate 4.26 % 3.20 % 3.69 % 3.72 % 3.46 % 3.81 % Asset backed securities 10 31 30 28 1 1 101 101 Weighted average interest rate 5.17 % 4.80 % 4.74 % 4.99 % 4.62 % 4.65 % 4.87 % Foreign government and agency securities 274 30 18 26 9 357 357 Weighted average interest rate 4.28 % 3.49 % 3.71 % 3.89 % 3.83 % 4.15 % Other securities 4 4 4 Weighted average interest rate 4.55 % 4.55 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,818 $ 130 $ 123 $ 136 $ 74 $ 1 $ 2,282 $ 2,287 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2006 (in millions, except percentages): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2006 Money market funds $ 763 $ $ $ $ $ $ 763 $ 763 Weighted average interest rate 3.92 % 3.92 % Certificates of deposit 50 50 50 Weighted average interest rate 5.25 % 5.25 % Corporate debt securities 266 45 40 29 39 419 419 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.43 % 5.23 % 5.04 % 4.83 % 5.35 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 53 32 20 39 27 37 208 207 Weighted average interest rate 5.24 % 4.77 % 4.88 % 4.85 % 4.95 % 5.46 % 5.06 % Asset backed securities 238 32 40 29 9 348 347 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.28 % 5.19 % 5.91 % 5.43 % Foreign government and agency securities 21 28 21 17 18 105 104 Weighted average interest rate 3.74 % 3.83 % 3.83 % 3.86 % 3.87 % 3.82 % Other securities 2 2 4 4 Weighted average interest rate 5.08 % 5.12 % 5.10 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 1,391 $ 139 $ 123 $ 114 $ 93 $ 37 $ 1,897 $ 1,894 At December 31, 2007, we had long term debt of $1.3 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 41 Table of Contents Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of $899 million) and $883 million (outstanding principal of $900 million) at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $358 million at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of 240 million), and $320 million at December 31, 2006 (outstanding principal of 240 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2007, net sales from our International segment accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2007, International segment revenues increased $390 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2007 of $1.2 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $60 million, $120 million, and $240 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2007 of $250 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $15 million, $25 million, and $50 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2007 of 240 million ($350 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2007). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $114 million as of December 31, 2007. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $20 million, $35 million, and $70 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2007, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2007, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly traded and private companies) was $29 million, including $12 million classified as Marketable securities, and $17 million classified as Other assets. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2007 of $55 million (recorded basis of $12 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $15 million, and $25 million. 42 Table of Contents
