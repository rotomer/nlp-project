Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, co branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers, such as online advertising. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in the money and out of the money stock options. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 446 million 1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below. 20 Table of Contents and 435 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. These amounts exclude shares issuable upon conversion of our long term debt. In 2008 and 2007, we repurchased 2.2 million shares and 6.3 million shares of our common stock under repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 12, 13, and 13 for 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 62, 57, and 53 for 2008, 2007 and 2006. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. We are investing in Amazon Web Services, which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business. A continuing challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 21 Table of Contents economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime and 22 Table of Contents other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. For our products with multiple elements, where a standalone value for each element cannot be established, we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in Net sales. Commissions and per unit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through other seller sites are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectability is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by other sellers, the seller maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. We also have equity method investments in private companies where we can exercise significant influence over, but not control, the entity. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments are other than temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment. Factors considered include, if applicable, quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; other publicly available information; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; or other conditions that may affect the value of our investments. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on projected category expansion, pricing expectations, market segment penetration and general economic conditions. Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and 23 Table of Contents developing revenue models. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated and compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend. Internal Use Software and Website Development Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and amortize these costs over its estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal use software are expensed as incurred. Stock Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards attributable to differences in stock based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. 24 Table of Contents Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on a pro rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies) accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, SFAS No. 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. See Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies and Note 2 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities for further discussion. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. FSP 157 2 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. Those assets and liabilities measured at fair value under SFAS No. 157 in Q1 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with FSP 157 2, we will measure the remaining assets and liabilities beginning Q1 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157, as amended by FSP 157 2, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP No. 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to 25 Table of Contents determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP No. 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of FSP No. 142 3 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 07 05, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. EITF Issue No. 07 05 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entitys own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. EITF Issue No. 07 05 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue No. 07 05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,697 $ 1,405 $ 702 Investing activities (1,199 ) 42 (333 ) Financing activities (198 ) 50 (400 ) Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, was $1.36 billion for 2008, compared to $1.18 billion and $486 million for 2007 and 2006. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income, offset by increased capital expenditures. The increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from increased operating income. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $3.7 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion, and $623 million at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Income Taxes. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion, and $702 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non retail activities such as through our co branded credit card agreements, other seller services, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98 1 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions, equity method investments and intellectual property rights, 26 Table of Contents and purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(1.2) billion, $42 million, and $(333) million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, and acquisition activity. Capital expenditures were $333 million, $224 million, and $216 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. Capital expenditures included $128 million, $108 million, and $108 million for internal use software and website development during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we made payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $494 million, $75 million, and $32 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(198) million, $50 million, and $(400) million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007, and 8.2 million shares of common stock for $252 million in 2006, under the $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2006. Repayments on long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $355 million, $74 million, and $383 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Repayments on long term debt include $294 million on our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2008, and 250 million ($300 million) of our 6.875% PEACS in 2006. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Long Term Debt. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires the reporting of tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions in financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions were $159 million, $257 million, and $102 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $11 million, $91 million, and $35 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock based awards. In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded net tax provisions of $247 million, $184 million, and $187 million. A majority of this provision is non cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid were $53 million, $24 million, and $15 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. As our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized, cash paid for taxes will increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 and 6.875% PEACS. In 2008, we called for redemption all of the remaining principal amount of $899 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Holders elected to convert $605 million in principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, and we issued 7.8 million shares of our common stock as a result. We redeemed the remaining $294 million of the called principal amount for cash. At December 31, 2008, the debt balance of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was zero, and the debt balance of our 6.875% PEACS was $335 million. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24 month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the February 2008 Board authorization. 27 Table of Contents Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro denominated interest payable are classified as Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 12, 13, and 13 for 2008, 2007, and 2006. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal (1) $ 59 $ 335 $ 41 $ 33 $ $ $ 468 Debt interest (1) 30 28 5 1 64 Capital leases, including interest 86 77 44 7 4 1 219 Operating leases 146 127 105 93 84 261 816 Other commitments (2)(3) 96 143 88 84 76 1,005 1,492 Purchase obligations (4) 497 497 Total commitments $ 914 $ 710 $ 283 $ 218 $ 164 $ 1,267 $ 3,556 (1) At December 31, 2008, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.3974. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $99 million as of December 31, 2008. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemption of the 6.875% PEACS and full redemption of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent, operating expenses, and tenant improvements associated with approximately 1,360,000 square feet of corporate office space being developed in Seattle, Washington with initial terms of up to 16 years commencing on completion of development in 2010 and 2011, and also includes a $10 million termination fee related to our right to occupy up to an additional approximately 330,000 square feet. The amount of space available and our financial and other obligations under the lease agreements are affected by various factors, including government approvals and permits, interest rates, development costs and other expenses and our exercise of certain rights under the lease agreements. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. (3) Excludes $166 million of tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if at all. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Income Taxes. (4) Consists primarily of inventory commitments. 28 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. We classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as non current Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2008 consisted of $308 million included in Other assets. The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock). Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters of Creditand Guarantees Debt (1) Real EstateLeases (2) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 138 $ 60 $ 13 $ 211 Net change in collateral pledged 100 (3 ) 97 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 138 $ 160 $ 10 $ 308 (1) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (2) At December 31, 2008, our market capitalization was $22.0 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18.0 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13.0 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Our period over period revenue growth was 26% in 2006, 39% in 2007 and 36% for the first three quarters of 2008. For Q4 2008, our quarterly revenue growth rate declined to 18%, driven primarily by decreased consumer demand following disruptions in the global financial markets and changes in foreign exchange rates (excluding the $320 million unfavorable impact from year over year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the fourth quarter, net sales would have grown 24% compared with Q4 2007). See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 Quarterly Results (Unaudited). 29 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 10,228 $ 8,095 $ 5,869 International 8,938 6,740 4,842 Consolidated $ 19,166 $ 14,835 $ 10,711 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 26 % 38 % 25 % International 33 39 28 Consolidated 29 39 26 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 26 % 38 % 24 % International 31 31 28 Consolidated 28 35 26 Net Sales Mix: North America 53 % 55 % 55 % International 47 45 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 29%, 39%, and 26% in 2008, 2007, and 2006, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $127 million, $399 million, and $24 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. The North America revenue growth rate was 26%, 38%, and 25% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. The International revenue growth rate was 33%, 39%, and 28% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in revenue in each year reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $131 million, $390 million, and $18 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See Supplemental Information below. 30 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 2,495 $ 2,031 $ 1,525 International 1,775 1,322 931 Consolidated $ 4,270 $ 3,353 $ 2,456 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 23 % 33 % 20 % International 34 42 21 Consolidated 27 37 20 Gross Margin: North America 24.4 % 25.1 % 26.0 % International 19.9 19.6 19.2 Consolidated 22.3 22.6 22.9 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2008, compared to 2007 and 2006, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by other sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 29%, 28%, and 28% of unit sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing. North America segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. International segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. 31 Table of Contents International segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 835 $ 740 $ 567 Outbound shipping costs (1,465 ) (1,174 ) (884 ) Net shipping cost $ (630 ) $ (434 ) $ (317 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 13 % 31 % 11 % Outbound shipping costs 25 33 18 Net shipping cost 45 37 32 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 4.4 % 5.0 % 5.3 % Outbound shipping costs (7.6 ) (7.9 ) (8.3 ) Net shipping cost (3.2 )% (2.9 )% (3.0 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 32 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 5,350 $ 4,630 $ 3,582 Electronics and other general merchandise 4,430 3,139 2,024 Other (1) 448 326 263 Total North America $ 10,228 $ 8,095 $ 5,869 International Media $ 5,734 $ 4,612 $ 3,485 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,110 2,071 1,337 Other (1) 94 57 20 Total International $ 8,938 $ 6,740 $ 4,842 Consolidated Media $ 11,084 $ 9,242 $ 7,067 Electronics and other general merchandise 7,540 5,210 3,361 Other (1) 542 383 283 Total consolidated $ 19,166 $ 14,835 $ 10,711 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 16 % 29 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 41 55 40 Other 38 24 18 Total North America 26 38 25 International Media 24 % 32 % 21 % Electronics and other general merchandise 50 55 51 Other 65 186 151 Total International 33 39 28 Consolidated Media 20 % 31 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 55 44 Other 42 35 23 Total consolidated 29 39 26 Year over year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 22 % 25 % 21 % Electronics and other general merchandise 49 45 49 Other 67 165 147 Total International 31 31 28 Consolidated Media 19 % 27 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 44 51 43 Other 42 34 23 Total consolidated 28 35 26 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 58 % 62 % 66 % Electronics and other general merchandise 39 35 31 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as other seller sites, our co branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 33 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 1,658 $ (61 ) $ 1,597 $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 Marketing 482 (13 ) 469 344 (8 ) 336 263 (4 ) 259 Technology and content 1,033 (151 ) 882 818 (103 ) 715 662 (54 ) 608 General and administrative 279 (50 ) 229 235 (35 ) 200 195 (19 ) 176 Other operating expense (income), net (24 ) (24 ) 9 9 10 10 Total operating expenses $ 3,428 $ (275 ) $ 3,153 $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 28 % 27 % 38 % 37 % 26 % 25 % Marketing 40 39 31 30 32 34 Technology and content 26 23 23 17 47 50 General and administrative 19 15 20 13 18 21 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.6 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.7 % 8.5 % Marketing 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.5 2.4 Technology and content 5.4 4.6 5.5 4.8 6.2 5.7 General and administrative 1.5 1.2 1.6 1.3 1.8 1.6 Operating expenses without stock based compensation are non GAAP financial measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2008 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2008, 2007, and 2006 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion was designed to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide fulfillment services. We periodically evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. 34 Table of Contents Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e mail campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program and sponsored search programs. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See Overview above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2008, 2007, and 2006, we capitalized $187 million, $129 million, and $123 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $143 million, $116 million, and $86 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock Based Compensation SFAS No. 123(R) requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. Stock based compensation was $275 million, $185 million, and $101 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in stock based compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, was $(24) million, $9 million and $10 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006. The increase in other operating income in 2008 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily attributable to the $53 million non cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets. Other operating expense in 2007 and 2006 was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets. Income from Operations Income from operations was $842 million, $655 million, and $389 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in each year is primarily a result of increased revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. Additionally, 2008 includes the $53 million non cash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets included in Other operating expense (income), net. Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments, including our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, which were no longer outstanding at December 31, 2008, and our 6.875% PEACS, which had a principal balance of 240 million ($335 million based on the exchange rate) at December 31, 2008. Interest expense was $71 million, $77 million, and $78 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of $899 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2006. Our total debt was $468 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Long Term Debt. Our interest income was $83 million, $90 million, and $59 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Foreign currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ 15 $ (33 ) $ (37 ) Foreign currency gain on intercompany balances (2) 23 32 50 Other 9 (7 ) (6 ) Other income (expense), net $ 47 $ (8 ) $ 7 (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to Other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Foreign Currency. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $247 million, $184 million, and $187 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The effective tax rate in 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expected to benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 Gross profit 4,240 30 4,270 3,274 79 3,353 2,455 1 2,456 Operating expenses 3,408 20 3,428 2,648 50 2,698 2,064 3 2,067 Income from operations 832 10 842 626 29 655 391 (2 ) 389 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 17 42 59 5 5 (19 ) 7 (12 ) Net income 609 36 645 456 20 476 188 2 190 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 $ 1.07 $ 0.05 $ 1.12 $ 0.44 $ 0.01 $ 0.45 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments, remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 37 Table of Contents Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008, 2007, and 2006 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,697 $ 1,405 $ 702 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (333 ) (224 ) (216 ) Free cash flow $ 1,364 $ 1,181 $ 486 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,199 ) $ 42 $ (333 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (198 ) $ 50 $ (400 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the Fulfillment, Technology and content, Marketing, and General and administrative line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock based compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stock based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. Guidance The Company provided guidance on January 29, 2009 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2009 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $4.525 billion and $4.925 billion, or to grow between 9% and 19% compared with first quarter 2008. 38 Table of Contents Operating income is expected to be between $125 million and $210 million, or between 37% decline and 6% growth compared with first quarter 2008. This guidance includes approximately $75 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2008 (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2008 Money market funds $ 1,682 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,682 $ 1,682 Weighted average interest rate 0.78 % 0.78 % Corporate debt securities 17 44 103 19 11 194 194 Weighted average interest rate 5.35 % 5.06 % 4.93 % 5.23 % 5.42 % 5.06 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 463 47 58 11 7 586 594 Weighted average interest rate 0.36 % 2.09 % 2.29 % 3.61 % 3.80 % 0.79 % Asset backed securities 10 28 20 5 63 58 Weighted average interest rate 8.24 % 9.32 % 8.22 % 6.32 % 8.58 % Foreign government and agency securities 915 42 39 62 63 1,121 1,128 Weighted average interest rate 1.41 % 3.58 % 4.02 % 3.71 % 3.75 % 1.84 % Other securities 2 10 9 21 23 Weighted average interest rate 3.17 % 1.25 % 2.30 % 1.87 % $ 3,089 $ 171 $ 220 $ 106 $ 81 $ $ 3,667 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 3,679 39 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our current and long term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2007 (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2007 Money market funds $ 1,558 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,558 $ 1,558 Weighted average interest rate 4.38 % 4.38 % Corporate debt securities 7 17 29 53 21 127 128 Weighted average interest rate 5.09 % 4.64 % 4.77 % 4.58 % 4.86 % 4.71 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 122 57 56 40 50 325 331 Weighted average interest rate 4.26 % 3.27 % 3.66 % 3.73 % 3.49 % 3.80 % Asset backed securities 11 35 30 28 1 1 106 106 Weighted average interest rate 5.15 % 4.78 % 4.74 % 4.99 % 4.62 % 4.65 % 4.86 % Foreign government and agency securities 274 31 18 26 9 358 357 Weighted average interest rate 4.28 % 3.49 % 3.71 % 3.89 % 3.83 % 4.15 % Other securities 4 4 4 Weighted average interest rate 4.53 % 4.53 % $ 1,972 $ 144 $ 133 $ 147 $ 81 $ 1 $ 2,478 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 2,484 At December 31, 2008, we had debt of $468 million primarily associated with our 6.875% PEACS, which is due in 2010. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. There was no amount of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes outstanding at December 31, 2008. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of $899 million). The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $332 million at December 31, 2008, and $358 million at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of 240 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2008, net sales from our International segment accounted for 47% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2008, International segment revenues increased $131 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2008 of $1.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $85 million, 40 Table of Contents $170 million, and $335 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2008 of $150 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $5 million, $15 million, and $30 million, recorded to Other income (expense), net. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2008 of 240 million ($335 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $99 million as of December 31, 2008. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $17 million, $35 million, and $65 million, recorded to Other expense (income), net. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20%, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2008, our recorded basis in equity investments was $90 million. These investments primarily relate to equity method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other than temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 41 Table of Contents
