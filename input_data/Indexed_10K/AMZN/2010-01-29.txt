Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell the Kindle e reader. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, co branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers, such as online advertising. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 461 million and 446 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below. 19 Table of Contents We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and our Kindle e reader, and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 12, 12, and 13 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 68, 62, and 57 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. We are investing in Amazon Web Services, which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business, and in our Kindle e reader. A continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 20 Table of Contents In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2009 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $23 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment penetration and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitors the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment test. A 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2009 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. 21 Table of Contents Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2009 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, current economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an approximately $13 million impact on our 2009 consolidated operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 33.1% and 37.1%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable, the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity.

Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, was $2.92 billion for 2009, compared to $1.36 billion and $1.18 billion for 2008 and 2007. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital, increased operating income, and increased deferred revenue. The increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income, offset by increased capital expenditures. Tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows; accordingly, as such tax benefits decline, a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $6.4 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.1 billion, at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $2.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non retail activities such as marketing and promotional agreements, Amazon Web Services, other seller services, and our co branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital, including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns, as well as changes to non cash items such as excess stock based compensation and deferred taxes. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions, equity method investments and intellectual property rights, and purchases of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and internal use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(2.3) billion, $(1.2) billion, and $42 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, partially offset by decreases in cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $373 million, $333 million, and $224 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. In 2010 we plan to significantly increase 23 Table of Contents our capital expenditures for additional investments in corporate office space and in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our fulfillment operations and Amazon Web Services. Capital expenditures included $146 million, $128 million, and $108 million for internal use software and website development during 2009, 2008, and 2007. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we made payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $40 million, $494 million, and $75 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(280) million, $(198) million, and $50 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long term debt, payments on capital lease obligations, and repurchases of common stock. Repayments on long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $472 million, $355 million, and $74 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Repayments on long term debt include $319 million on our 6.875% Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities (PEACS) in 2009, and $294 million on our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2008. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Long Term Debt. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007 under the $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2006. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions. Tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows (outflows) from tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions were $105 million, $159 million, and $257 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007. In 2009, 2008, and 2007 we recorded net tax provisions of $253 million, $247 million, and $184 million. A majority of this provision is non cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $48 million, $53 million, and $24 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. As our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized, cash paid for taxes will increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24 month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24 month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the February 2008 Board authorization. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2009. In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock which replaces the Boards prior authorization. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non inventory commitments, were $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 12, 12, and 13 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. 24 Table of Contents We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 12,828 $ 10,228 $ 8,095 International 11,681 8,938 6,740 Consolidated $ 24,509 $ 19,166 $ 14,835 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 25 % 26 % 38 % International 31 33 39 Consolidated 28 29 39 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 26 % 26 % 38 % International 33 31 31 Consolidated 29 28 35 Net Sales Mix: North America 52 % 53 % 55 % International 48 47 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 28%, 29%, and 39% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected net sales by $(182) million, $127 million, and $399 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. The North America revenue growth rate was 25%, 26%, and 38% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and by increased in stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. 25 Table of Contents The International revenue growth rate was 31%, 33%, and 39% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, and Amazon Prime, and by increased in stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected International net sales by $(174) million, $131 million, and $390 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See Supplemental Information below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 3,290 $ 2,495 $ 2,031 International 2,241 1,775 1,322 Consolidated $ 5,531 $ 4,270 $ 3,353 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 32 % 23 % 33 % International 26 34 42 Consolidated 30 27 37 Gross Margin: North America 25.6 % 24.4 % 25.1 % International 19.2 19.9 19.6 Consolidated 22.6 22.3 22.6 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by other sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 30%, 28%, and 28% of unit sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates see Effect of Exchange Rates below. North America segment gross margins in 2009 increased by 125 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing, 26 Table of Contents and increases in sales of products by other sellers, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. North America segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing. International segment gross margins in 2009 decreased by 67 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in sales of products by other sellers. International segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 924 $ 835 $ 740 Outbound shipping costs (1,773 ) (1,465 ) (1,174 ) Net shipping cost $ (849 ) $ (630 ) $ (434 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 11 % 13 % 31 % Outbound shipping costs 21 25 33 Net shipping cost 35 45 37 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.8 % 4.4 % 5.0 % Outbound shipping costs (7.2 ) (7.6 ) (7.9 ) Net shipping cost (3.4 )% (3.2 )% (2.9 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 27 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 5,964 $ 5,350 $ 4,630 Electronics and other general merchandise 6,314 4,430 3,139 Other (1) 550 448 326 Total North America $ 12,828 $ 10,228 $ 8,095 International Media $ 6,810 $ 5,734 $ 4,612 Electronics and other general merchandise 4,768 3,110 2,071 Other (1) 103 94 57 Total International $ 11,681 $ 8,938 $ 6,740 Consolidated Media $ 12,774 $ 11,084 $ 9,242 Electronics and other general merchandise 11,082 7,540 5,210 Other (1) 653 542 383 Total consolidated $ 24,509 $ 19,166 $ 14,835 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 11 % 16 % 29 % Electronics and other general merchandise 43 41 55 Other 23 38 24 Total North America 25 26 38 International Media 19 % 24 % 32 % Electronics and other general merchandise 53 50 55 Other 9 65 186 Total International 31 33 39 Consolidated Media 15 % 20 % 31 % Electronics and other general merchandise 47 45 55 Other 20 42 35 Total consolidated 28 29 39 Year over year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 20 % 22 % 25 % Electronics and other general merchandise 56 49 45 Other 19 67 165 Total International 33 31 31 Consolidated Media 16 % 19 % 27 % Electronics and other general merchandise 48 44 51 Other 22 42 34 Total consolidated 29 28 35 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 52 % 58 % 62 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 39 35 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as marketing and promotional activities, Amazon Web Services, other seller sites, and our co branded credit card agreements. 28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2009 Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 2,052 $ (79 ) $ 1,973 $ 1,658 $ (61 ) $ 1,597 $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 Marketing 680 (20 ) 660 482 (13 ) 469 344 (8 ) 336 Technology and content 1,240 (182 ) 1,058 1,033 (151 ) 882 818 (103 ) 715 General and administrative 328 (60 ) 268 279 (50 ) 229 235 (35 ) 200 Other operating expense (income), net 102 102 (24 ) (24 ) 9 9 Total operating expenses $ 4,402 $ (341 ) $ 4,061 $ 3,428 $ (275 ) $ 3,153 $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 24 % 24 % 28 % 27 % 38 % 37 % Marketing 41 41 40 39 31 30 Technology and content 20 20 26 23 23 17 General and administrative 17 17 19 15 20 13 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.6 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.4 % Marketing 2.8 2.7 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 5.1 4.3 5.4 4.6 5.5 4.8 General and administrative 1.3 1.1 1.5 1.2 1.6 1.3 Operating expenses without stock based compensation are non GAAP financial measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2009 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We periodically evaluate our facility requirements. 29 Table of Contents Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program and sponsored search programs. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See Overview for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2009, 2008, and 2007, we capitalized $187 million, $187 million, and $129 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $172 million, $143 million, and $116 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation was $341 million, $275 million, and $185 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in stock based compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. The increase in stock based compensation in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in total stock based compensation value granted to our employees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, was $102 million, $(24) million and $9 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The increase in other operating expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to the $51 million Toysrus.com LLC settlement, and increased amortization expense on acquired intangibles. In 2008, we recognized a $53 million noncash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $37 million, $83 million, and $90 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. 30 Table of Contents The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long term debt instruments. Interest expense was $34 million, $71 million, and $77 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of $319 million in 2009 and $899 million in 2008. Our long term debt was $109 million and $409 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Long Term Debt. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Foreign currency gain on intercompany balances $ 5 $ 23 $ 32 Foreign currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS 16 15 (33 ) Other 8 9 (7 ) Other income (expense), net $ 29 $ 47 $ (8 ) Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $253 million, $247 million, and $184 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The effective tax rate in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including our accuracy in predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits, net operating losses, and tax credits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 24,691 $ (182 ) $ 24,509 $ 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 Gross profit 5,605 (74 ) 5,531 4,240 30 4,270 3,274 79 3,353 Operating expenses 4,435 (33 ) 4,402 3,408 20 3,428 2,648 50 2,698 Income from operations 1,170 (41 ) 1,129 832 10 842 626 29 655 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 6 26 32 17 42 59 5 5 Net income 911 (9 ) 902 609 36 645 456 20 476 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.06 $ (0.02 ) $ 2.04 $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 $ 1.07 $ 0.05 $ 1.12 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. 31 Table of Contents (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments, and remeasurement of our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measure of Free cash flow meets the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for 2009, 2008, and 2007 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,293 $ 1,697 $ 1,405 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (373 ) (333 ) (224 ) Free cash flow $ 2,920 $ 1,364 $ 1,181 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (2,337 ) $ (1,199 ) $ 42 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (280 ) $ (198 ) $ 50 In addition, we provide information regarding our operating expenses with and without stock based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the Fulfillment, Technology and content, Marketing, and General and administrative line items would be higher. 32 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on January 28, 2010 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2010 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $6.45 billion and $7.00 billion, or to grow between 32% and 43% compared with first quarter 2009. Operating income is expected to be between $275 million and $365 million, or to grow between 13% and 50% compared with first quarter 2009. This guidance includes approximately $110 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. As noted in Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, we are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2009 13 as of January 1, 2010. The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in our first quarter 2010 guidance. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 33 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our current and long term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2009 (in millions, except percentages): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2009 Money market funds $ 2,750 $ $ $ $ $ $ 2,750 $ 2,750 Weighted average interest rate 0.09 % 0.09 % Corporate debt securities 45 109 42 6 202 211 Weighted average interest rate 1.39 % 1.87 % 2.57 % 2.98 % 1.94 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 551 213 453 14 9 1,240 1,268 Weighted average interest rate 0.24 % 1.57 % 1.83 % 3.27 % 3.12 % 1.10 % Asset backed securities 11 21 12 44 46 Weighted average interest rate 1.84 % 3.81 % 3.54 % 3.25 % Foreign government and agency securities 1,549 102 287 36 8 1,982 1,999 Weighted average interest rate 0.40 % 1.13 % 1.54 % 1.98 % 2.45 % 0.64 % Other securities 6 6 6 Weighted average interest rate 1.69 % 1.69 % $ 4,906 $ 451 $ 794 $ 56 $ 17 $ $ 6,224 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 6,280 The following table provides information about our current and long term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2008 (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2008 Money market funds $ 1,682 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,682 $ 1,682 Weighted average interest rate 0.78 % 0.78 % Corporate debt securities 17 44 103 19 11 194 194 Weighted average interest rate 5.35 % 5.06 % 4.93 % 5.23 % 5.42 % 5.06 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 463 47 58 11 7 586 594 Weighted average interest rate 0.36 % 2.09 % 2.29 % 3.61 % 3.80 % 0.79 % Asset backed securities 10 28 20 5 63 58 Weighted average interest rate 8.24 % 9.32 % 8.22 % 6.32 % 8.58 % Foreign government and agency securities 915 42 39 62 63 1,121 1,128 Weighted average interest rate 1.41 % 3.58 % 4.02 % 3.71 % 3.75 % 1.84 % Other securities 2 10 9 21 23 Weighted average interest rate 3.17 % 1.25 % 2.30 % 1.87 % $ 3,089 $ 171 $ 220 $ 106 $ 81 $ $ 3,667 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 3,679 34 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2009, net sales from our International segment accounted for 48% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2009, International segment revenues decreased $174 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2009 of $2.8 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $140 million, $275 million, and $550 million. All investments are classified as available for sale. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2009 of $260 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $15 million, $25 million, and $50 million, recorded to Other income (expense), net. See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2009, our recorded basis in equity investments was $91 million. These investments primarily relate to equity method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other than temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 35 Table of Contents
