Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell the Kindle e reader. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as AWS, fulfillment, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, such as online advertising, and co branded credit cards. Our financial focus is on long term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 465 million and 461 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and 1 Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below. 19 Table of Contents preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and AWS; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and our Kindle e reader; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts available to us from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 11, 12, and 12 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 72, 68, and 62 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support AWS. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. We are investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business, and in our Kindle e reader. A continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 20 Table of Contents For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first in first out (FIFO) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $33 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2010 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to 21 Table of Contents determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2010 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $17 million impact on our 2010 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were 29.7% and 33.1%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity of estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable, the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity.

Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, was $2.52 billion for 2010, compared to $2.92 billion and $1.36 billion for 2009 and 2008. See Results of Operations Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2010 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and utilization of excess stock based compensation deductions, partially offset by increases in operating income. The increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital, increased operating income, and increased deferred revenue. Tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows; accordingly, as such tax benefits decline, a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $8.8 billion, $6.4 billion, and $3.7 billion, at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $3.4 billion, $2.8 billion, and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion, $3.3 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, and our co branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital, including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns, as well as changes to non cash items such as excess stock based compensation and deferred taxes. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal use software and website development costs, and cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(3.4) billion, $(2.3) billion, and $(1.2) billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008, with the variability caused primarily by increased capital expenditures, increases in cash paid for acquisitions, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments. Capital expenditures were $979 million, $373 million, and $333 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure including AWS, additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, and, in 2010, investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue over time. 23 Table of Contents Capital expenditures included $176 million, $146 million, and $128 million for internal use software and website development during 2010, 2009, and 2008. Stock based compensation capitalized for internal use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $352 million, $40 million, and $494 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $181 million, $(280) million, and $(198) million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Cash outflows from financing activities result from payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, repayments of long term debt, and repurchases of common stock. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, and repayments of long term debt, were $221 million, $472 million, and $355 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions and proceeds from long term debt. Proceeds from long term debt and other were $143 million, $87 million, and $98 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows (outflows) from tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions were $259 million, $105 million, and $159 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. In 2010, 2009, and 2008 we recorded net tax provisions of $352 million, $253 million, and $247 million. A majority of this provision is non cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating loss carryforwards relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $75 million, $48 million, and $53 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of $227 million. Once we use our credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, which replaces the prior February 2008 repurchase authorization described above. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2010 or 2009. Additionally, in November 2010 and January 2011, we signed agreements to acquire Quidsi, Inc. and LOVEFiLM International Limited for aggregate consideration of approximately $660 million, primarily in cash, and the assumption of debt. We expect the acquisitions to close in 2011, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non inventory commitments, were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. On average, our high inventory turnover means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 11, 12, and 12 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including category expansion and changes in our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further 24 Table of Contents strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 18,707 $ 12,828 $ 10,228 International 15,497 11,681 8,938 Consolidated $ 34,204 $ 24,509 $ 19,166 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America 46 % 25 % 26 % International 33 31 33 Consolidated 40 28 29 Year over year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 46 % 26 % 26 % International 34 33 31 Consolidated 40 29 28 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 52 % 53 % International 45 48 47 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales increased 40%, 28%, and 29% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected net sales by $(86) million, $(182) million, and $127 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates, see Effect of Exchange Rates below. The North America sales growth rate was 46%, 25%, and 26% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, and, in 2010, our adoption of the new accounting standard update (ASU) 2009 13 (see Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies). Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, by increased in stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, and by the impact of Zappos, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009. 25 Table of Contents The International sales growth rate was 33%, 31%, and 33% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales and a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and by increased in stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected International net sales by $(107) million, $(174) million, and $131 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 31%, 30%, and 28% of unit sales in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount. Because we focus on operating profits, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 1,193 $ 924 $ 835 Outbound shipping costs (2,579 ) (1,773 ) (1,465 ) Net shipping cost $ (1,386 ) $ (849 ) $ (630 ) Year over year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 29 % 11 % 13 % Outbound shipping costs 45 21 25 Net shipping cost 63 35 45 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.5 % 3.8 % 4.4 % Outbound shipping costs (7.5 ) (7.2 ) (7.6 ) Net shipping cost (4.0 )% (3.4 )% (3.2 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including through membership in Amazon Prime; to the extent our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category; to the extent we reduce shipping rates; and to the extent we use more expensive shipping methods. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free shipping offers, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. 26 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 6,881 $ 5,964 $ 5,350 Electronics and other general merchandise 10,998 6,314 4,430 Other (1) 828 550 448 Total North America $ 18,707 $ 12,828 $ 10,228 International Media $ 8,007 $ 6,810 $ 5,734 Electronics and other general merchandise 7,365 4,768 3,110 Other (1) 125 103 94 Total International $ 15,497 $ 11,681 $ 8,938 Consolidated Media $ 14,888 $ 12,774 $ 11,084 Electronics and other general merchandise 18,363 11,082 7,540 Other (1) 953 653 542 Total consolidated $ 34,204 $ 24,509 $ 19,166 Year over year Percentage Growth: North America Media 15 % 11 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 74 43 41 Other 50 23 38 Total North America 46 25 26 International Media 18 % 19 % 24 % Electronics and other general merchandise 54 53 50 Other 22 9 65 Total International 33 31 33 Consolidated Media 17 % 15 % 20 % Electronics and other general merchandise 66 47 45 Other 46 20 42 Total consolidated 40 28 29 Year over year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 18 % 20 % 22 % Electronics and other general merchandise 57 56 49 Other 24 19 67 Total International 34 33 31 Consolidated Media 16 % 16 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 67 48 44 Other 46 22 42 Total consolidated 40 29 28 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 43 % 52 % 58 % Electronics and other general merchandise 54 45 39 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non retail activities, such as AWS, miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities, other seller sites, and our co branded credit card agreements. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2010 Year ended December 31, 2009 Year ended December 31, 2008 AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Cost of Sales $ 26,561 $ $ 26,561 $ 18,978 $ $ 18,978 $ 14,896 $ $ 14,896 Fulfillment 2,898 (90 ) 2,808 2,052 (79 ) 1,973 1,658 (61 ) 1,597 Marketing 1,029 (27 ) 1,002 680 (20 ) 660 482 (13 ) 469 Technology and content 1,734 (223 ) 1,511 1,240 (182 ) 1,058 1,033 (151 ) 882 General and administrative 470 (84 ) 386 328 (60 ) 268 279 (50 ) 229 Other operating expense (income), net 106 106 102 102 (24 ) (24 ) Total operating expenses $ 32,798 $ (424 ) $ 32,375 $ 23,380 $ (341 ) $ 23,039 $ 18,324 $ (275 ) $ 18,049 Year over year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 41 % 42 % 24 % 24 % 28 % 27 % Marketing 51 52 41 41 40 39 Technology and content 40 43 20 20 26 23 General and administrative 44 45 17 17 19 15 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.5 % 8.2 % 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.6 % 8.3 % Marketing 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.5 2.4 Technology and content 5.1 4.4 5.1 4.3 5.4 4.6 General and administrative 1.4 1.1 1.3 1.1 1.5 1.2 Operating expenses without stock based compensation are non GAAP financial measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Item 8 of Part I, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and content where we are the seller of record, inbound and outbound shipping charges, and packaging supplies. Shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. 28 Table of Contents Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Gross Profit (in millions) $ 7,643 $ 5,531 $ 4,270 Gross Margin 22.3 % 22.6 % 22.3 % Gross margin for 2010 remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with sales volume, inventory levels, and product sales mix; payment processing and related transaction costs; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as sponsored search programs and our Associates program, and, in 2010, on television advertising. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support AWS. See Overview for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. 29 Table of Contents The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and increased spending on technology infrastructure. We expect these trends to continue over time. For the years ended 2010, 2009, and 2008, we capitalized $213 million, $187 million, and $187 million of costs associated with internal use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $184 million, $172 million, and $143 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure and other technology costs used to support AWS are included in technology and content. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation was $424 million, $341 million, and $275 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. The increase in stock based compensation in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in total stock based compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. The increase in stock based compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $106 million, $102 million, and $(24) million during 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2010, the amount primarily related to amortization of intangible assets, in 2009, the amount included amortization of intangible assets and a $51 million legal settlement, and in 2008, the balance included amortization of intangible assets and a $53 million noncash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $51 million, $37 million, and $83 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. The primary component of our net interest expense is related to our capital and financing leases and our long term debt. Interest expense was $39 million, $34 million, and $71 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The decline in 2009 primarily relates to principal reductions of long term debt of $319 million. Our long term liabilities were $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Long Term Liabilities. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $79 million, $29 million, and $47 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. The primary component of other income (expense), net, is related to foreign currency gain on intercompany balances. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $352 million, $253 million, and $247 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The effective tax rate in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. We used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of $227 million. As a result of new U.S. legislation that became effective in December 2010, we are able to accelerate our depreciation deductions for qualifying property acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010. This accelerated depreciation deduction will continue for qualifying property acquired in 2011. EquityMethod Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equitymethod investment activity, net of tax, was $7 million, $(6) million, and $(9) million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The increase in equity method investment activity in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the recognition of a non cash gain on a previously held equity position in a company that was acquired in 2010. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2010 Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 34,290 $ (86 ) $ 34,204 $ 24,691 $ (182 ) $ 24,509 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 Operating expenses 32,856 (58 ) 32,798 23,522 (142 ) 23,380 18,206 118 18,324 Income from operations 1,434 (28 ) 1,406 1,170 (41 ) 1,129 832 10 842 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 17 74 91 6 26 32 17 42 59 Net income 1,118 34 1,152 911 (9 ) 902 609 36 645 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.45 $ 0.08 $ 2.53 $ 2.06 $ (0.02 ) $ 2.04 $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross currency investments, and remeasurement of our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. 31 Table of Contents Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non GAAP financial information. Our measures of Free cash flow, operating expenses with and without stock based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statement of operations, meet the definition of non GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, is cash flow from operations reduced by Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for 2010, 2009, and 2008 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,495 $ 3,293 $ 1,697 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal use software and website development (979 ) (373 ) (333 ) Free cash flow $ 2,516 $ 2,920 $ 1,364 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (3,360 ) $ (2,337 ) $ (1,199 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 181 $ (280 ) $ (198 ) Operating expenses with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation, which is non cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally incurred operating costs, stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the Fulfillment, Technology and content, Marketing, and General and administrative line items would be higher. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. 32 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on January 27, 2011 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8 K as follows: First Quarter 2011 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, or to grow between 28% and 39% compared with first quarter 2010. Operating income is expected to be between $260 million and $385 million, or between 34% decline and 2% decline compared with first quarter 2010. This guidance includes approximately $140 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities and AAA rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2010 (in millions, except percentages): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2010 Money market funds $ 1,882 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,882 $ 1,882 Weighted average interest rate 0.11 % 0.11 % Corporate debt securities 90 128 219 1 438 459 Weighted average interest rate 1.11 % 1.58 % 2.01 % 2.57 % 1.70 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 2,624 950 137 1 3,712 3,756 Weighted average interest rate 0.17 % 0.72 % 1.57 % 2.86 % 0.36 % Asset backed securities 13 12 7 32 33 Weighted average interest rate 2.18 % 1.83 % 2.01 % 2.01 % Foreign government and agency securities 1,346 410 337 30 2,123 2,158 Weighted average interest rate 0.37 % 0.84 % 1.28 % 1.66 % 0.62 % Other securities 10 5 1 16 17 Weighted average interest rate 1.05 % 1.34 % 2.03 % 1.22 % $ 5,965 $ 1,505 $ 701 $ 32 $ $ $ 8,203 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 8,305 33 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2010, net sales from our International segment accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2010, International segment revenues decreased $107 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2010 of $3.4 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $172 million, $345 million, and $689 million. All investments are classified as available for sale. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2010, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign currency exchange rates would result in losses of $40 million, $90 million, and $195 million, recorded to Other income (expense), net. See Item 7 of Part II, Effect of Exchange Rates, for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2010, our recorded basis in equity investments was $279 million. These investments primarily relate to equity method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other than temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 34 Table of Contents
