ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the "Introduction," "Recent Developments," "Business Strategy," and "Risk Factors" sections of this Form 10 K and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AutoNation, Inc. is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2001, we owned and operated 368 new vehicle franchises from 278 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our dealerships, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known dealerships in our key markets, sell 35 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 95% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2001, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services beyond new vehicles, such as used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, insurance products and other aftermarket products, and we arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing redundant operating expenses, improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across our dealerships. 19 Floorplan interest expense, which previously was classified as interest expense below operating income, is now presented as a component of cost of operations in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements to provide more meaningful information regarding our margin performance. In addition, loan and lease underwriting losses (income) related to our finance and lease underwriting businesses, which we have exited, have been presented separately for all periods presented in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. The following is a summary of our Consolidated Income Statements both in gross dollars and on a diluted per share basis for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share data): 2001 2000 1999 DILUTED DILUTED DILUTED PER PER PER DOLLARS SHARE DOLLARS SHARE DOLLARS SHARE Income (loss) from continuing operations........ $245.0 $ .73 $328.1 $ .91 $(31.5) $(.07) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes: Automotive rental.............................

Since 1999, we have not completed and do not expect to complete acquisitions at the same pace as we had in the past. See further discussion under the heading "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures". Non core Divestitures: From 1999 through 2001, we divested of various non core assets and dealerships, including the Flemington dealership group and our former outdoor media business for net proceeds of $59.0 million and $89.0 million, respectively. See further discussion under heading "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures". Spin Off of ANC Rental Corporation: In June 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of our former automotive rental business. ANC Rental declared bankruptcy in November 2001. We were called on to perform under certain of our credit enhancements and guarantees and, accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million included in Income from Discontinued Operations to reflect our assumption of these obligations. See further discussion under the heading "Discontinued Business Segments". Exit from Auto Loan Underwriting Businesses: In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of $85.8 million to reflect a write down of outstanding auto loans and related assets in our retail auto loan portfolio and to cover costs associated with our exit from the auto loan underwriting business. See further discussion under the heading "Auto Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities". Restructuring and Impairment Charges: In 1999, we restructured certain of our operations to exit our former used vehicle megastore business and to reduce our corporate workforce. See further discussion under the heading "Restructuring Activities". Share Repurchases: Since the inception of our Board authorized share repurchase programs in 1998 through December 31, 2001, we have repurchased 155.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $1.7 billion, leaving approximately $260.3 million available for repurchases under the programs, including an additional $250.0 million authorized in October 2001 by our Board of Directors. See further discussion under the heading "Financial Condition". 20 Investment Write down: In 2000, we recognized a pre tax $30.0 million valuation write down to an equity method investment in a privately held salvage and parts recycling business, as well as a $5.0 million write down to fair value of another equity method investment, subsequently sold in early 2001 at no additional gain or loss. Sale of Republic Services, Inc.: In 1998, our former solid waste services business completed an initial public offering of 36.1% of its common stock. In 1999, we sold substantially all of our remaining interests in Republic Services to the public. See further discussion under the heading "Discontinued Business Segments". The following table provides a detailed reconciliation of how certain after tax charges and gains have impacted reported Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations for the periods indicated (in millions, except earnings per share data): 2001 2000 1999 DILUTED DILUTED DILUTED PER PER PER DOLLARS SHARE DOLLARS SHARE DOLLARS SHARE(1) Income (loss) from continuing operations, as reported..... $245.0 $ .73 $328.1 $ .91 $(31.5) $(.07) Certain charges and gains: Asset impairment and related charges loan underwriting business.............................................. 52.3 .16 Gain on sale of outdoor media business..................

Income from Continuing Operations, Excluding Certain Charges and Gains above is presented on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The above information is presented for informational purposes only and may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations. Unless otherwise stated, the following discussions will focus on the results of continuing operations as reported, which consists of our automotive retail business. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. We have identified the policies below that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventory Our inventory policy determines the valuation of inventory, which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Inventory consists primarily of retail vehicles held for sale valued using the specific identification method, net of reserves. Cost includes acquisition, reconditioning and transportation expenses. Reserves are established based on vehicle inventory aging and managements estimate of market values. We are subject to the risk that our inventory may be overvalued from time to time primarily with respect to used vehicles, which could require additional reserves to be recorded. 21 Intangible Assets Our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible assets, which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment expenses we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. The cost in excess of the fair value of net assets is amortized over forty years on a straight line basis. In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), and Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but, instead are subject to impairment tests at least annually. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. During 2002, we will perform the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. We will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of SFAS 142 on our consolidated financial statements until such time as we apply its provisions. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As further discussed in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we are involved, and will continue to be involved, in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with customers, employment related lawsuits, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves and assert available defenses with respect to each of these matters. Where necessary, we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these proceedings based on consultation with outside counsel, assuming various strategies. Further, we have certain insurance coverage and rights of indemnification with respect to certain aspects of these matters. However, a settlement or an adverse resolution of one or more of these matters may result in the payment of significant costs and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In June 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of our former automotive rental business, ANC Rental. ANC Rental declared bankruptcy in November 2001. We were called on to perform under certain of our credit enhancements and guarantees and, accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million included in Income from Discontinued Operations primarily to reflect our assumption of these obligations. Additional remaining potential pre tax financial exposure related to ANC Rental may be in the range of $25.0 million to $60.0 million. However, the exposure is difficult to estimate and we cannot assure you that our aggregate obligations under these credit enhancements, guarantees and ANC Rental Agreements will not be materially above the range indicated above or that we will not be subject to additional claims as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy filing. See further discussion under the heading "Discontinued Business Segments". Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles, including any commissions from related vehicle financings. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. Commission revenue on warranty and insurance products sold in connection with vehicle sales is recognized upon sale. Additionally, we may reinsure some or all of the underwriting risk related to extended warranty and credit insurance products sold and administered by certain independent third parties through our captive insurance subsidiaries. Revenue and related direct costs from these reinsurance transactions are deferred and recognized over the life of the policies. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. In the future, should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria have not been met, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected. Finance and Lease Underwriting Through our subsidiary, AutoNation Financial Services, until December 2001, we underwrote installment auto loans to our customers and, until mid 1999, we provided our customers an opportunity to finance vehicles through leases with us. In December 2001, we decided that we 22 would no longer underwrite retail auto loans for customers at our dealerships. We incurred a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 of $85.8 million to reflect a write down of our outstanding auto loans and related assets in our portfolio and to cover costs associated with our exit from that business. However, we will continue to manage and wind down our outstanding loan portfolio and related assets. Accordingly, we remain subject to consumer credit risk in connection with our portfolio of installment receivables, our lease portfolio and other related assets. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that based on certain estimates and assumptions used, our portfolio of installment receivables, our lease portfolio and other related assets could be overvalued and require additional write down. See further discussion in Note 12, Finance Underwriting and Asset Securitizations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). In 1997 and 1999, we engaged in certain transactions that are of a type that the Internal Revenue Service has indicated it intends to challenge. Approximately $680 million of the net deferred tax liabilities relate to these transactions, including a significant portion that relates to a transaction that generally had the effect of accelerating certain future projected tax deductions. The amount of foregone tax deductions in 2001 relating to that transaction was approximately $44 million. These transactions are currently under review by the Internal Revenue Service. We believe that our tax returns appropriately reflect such transactions, and that we have established adequate reserves with respect to any tax liabilities relating to these transactions. However, an unfavorable settlement or adverse resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 23 Reported Operating Data: Our historical operating results include the results of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

Percentages are not meaningful. Total revenue was $20.0 billion, $20.6 billion and $20.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gross margins were $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The primary components of these changes are described below. New vehicle revenue decreased 3.9% to $12.0 billion in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a decrease in volume of 7.2% partially offset by an increase in average revenue per unit of 3.3%. On a same store basis, new vehicle revenue decreased 4.5%. On a same store basis, our new vehicle sales were primarily affected during 2001 by the lower demand experienced in the domestic product lines. New vehicle sales came to a near standstill directly following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The introduction of significant manufacturer incentives greatly increased the pace of new vehicle sales during the final three months of 2001. We expect retail sales of new vehicles in the United States during 2002 to decrease by an estimated five to ten percent compared to 2001 on a unit basis. However, the level of retail sales of new vehicles during 2002 is very difficult to predict, as evidenced by various industry experts predicting a wide range of sales level decreases during 2002 as compared to 2001, and is likely to be significantly impacted by vehicle manufacturers 24 willingness to continue significant incentive programs. A significant change in new vehicle sales levels in the United States during 2002 as compared to our expectations could cause our actual earnings results to differ from our projected results. In 2000, new vehicle sales were strong until the fourth quarter when new vehicle demand dramatically slowed. New vehicle sales in 2000 were also impacted by a modest decrease in same store unit sales. New vehicle gross margin reflects the net result of the sales price from the sale of a vehicle less the cost of acquisition, including vehicle net carrying costs (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Driven by the revenue decrease, new vehicle gross margin decreased 2.3% to $837.9 million in 2001 compared to 2000. However, on a percentage basis, new vehicle gross margin improved 10 basis points to 7.0% in 2001 compared to 2000 in part due to our inventory management activities which resulted in manufacturers floorplan assistance in excess of floorplan interest expense. While we expect floorplan interest rates to increase in 2002 compared to 2001, we believe its effect will be largely mitigated by increases in floorplan interest assistance which is also interest rate sensitive. Gross margin in 2000 increased 2.2% compared to 1999 as a result of higher average revenue per unit and acquisitions and divestitures. Used vehicle revenue increased .6% to $3.9 billion in 2001 compared to 2000. On a same store basis, revenue increased 2.1%, attributable to higher volume of 2.9% partially offset by .8% lower average revenue per unit. Despite the increase in revenue, used vehicle gross margin decreased 2.5% to $426.5 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Gross margin decreased .7% on a same store basis in 2001 compared to 2000. The gross margin compression of 30 basis points to 11.0% resulted from our focus during 2001 on reducing inventory levels as part of our inventory management initiative and the increase in used vehicles we took as trade ins as a result of the increase in new vehicle sales at the end of 2001. Due to an uncertain wholesale market, we chose to retail our used vehicle inventory whenever possible, which resulted in lower used vehicle gross margins. The margin compression was partially offset by continued improvements due to the implementation of our used vehicle best practices. Decreases in used vehicle revenue and gross margin amounts in 2000 are the result of a decrease in units retailed from 315,000 in 1999 to 255,000 in 2000 which largely resulted from the closure of our used vehicle megastores. In addition, the used vehicle market was softer in 2000 compared to 1999 due in part to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles, especially light trucks. Used vehicle gross margin percentages in 2000 increased compared to 1999 primarily as a result of the initial implementation of our used vehicle best practices and improved management of used vehicle inventories. Parts and service revenue increased 3.0% to $2.4 billion in 2001 compared to 2000 driven by volume as well as price increases. Parts and service gross margin increased 4.0% to $1.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of higher revenue coupled with margin expansion of 40 basis points to 43.2%. Revenue and gross margin increased 3.7% and 4.7% in 2001 compared to 2000 on a same store basis, respectively. Both the revenue increase and the margin expansion are the result of our initiatives to implement a pricing strategy, a team based process and a comprehensive parts and service marketing plan. Parts and service revenue increased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily driven by volume. Parts and service gross margin increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of higher revenue coupled with margin expansion. Finance and insurance revenue and gross margin increased 13.4% to $489.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Finance and insurance revenue and gross margin increased 2.0% to $431.8 million in 2000 compared to 1999. Finance and insurance gross margin per vehicle retailed increased 18.6% in 2001 to $688 compared to $580 in 2000. The increases are primarily due to a higher percentage of our customers buying finance and insurance products as well as increased pricing primarily as a result of the implementation of a customer friendly "full disclosure" finance and insurance menu and standardized closing process. Other revenue, primarily consisting of wholesale revenue from wholesaling used vehicles, decreased 18.3% to $1.2 billion in 2001 compared to 2000. This revenue decrease primarily reflects a reduction in wholesale revenues due to a decrease in the number of units wholesaled as we reduced our used vehicle inventory levels from 2000 and retailed a greater proportion of used vehicles. Other gross margin decreased 15.8% to $80.7 million in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of a reduction in wholesale and fleet revenue. 25 Store selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.5% to $2.1 billion in 2001 compared to 2000. Store selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 10.4% in 2001 versus 9.8% in 2000. This increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a shift in revenue mix from new vehicles to used vehicles, parts and service, and finance and insurance for which the related costs as a percentage of revenue are higher. Generally store selling, general and administrative expenses increase and decrease in direct relation to gross margin. Store selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total gross margins were 72.1% in 2001 versus 71.6% in 2000. The increase in store selling, general and administrative expenses during 2001 was driven by an increase in total gross margin as well as increased advertising and other miscellaneous expenses. The decrease in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily due to the successful implementation of our cost cutting initiatives in late 1999 and overall leveraging of the store cost structure. Store performance was $801.9 million, $800.5 million and $701.2 million or, as percentages of total revenue, 4.0%, 3.9% or 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2000 increase in aggregate dollars is primarily due to acquisitions coupled with margin expansion. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses were $135.2 million, $156.1 million and $190.0 million or, as a percentage of total revenue, .7%, .8% and .9% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 decrease is primarily the result of the continued disposal of excess properties. In 2001, $6.6 million of property carrying costs were incurred compared to $30.9 million in 2000. Property carrying costs for properties held for sale for 2002 are estimated to be $1.5 million. The 2000 decrease in corporate S,G&A is primarily due to successful implementation of our cost cutting initiatives in late 1999. In 2002, we will focus on cost management initiatives in the areas of compensation, advertising and general and administrative expenses. However, we expect an increase in insurance and benefit costs in 2002 compared to 2001, which would have the effect of offsetting some of these expected cost savings. Depreciation and amortization were $151.9 million, $133.8 million and $123.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Depreciation and amortization as percentages of revenue were .8%, .7% and .6% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The increases are primarily the result of capital expenditures. As further discussed under the heading "New Accounting Pronouncements", we are currently analyzing the impact of SFAS 142. Based on preliminary estimates, substantially all of our amortization expenses will be eliminated. Loan and lease underwriting losses (income) were $89.6 million, $6.0 million and $(12.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See discussion under heading "Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities". Restructuring and impairment charges (recoveries), net were $4.5 million, $(20.4) million and $416.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See discussion under heading "Restructuring Activities". Other gains for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $19.3 million primarily consists of the pre tax gain from the sale of the Flemington dealer group in April 2001. Same Store Operating Data: We have presented below our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 on a same store basis to reflect our internal performance. Same store operating results include the results of businesses that were owned and operated by us during both of the years included in the comparison. The following table sets forth: (1) the components of same store revenue, with component percentages of total revenue; (2) the components of same store gross margin, with gross margin percentages of applicable 26 same store revenue; (3) same store selling, general and administrative expenses; (4) same store performance; and (5) retail vehicle same store unit sales: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 % 2000 % % VARIANCE ($ IN MILLIONS) Revenue: New vehicle..................................... $11,441.0 59.9 $11,974.5 61.2 (4.5) Used vehicle.................................... 3,701.1 19.4 3,625.8 18.5 2.1 Parts and service............................... 2,305.7 12.1 2,224.2 11.4 3.7 Finance and insurance, net...................... 463.8 2.4 411.8 2.1 12.6 Other........................................... 1,178.3 6.2 1,342.7 6.8 (12.2) Total revenue............................ $19,089.9 100.0 $19,579.0 100.0 (2.5) Gross margin: New vehicle..................................... $ 800.4 7.0 $ 827.9 6.9 (3.3) Used vehicle.................................... 407.5 11.0 410.5 11.3 (.7) Parts and service............................... 996.4 43.2 951.4 42.8 4.7 Finance and insurance........................... 463.8 100.0 411.8 100.0 12.6 Other........................................... 67.1 5.7 73.1 5.4 (8.2) Total gross margin....................... 2,735.2 14.3 2,674.7 13.7 2.3 S,G&A Store....................................... 1,963.1 10.3 1,909.8 9.8 2.8 Store performance........................ $ 772.1 4.0 $ 764.9 3.9 .9 Retail vehicle unit sales: New............................................. 431,000 470,000 (8.3) Used............................................ 246,000 239,000 2.9 677,000 709,000 (4.5) In 2001, same store performance improved by $7.2 million or .9% despite a 2.5% decrease in same store revenue. This was achieved through our focus on operational improvements in the high margin areas of our business used vehicle, parts and service, and finance and insurance. Although these areas collectively comprise 33.9% of total same store revenue, they contributed 68.3% of total same store gross margin in 2001. DISCONTINUED BUSINESS SEGMENTS On June 30, 2000, we completed the spin off of our former automotive rental businesses, which were organized under ANC Rental Corporation, by distributing 100% of ANC Rentals common stock to AutoNations stockholders as a tax free dividend. As a result of the spin off, AutoNation stockholders received one share of ANC Rental common stock for every eight shares of AutoNation common stock owned as of the June 16, 2000 record date. As discussed in Note 16, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, ANC Rental has been accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accordingly, the operating results of ANC Rental have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the spin off of ANC Rental Corporation and its subsidiaries ("ANC Rental") in June 2000, we agreed to provide certain guarantees and credit enhancements with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental, including acting as a guarantor under certain motor vehicle and real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, Inc. ("Mitsubishi") and acting as an indemnitor with respect to certain surety bonds issued on ANC Rentals behalf. We are also a party to certain agreements with ANC Rental (the "ANC Rental Agreements"), including a separation and distribution agreement, a reimbursement agreement and a tax sharing agreement, pursuant to which both ANC Rental and we have certain obligations. On November 13, 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. In connection with ANC Rentals bankruptcy, we were called on to perform under nine of the twelve real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi for which we provided guarantees. As a result, we agreed to assume these real property leases, which expire in 2017, in order to control and 27 attempt to mitigate our exposure relating thereto. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million included in net income from discontinued operations to reflect our assumption of the nine leases with Mitsubishi and certain other costs that we expect to incur as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy. We continue to guarantee the remaining three leases with Mitsubishi until their expiration in 2017, and we remain subject to various other ANC Rental obligations. ANC Rental has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and, accordingly, we expect that additional charges recorded by us pursuant to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees or with respect to claims under the ANC Rental Agreements, if any, would not impact our reported results from continuing operations. We have reached an agreement with Mitsubishi pursuant to which our aggregate financial exposure under a motor vehicle lease agreement between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi is capped at $10.0 million. Although we believe that our financial exposure under the agreement will likely decrease significantly in 2002, we could have potential exposure under the agreement for up to five to ten years. Our indemnification obligations with respect to the surety bonds issued on behalf of ANC Rental are capped at $29.5 million in the aggregate. We could have potential exposure under the indemnification obligations for approximately five years. Due to the bankruptcy of ANC Rental, obligations of ANC Rental to us under the terms of the ANC Rental Agreements may be extinguished or our claims against ANC Rental under such agreements may be unenforceable. These claims could include reimbursement obligations that ANC Rental may have to us in connection with payments made by us with respect to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees, as well as indemnification rights with respect to any payments that we make to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of audit adjustments in our consolidated federal income tax returns relating to ANC Rentals automotive rental businesses prior to the spin off. Such audit adjustments, if any, would likely be resolved in the next three to five years. We estimate that, based on our assessment of the risks involved in each matter and excluding the liabilities associated with the $20.0 million charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001, our remaining potential pre tax financial exposure related to ANC Rental may be in the range of $25.0 million to $60.0 million. However, the exposure is difficult to estimate and we cannot assure you that our aggregate obligations under these credit enhancements, guarantees and ANC Rental Agreements will not be materially above the range indicated above or that we will not be subject to additional claims as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy filing. In July 1998, our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, Inc., completed an initial public offering of 36.1% of its common stock. In May 1999, we sold substantially all of our interest in Republic Services in a public offering. As discussed in Note 16, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our former solid waste services segment has been accounted for as discontinued operations and accordingly, the operating results of Republic Services have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES From 1997 through 1999, we aggressively expanded our automotive retail operations through the acquisition of franchised automotive dealerships. Since 1999, we have not completed and do not expect to complete acquisitions at the same pace as we had in the past. We expect that future acquisitions will primarily target single dealerships or dealership groups focused in key existing markets. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, we acquired various automotive retail businesses. We paid approximately $69.7 million, $190.9 million and $879.1 million, respectively, in cash for these acquisitions, all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We also paid $22.3 million, $122.4 million and $34.9 million, respectively, in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $11.6 million of deferred purchase price due to former owners of acquired businesses had been accrued. As described below under the heading "Restructuring Activities", we have divested of certain non core franchised automotive dealerships. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, we received $61.2 million, $89.7 million and $131.3 million, respectively, of cash from the divestiture of certain automotive dealerships. In April 2001, we completed the sale of our Flemington dealer group for net proceeds of $59.0 28 million. In the normal course of business, we will periodically divest dealerships that do not meet certain operational, financial, or strategic criteria. Revenue for the operations disposed or to be disposed, including the Flemington dealership group and our former used vehicle megastores, was $302.0 million, $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See discussion under heading "Restructuring Activities". Operating income (loss) for the operations disposed or to be disposed was $(2.7) million, $13.6 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In November 2000, we completed the divestiture of our outdoor media business for a purchase price of approximately $104.0 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a prepaid $15.0 million advertising agreement and, therefore, we received net proceeds of $89.0 million. A pre tax gain of $53.5 million was recognized on the sale. See Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of business combinations. LOAN AND LEASE UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our dealerships, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. We will continue to provide automobile loans for our customers through unrelated third party financing sources, which historically have provided more than 95% of the auto loans made to our customers. In addition, economic conditions in the United States worsened during the fourth quarter of 2001 as evidenced by confirmation of a recession, lower consumer confidence, increasing unemployment and increasing consumer credit defaults. The decision to exit the loan underwriting business and the impact of the economic conditions referenced above caused us to incur asset impairment and related charges totaling $85.8 million recorded in December 2001. These charges mainly reflect the impact of expected increases in loan losses and prepayments, as well as higher expected loan servicing costs. The charges also include $1.5 million of direct exit costs for asset write offs and other costs. In addition, during 2001 and 2000, we recognized impairment charges totaling $4.1 million and $16.6 million, respectively, primarily associated with the deterioration in residual values of finance lease receivables. We discontinued the writing of finance leases in mid 1999. Until December 2001, we securitized installment loan receivables through a commercial paper warehouse facility with unrelated financial institutions. In September 2001, we decreased the capacity of the commercial paper warehouse facility from $1.0 billion to $625.0 million. The warehouse facility had a renewable 364 day term and required an annual securitization transaction to reduce indebtedness. During 2001, we sold installment note receivables of $397.5 million under this program, net of retained interests. In December 2001, in conjunction with our exit from the auto loan underwriting business, we terminated this facility. During 2001, we entered into certain interest rate derivative transactions with certain financial institutions to manage the impact of interest rate changes on these securitized installment loan receivables. At December 31, 2001, since we terminated this facility, we had no derivative instruments outstanding. Until December 2001, we also securitized installment loan receivables through the issuance of asset backed notes through non consolidated qualified special purpose entities under a shelf registration statement. Proceeds from these notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper under the warehouse facility and to finance additional loans held by us. In August 2001, we amended the shelf registration statement relating to this program to provide aggregate capacity of $2.0 billion. During 2001, we issued $850.0 million in asset backed notes under this program, net of retained interests. We provide credit enhancements related to these notes in the form of 1% over collateralization, a reserve fund and a third party surety bond. We retain responsibility for servicing the loans, for which we are paid a servicing fee. We in turn have a sub servicing arrangement with a third party. At December 31, 2001, $1.3 billion was outstanding under this program, net of retained interests. With our decision to exit the loan underwriting business, we do not intend to utilize the remaining capacity under this program. Substantially all of the beneficial interests in the debt of the qualified special purpose entities are held by unrelated third parties. The investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due except to the extent of our remaining investments in securitizations. 29 At December 31, 2001, we had finance receivables totaling $175.7 million including investments in securitizations of $73.8 million, after the impact of the charge. The remaining finance leases, installment loans and investments in securitizations are expected to be substantially collected over the next three years. See discussion of key economic assumptions and other information in Note 12, Finance Underwriting and Asset Securitizations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES During the fourth quarter of 1999, we approved a plan to restructure certain of our operations. The restructuring plan was comprised of the following major components: (1) exiting the used vehicle megastore business; and (2) reducing the corporate workforce. The restructuring plan also included divesting of certain non core franchised dealerships. Approximately 2,000 positions were eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan of which 1,800 were megastore positions and 200 were corporate positions. These restructuring activities resulted in pre tax charges of $443.7 million in 1999 of which $416.4 million appears as Restructuring and Impairment Charges (Recoveries), Net in our 1999 Consolidated Income Statement. These pre tax charges include $286.9 million of asset impairment charges; $103.3 million of reserves for residual value guarantees for closed lease properties; $26.2 million of severance and other exit costs; and $27.3 million of inventory related costs. The $286.9 million asset impairment charge consists of: $244.9 million of megastore and other property impairments; $26.6 million of goodwill impairment reserves for the divestiture of certain non core franchised automotive dealerships; and $15.4 million of information systems impairments. Of the $443.7 million restructuring reserve recorded, $10.8 million of severance was paid in 1999 and $53.7 million of asset impairments and write offs were recorded during the fourth quarter of 1999. We continue to dispose of our closed megastores and other properties, including closed lease properties, through sales to third parties. At December 31, 2001, properties held for sale total $72.2 million, of which properties with total asset value of $69.4 million remain to be sold of the total $285.3 million identified as part of the restructuring plan. These properties continue to be aggressively marketed. The majority of these properties will be disposed of by the end of 2002. The following summarizes the activity in the restructuring and impairment reserves for the year ended December 31, 2001 (in millions): DEDUCTIONS BALANCE AMOUNTS CHARGED BALANCE RESERVE DECEMBER 31, 2000 (CREDITED) TO INCOME CASH NON CASH DECEMBER 31, 2001 Asset reserves: Asset impairment............... $161.4 $4.7 $ $(97.7) $68.4 Accrued liabilities: Severance and other exit costs........................ 1.2 (.2) (1.6) .8 .2 $162.6 $4.5 $(1.6) $(96.9) $68.6 The following summarizes the components of the $4.5 million charged to income during the year ended December 31, 2001 (in millions): NET GAIN ON ADDITIONAL SOLD PROPERTIES IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OTHER TOTAL Asset reserves: Asset impairment.................................... $(.6) $5.3 $ $4.7 Accrued liabilities: Severance and other exit costs...................... (.2) (.2) $(.6) $5.3 $(.2) $4.5 During 2001, we recognized an additional impairment charge totaling $5.3 million based on the re evaluation of the fair value of certain properties. 30 The following summarizes the activity in the restructuring and impairment reserves for the year ended December 31, 2000 (in millions): DEDUCTIONS BALANCE AMOUNT CHARGED BALANCE RESERVE DECEMBER 31, 1999 (CREDITED) TO INCOME CASH NON CASH DECEMBER 31, 2000 Asset reserves: Asset impairment............. $ 263.3(1) $(15.0) $ $ (86.9) $161.4 Inventory.................... 15.0 (15.0) Accrued liabilities: Property lease residual value guarantees................. 103.3 (14.8) (88.5) Severance and other exit costs...................... 17.3 9.4 (22.7) (2.8) 1.2 $ 398.9 $(20.4) $(111.2) $(104.7) $162.6 (1) Includes $19.7 million of reserves that had been established on these properties prior to the 1999 restructuring and impairment charges recorded. The following summarizes the components of the $20.4 million amount credited to income during the year ended December 31, 2000 (in millions): PROPERTIES PLACED BACK NET GAIN ON ADDITIONAL INTO SERVICE OR RETAINED SOLD PROPERTIES IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OTHER TOTAL Asset reserves: Asset impairment..................... $(23.2) $(3.4) $11.6 $ $(15.0) Accrued liabilities: Property lease residual value guarantees......................... (13.0) (1.8) (14.8) Severance and other exit costs..... 9.4 9.4 $(36.2) $(5.2) $11.6 $ 9.4 $(20.4) During 2000, certain events occurred which caused us to re evaluate our plans with respect to various retail properties. As a result, certain megastore properties were placed back in service and we decided to retain certain dealerships that had been held for sale. Accordingly, based on our re evaluation of the fair value of the properties, we determined that the asset impairment and lease residual value reserves for these properties were no longer necessary and we were required to reverse the related estimated reserves totaling $36.2 million back into income. An additional impairment charge of $11.6 million was recognized primarily related to a decision in 2000 to close one additional megastore property as part of the overall restructuring plan. NON OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE During 2001, other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, mortgage facilities and the outstanding senior unsecured notes sold in August 2001. See further discussion under heading "Financial Condition". Other interest expense was $43.7 million, $47.7 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in 2001 was due to lower average borrowings as well as lower floating interest rates partially offset by additional fixed interest expense related to the senior unsecured notes. The increase in 2000 is due to higher average borrowings along with higher interest rates. Going forward because of the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, we will be less sensitive to changing interest rates due to a higher ratio of fixed versus floating rate obligations. However, we expect other interest expense to increase in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the fixed interest expense. INTEREST INCOME Interest income was $9.0 million, $14.3 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates. The 2000 decrease is primarily due to lower cash and investment balances on hand. 31 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET For the year ended December 31, 2001, other expense, net, was $4.5 million. Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $33.4 million and primarily included gains of approximately $24.0 million on the sale of approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock of our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, and approximately $53.5 million on the sale of our former outdoor media business, offset by a $30.0 million valuation write down related to an equity method investment in a privately held salvage and parts recycling business as well as a $5.0 million write down to fair value of another equity method investment, subsequently sold in early 2001 at no additional gain or loss. Other Income (Expense), Net, for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $2.2 million. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $155.8 million, $196.9 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 38.9% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Although we reported a pre tax loss from continuing operations in 1999, an income tax provision of $4.0 million was recorded due to the effect of certain non deductible expenses primarily associated with the restructuring and impairment charges. We anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be approximately 38% to 39% in 2002. FINANCIAL CONDITION At December 31, 2001, we had $128.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We had a multi year unsecured revolving credit facility, which provided $1.0 billion of financing and was scheduled to mature in April 2002, that was repaid in full and terminated on August 10, 2001. Another facility provided $250.0 million of borrowing capacity until its termination on June 29, 2001. In August 2001, we entered into two new senior secured revolving credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $500.0 million. The 364 day revolving credit facility provides borrowing capacity up to $200.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate. The five year revolving credit facility provides borrowing capacity up to $300.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate. These revolving credit facilities are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, which directly or indirectly own substantially all of our dealerships, and are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. No amounts are drawn on these revolving credit facilities. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008 at a price of 98.731% of face value. The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. In conjunction with the revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes offering, we received corporate credit ratings from ratings agencies. The revolving credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes have provisions linked to credit ratings. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are impacted by changes in credit ratings and certain covenants related to the senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with certain upgrades in credit ratings. Accordingly, in the event of a downgrade in our credit rating, we would continue to have access to the revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes, but at higher rates of interest for the revolving credit facilities. In June 2001, we entered into a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary with an aggregate capacity of $150.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the amount outstanding under this mortgage facility was $115.0 million. The facility has a ten year term, bears interest at a LIBOR based rate and is secured by mortgages on certain of our dealerships real property. In October 2001, we entered into a mortgage facility with another automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary with an aggregate capacity of $150.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the amount outstanding under this mortgage facility was $38.4 million. The facility has a five year term, bears interest at a LIBOR based rate and is secured by mortgages on certain of our dealerships real property. We used the net proceeds of the note offering and additional borrowings under the new mortgage facilities to repay outstanding amounts under the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and certain other debt. We intend to use funds drawn from these facilities to make future capital investments in our current business, to 32 complete strategic dealership acquisitions, to repurchase our common stock and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We finance our vehicle inventory through secured financings, primarily floorplan facilities, with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries as well as independent financial institutions and, until 2001, a bank sponsored commercial paper conduit facility that matured January 19, 2001 and was not renewed. As of December 31, 2001, capacity of the facilities was approximately $3.5 billion. We finance our used vehicle inventory primarily through our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities. We were the lessee under a lease facility that was established to acquire and develop our former megastores properties. As originally structured, the facility was accounted for as an operating lease and included residual value guarantees. In 1999, certain properties under the facility were reflected as capital leases. In connection with our 1999 restructuring activities previously described, as of December 31, 1999 we accrued an estimate of the liability under the residual value guarantee totaling approximately $103.3 million. In 2000, due to amendments to the facility, all of the leases were accounted for as capital leases at December 31, 2000, with the property and related debt included in our consolidated balance sheet. In August 2001, we repaid the debt and terminated this facility. We offer our customers various vehicle protection products, such as extended service contracts, vehicle protection and maintenance programs, and insurance products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements by these third party finance and insurance product providers, we either sell the products on a straight commission basis or we sell the product, recognize commission and assume some or all of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. We have restricted cash and investments in trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our insurance captives. During 2001, we repurchased 27.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $256.8 million. Through December 31, 2001, an aggregate of 155.0 million shares of common stock have been repurchased under our share repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of $1.7 billion, leaving approximately $260.3 million available for share repurchases under the programs including an additional $250.0 million authorized in October 2001 by our Board of Directors. As of March 25, 2002, we repurchased an additional 2.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $30.0 million, leaving approximately $230.2 million available for share repurchases under the programs. We expect to continue repurchasing shares under this program. Repurchases are made pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares under these programs, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock, the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of our capital such as strategic dealership acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses. Our future share repurchases are also subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes and our credit agreements for our two senior secured revolving credit facilities. In connection with the ANC Rental spin off, we made certain capital contributions to ANC Rental prior to the spin off. These contributions included cash of approximately $200.0 million and the net assets of an insurance subsidiary. We also entered into various agreements with ANC Rental that set forth the terms of the distribution and other agreements governing our relationship with ANC Rental after the spin off. As a result of the spin off, our equity as of December 31, 2000, was reduced by the net assets of ANC Rental totaling $894.4 million. In connection with the spin off of ANC Rental in June 2000, we agreed to provide certain guarantees and credit enhancements with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental, including acting as a guarantor under certain motor vehicle and real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi and acting as an indemnitor with respect to certain surety bonds issued on ANC Rentals behalf. We are also a party to ANC Rental Agreements, including a separation and distribution agreement, a reimbursement agreement and a tax sharing agreement, pursuant to which both ANC Rental and we have 33 certain obligations. On November 13, 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. In connection with ANC Rentals bankruptcy, we were called on to perform under nine of the twelve real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi for which we provided guarantees. As a result, we agreed to assume these real property leases, which expire in 2017, in order to control and attempt to mitigate our exposure relating thereto. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million included in net income from discontinued operations to reflect our assumption of the nine leases with Mitsubishi and certain other costs that we expect to incur as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy. We continue to guarantee the remaining three leases with Mitsubishi until their expiration in 2017, and we remain subject to various other ANC Rental obligations. ANC Rental has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and, accordingly, we expect that additional charges recorded by us pursuant to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees or with respect to claims under the ANC Rental Agreements, if any, would not impact our reported results from continuing operations. We have reached an agreement with Mitsubishi pursuant to which our aggregate financial exposure relating to motor vehicles leased by ANC Rental from Mitsubishi is capped at $10.0 million. Although we believe our financial exposure under the agreement will likely decrease significantly in 2002, we could have potential exposure under the agreement for up to five to ten years. Our indemnification obligations with respect to the surety bonds issued on behalf of ANC Rental are capped at $29.5 million in the aggregate. We could have potential exposure under the indemnification obligations for approximately five years. Due to the bankruptcy of ANC Rental, obligations of ANC Rental to us under the terms of the ANC Rental Agreements may be extinguished or our claims against ANC Rental under such agreements may be unenforceable. These claims could include reimbursement obligations that ANC Rental may have to us in connection with payments made by us with respect to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees, as well as indemnification rights with respect to any payments that we make to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of audit adjustments in our consolidated federal income tax returns relating to ANC Rentals automotive rental businesses prior to the spin off. Such audit adjustments, if any, would likely be resolved in the next three to five years. We estimate that, based on our assessment of the risks involved in each matter and excluding the liabilities associated with the $20.0 million charge we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001, our remaining potential pre tax financial exposure related to ANC Rental may be in the range of $25.0 million to $60.0 million. However, the exposure is difficult to estimate and we cannot assure you that our aggregate obligations under these credit enhancements, guarantees and ANC Rental Agreements will not be materially above the range indicated above or that we will not be subject to additional claims as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy filing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had $853.8 million and $877.2 million, respectively, of net deferred tax liabilities. We provide for deferred income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. In 1997 and 1999, we engaged in certain transactions that are of a type that the Internal Revenue Service has indicated it intends to challenge. Approximately $680 million of the net deferred tax liabilities relate to these transactions, including a significant portion that relates to a transaction that generally had the effect of accelerating certain future deductions. The amount of foregone tax deductions in 2001 relating to that transaction was approximately $44 million. These transactions are currently under review by the Internal Revenue Service. We believe that our tax returns appropriately reflect such transactions, and that we have established adequate reserves with respect to any tax liabilities relating to these transactions. However, an unfavorable settlement or adverse resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 34 CASH FLOWS Changes in floorplan notes payable, which previously were classified as financing activities, have been reclassified to operating activities in the accompanying Statements of Cash Flows to provide a more meaningful representation of our operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $43.5 million, $(153.6) million and $(489.9) million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by operating activities was $540.1 million, $431.4 million and $478.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in floorplan notes payable which directly relate to vehicle inventory. The 2001 change in inventory, net of floorplan notes payable, is attributable to lower inventory levels maintained in 2001 as compared to 2000. The 2001 change in other liabilities is the result of megastore and other exit payments made in 2000 as part of 1999 restructuring activities. CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash provided by (used for) capital additions, property dispositions, net activity of installment loan receivables, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below and business acquisitions and divestitures. Capital expenditures were $163.6 million, $138.7 million and $242.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to amounts expended on store renovations and technology upgrades. Approximately half of our capital investments during 2001 related to required improvements of our existing dealership facilities. The balance of our capital investments during 2001 related to upgrades to existing dealership facilities and construction of new facilities that we generally target to generate rates of return consistent with our investment goal of a 15% after tax rate of return. We will make additional facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect capital expenditures in 2002 to be approximately $150 million. The 2000 decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to fewer acquisitions, and the closures of the megastores, which had driven capital expenditures higher in 1999. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and assets held for sale were $98.3 million, $129.9 million and $88.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastore and other properties held for sale. The 2000 amount also includes proceeds from the sale of the building occupied by ANC Rental. Funding of installment loan receivables, net of collections, totaled $474.9 million, $562.3 million and $1.6 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. Related proceeds from securitization of installment loan contracts were $557.2 million, $720.3 million and $1.6 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. As discussed under the heading "Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities", the Company exited the auto loan underwriting business in December 2001. During 2001, we moved various invested restricted cash deposits related to certain insurance programs to a series of restricted investments. See Note 4, Restricted Assets and Reinsurance, of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash used in business acquisitions was $92.0 million, $313.3 million and $914.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions is primarily due to a planned reduction in acquisition activity including our shift in 2000 to acquire single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in key existing markets. Cash used in business acquisitions 35 during 2001, 2000 and 1999 includes $22.3 million, $122.4 million and $34.9 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion under the heading "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures" and in Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash received from business divestitures was $61.2 million, $178.7 million and $131.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 cash received primarily represents the net proceeds from the sale of the Flemington dealer group as further discussed under the heading, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures" and in Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 1998, our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, completed an initial public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. In May 1999, we sold substantially all of our interest in Republic Services in a public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. Proceeds from the offerings were used to repay non vehicle debt, finance acquisitions, acquire shares under our share repurchase programs and invest in our business. During 2000, we sold substantially all of our remaining common stock of Republic Services, resulting in proceeds of approximately $48.2 million. CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash flows from financing activities include revolving credit financings and payments, proceeds from senior unsecured notes issued, repayments of acquired debt, treasury stock purchases and other transactions as further described below. During 2001, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $434.7 million. Additionally, during 2001 we received proceeds of $153.3 million relating to new mortgage facilities. See further discussion under the heading "Financial Condition" and in Note 8, Notes Payable and Long term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts were used to repay outstanding amounts under revolving credit facilities totaling $615.0 million and certain other debt. We have repurchased approximately 27.3 million, 27.6 million and 91.0 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, for an aggregate price of $256.8 million, $188.9 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchase programs. During 2000, we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving our corporate headquarters, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $52.1 million. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we repaid approximately $178.3 million and $197.0 million, respectively, of debt obligations primarily related to amounts financed under a $210.0 million lease facility (amended September 2000 from the original capacity of $500.0 million). See Note 8, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We will continue to evaluate the best use of our operating cash flow between capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reduction. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the credit agreements for our two revolving credit facilities restrict our ability to declare cash dividends. 36 CASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Cash used in discontinued operations was as follows during the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Automotive rental........................................... $ $(227.0) $(160.3) Solid waste services........................................ (546.0) $ $(227.0) $(706.3) Cash used in our former automotive rental business during 2000 consists primarily of cash used to replace maturing letters of credit which provide credit enhancement for ANC Rentals vehicle financing. LIQUIDITY We require cash to fund working capital needs, finance acquisitions of new dealerships and fund capital expenditures. These requirements are met principally from cash flows from operations, borrowings under floor plan financings, mortgage notes and credit facilities. We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floorplan facilities, our revolving credit facilities and our mortgage facilities will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements, commitments and contingencies and any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to finance capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and share repurchases through cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and other financings. CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2001 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD AFTER TOTAL 1 YEAR 2 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS 5 YEARS Floorplan notes payable (Note 3)................... $1,900.7 $1,900.7 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 8).......... 655.2 7.9 18.2 51.2 577.9 Operating lease commitments (Note 9)............... 458.6 76.1 121.4 87.7 173.4 Acquisition purchase price commitments (Note 18)... 140.8 140.8 Total..................................... $3,155.3 $2,125.5 $139.6 $138.9 $751.3 In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2001, surety bonds and letters of credit totaled $39.8 million and have various expiration dates. As further discussed under the heading "Financial Condition", in connection with ANC Rentals spin off, we provide certain credit enhancements and guarantees with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental. The timing of when these obligations will be satisfied is difficult to estimate, although we believe it is likely that the majority will be satisfied in the next five years. SEASONALITY Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year in part due to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by other factors unrelated to season, such as automotive manufacturer incentives programs. Comparisons of our sales and operating results 37 between different quarters within a single year are, therefore, not necessarily indicators of our future performance. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On June 30, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") finalized Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). We have adopted the provisions of SFAS 141 which require all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method, eliminating the pooling of interests method. Additionally acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless of the acquirers intent to do so. SFAS 142, upon adoption, eliminates goodwill amortization over its estimated useful life. However, goodwill will be subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Intangible assets with definitive lives will need to be amortized over their useful lives. The provisions of SFAS 142 applied immediately to all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives existing at June 30, 2001 were amortized until December 31, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002 such amortization ceased, as companies were required to adopt the new rules on that date. By the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2002, we will, as required, begin to perform an impairment analysis of intangible assets. SFAS 142 requires us upon adoption and at least annually to reassess the intangible assets, including goodwill, previously recorded in connection with earlier purchase acquisitions, as well as their useful lives. Furthermore, we will, as required, complete the first step of the goodwill transition impairment test by June 30, 2002 which requires determining the fair value of the reporting unit, as defined by SFAS 142, and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit. If this fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further analysis is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets, we must perform step two of the SFAS 142 impairment test, which requires us to allocate the implied fair value of the reporting unit to all underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. Any impairment noted must be recorded at the date of adoption restating first quarter results, if necessary. Impairment charges, if any, that result from the application of the above test would be recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2002. We will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of SFAS 142 on our consolidated financial statements until such time as we apply its provisions. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 supercedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of" and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effect of the Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" ("APB 30"). SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired. SFAS 144 retains the provisions of APB 30 for the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and the interim periods within. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 144 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, 38 including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is cyclical and is sensitive to changing economic conditions and manufacturer incentive programs; we expect retail sales of new vehicles in the United States during 2002 to decrease by an estimated five to ten percent compared to 2001 on a unit basis although sales levels are very difficult to predict; lower actual sales levels could materially adversely impact our business. ANC Rental Corporation recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Accordingly, we have been called on to perform under certain guarantees with respect to ANC Rental, we may be called on to perform under additional credit enhancements and guarantees in the future, and we may have claims against ANC Rental that may be discharged in bankruptcy, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We have engaged in certain transactions that are under review by the IRS and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to residual value risk and consumer credit risk in connection with our lease portfolio, consumer credit risk in connection with our finance receivables and related assets and underwriting risk in connection with our reinsurance of warranty and protection products. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. Our dealerships are dependent on the programs and operations of vehicle manufacturers and, therefore, any changes to such programs and operations may adversely affect our dealership operations and, in turn, affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We are subject to restrictions imposed by vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire new dealerships. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if we are found to be in violation of any of these regulations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. We may encounter limitations on our ability to acquire automotive dealerships in key markets on favorable terms or at all, which may materially adversely affect our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. New accounting pronouncements on business combinations and goodwill will affect our future earnings. 39 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions. In 2001, we have chosen to present sensitivity information relating to our market risk, instead of the tabular information previously presented, in order to present more meaningful information. INTEREST RATE RISK At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had variable rate floorplan notes payable totaling $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2001 and 2000, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $18.8 million and $24.6 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense which is a component of cost of operations. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to floorplan notes payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance which is generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floorplan notes payable arrangements. Net of floorplan assistance, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $9.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $153.3 million and $790.8 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, change to interest expense. HEDGING RISK During 2001 and 2000, to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates we used interest rate derivatives related to the commercial paper warehouse facility which consisted of interest rate swaps, caps and floors which were entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. At December 31, 2001, we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding. As of December 31, 2000, we had entered into a series of interest rate caps and floors with a notional amount value of $576.3 million contractually maturing through 2006 at a fixed rate of 6.62% to manage the impact of interest rate changes on securitized installment loan receivables. Fair value at December 31, 2000 for the interest rate caps and floors were $(2.6) million and $14.3 million, respectively. As further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as of January 1, 2001, we adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. 40
