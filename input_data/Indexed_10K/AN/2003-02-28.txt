Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the Introduction, Business, Business Strategy, and Risk Factors sections of this Form 10 K and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Consolidated Results of Operations AutoNation, Inc. is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, we owned and operated 369 new vehicle franchises from 282 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our dealerships, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known dealerships in our key markets, sell 35 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 95% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2002, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing redundant operating expenses, improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across our dealerships. As further discussed in Note 25, Prior Year Reclassifications and Disaggregations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain amounts have been reclassified from the previously reported financial statements and disaggregations of certain disclosures have been made to conform with the financial statement presentation of the current period. The reclassifications include the presentation of floorplan interest expense below operating income. Floorplan interest expense was classified as a component of cost of operations in previously reported financial information, including in the unaudited income statements and financial information presented in our 2002 Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and our press release announcing our 2002 fourth quarter and full year results of operations on Thursday, February 6, 2003. The reclassification of floorplan interest expense had no impact to net income and earnings per share. The following is a summary of our Consolidated Income Statements both in gross dollars and on a diluted per share basis for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share data): 2002 2001 2000 Diluted Diluted Diluted Per Per Per Dollars Share Dollars Share Dollars Share Income from continuing operations $ 381.6 $ 1.19 $ 245.0 $ .73 $ 328.1 $ .91 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes: Automotive rental (12.7 ) (.04 ) 13.1 .03 Loss on disposal of segments (11.3 ) (.03 ) (12.7 ) (.04 ) 1.8 Net income, as reported $ 381.6 $ 1.19 $ 232.3 $ .69 $ 329.9 $ .91 19 Table of Contents The following factors have impacted our financial condition and results of operations and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results: Elimination of Goodwill Amortization: Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated goodwill amortization. See further discussion under the heading New Accounting Pronouncements. Share Repurchases: In October 2002, our Board of Directors extended our share repurchase program by authorizing us to acquire an additional $500.0 million of our common stock. Including the program authorized in October 2002, our Board has authorized us to acquire $2.5 billion of our common stock since 1998 and, through December 31, 2002, we have acquired 185.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.1 billion, leaving approximately $370.4 million authorized for repurchases at December 31, 2002. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. Exit from Auto Loan Underwriting Business: In 2001, we recorded an after tax charge of $52.3 million to reflect a write down of outstanding auto loans and related assets in our retail auto loan portfolio and to cover costs associated with our exit from the auto loan underwriting business. See further discussion under the heading Auto Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities. Non core Businesses: In 2001 and 2000, we recorded gains and losses in connection with the divestiture of our interests in certain non core businesses. These divestitures included: (1) the spin off of ANC Rental Corporation in June 2000 and the related after tax charge of $12.7 million incurred in 2001 as a result of assuming certain obligations, which has been included in discontinued operations; (2) the sale of the Flemington dealership group; (3) the divestiture of our former outdoor media business; and (4) the sale of our remaining interest of Republic Services, Inc., our former solid waste business. Investment Write down: In 2000, we recorded an after tax charge of $18.8 million to reflect a write down of an equity method investment in a privately held salvage and parts recycling business, as well as an after tax charge of $3.1 million to reflect a write down to fair value of another equity method investment, subsequently sold in early 2001 at no additional gain or loss. The following table provides a detailed reconciliation of how certain after tax charges and gains have impacted reported Net Income for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share data): 2002 2001 2000 Diluted Diluted Diluted Per Per Per Dollars Share Dollars Share Dollars Share Net income, as reported $ 381.6 $ 1.19 $ 232.3 $ .69 $ 329.9 $ .91 Certain charges and (gains) net of tax: Discontinued operations 12.7 .04 (1.8 ) Asset impairment and related charges loan underwriting business 52.3 .16 Loan and lease underwriting activity, net(1) (8.6 ) (.03 ) Gain on sale of Flemington dealership group (11.8 ) (.04 ) Gain on sale of outdoor media business (33.4 ) (.09 ) Goodwill amortization 59.8 .18 60.5 .17 Asset impairment minority equity investments 21.9 .06 Gain on sale of Republic Services stock (15.0 ) (.04 ) Other items, net(2) .9 5.3 .02 1.2 Net income, excluding certain charges and (gains) $ 373.9 $ 1.16 $ 350.6 $ 1.05 $ 363.3 $ 1.01 (1) Loan and lease underwriting activity, net, consists of 2002 activity for the finance underwriting business exited in December 2001. 20 Table of Contents (2) Other items, net, consist of restructuring and related impairment charges and write downs of finance lease receivable residual values. Net Income, Excluding Certain Charges and Gains above is presented on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The above information is presented for informational purposes only and may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible Assets Our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible assets, which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. We have adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, which requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method, eliminating the pooling of interests method. Additionally, acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of the acquirers intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. These franchise agreements have indefinite lives. Effective January 1, 2002, we also adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with identified lives existing at June 30, 2001 were amortized primarily over forty years on a straight line basis until December 31, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, such amortization ceased. Other intangibles with definite lives continue to be amortized primarily over three to fifteen years. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business. Self Insurance Under self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses, as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty and employee medical benefits. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim are insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by actuarial evaluation based on historical claim settlement experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims handling procedures. While we believe our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated liability for these reserves could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions. See further discussion in Note 8, Insurance, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies As further discussed in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we are involved, and will continue to be involved, in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with customers, employment related lawsuits, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves and assert available defenses with respect to each of these matters. Where necessary, we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these proceedings based on consultation with outside counsel, assuming various strategies. Further, we may have certain 21 Table of Contents insurance coverage and rights of indemnification with respect to certain aspects of these matters. However, a settlement or an adverse resolution of one or more of these matters may result in the payment of significant costs and damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In June 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of our former automotive rental business, ANC Rental. ANC Rental declared bankruptcy in November 2001. We were called on to perform under certain of our credit enhancements and guarantees in 2001 and may be subject to future exposure related to these credit enhancements, guarantees or additional claims. See further discussion under the heading Discontinued Business Segments. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles, including any commissions from related vehicle financings. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered. Rebates and holdbacks received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Revenue on finance products represents commissions earned by us for loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and is recognized upon acceptance of customer credit by the financial institution. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized. We may also participate in future underwriting profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Through 2002, we reinsured some or all of the underwriting risk related to extended warranty and credit insurance products sold and administered by certain independent third parties through our captive insurance subsidiaries. Revenue and related direct costs from these reinsurance transactions were deferred and are recognized over the life of the policies. Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer reinsure any new extended warranty and credit insurance products. In the future, should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria have not been met, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected. Finance and Lease Underwriting In December 2001, we decided that we would no longer underwrite retail auto loans for customers at our dealerships and incurred a pre tax charge in 2001 of $85.8 million to reflect a write down of our outstanding auto loans and related assets in our portfolio and to cover costs associated with our exit from that business. We continue to manage and wind down our outstanding loan and lease portfolios and related assets. Accordingly, we remain subject to consumer credit risk in connection with our portfolio of installment receivables, our lease portfolio and other related assets. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that based on certain estimates and assumptions used, our portfolio of installment receivables, our lease portfolio and other related assets could be overvalued and require additional write down. See further discussion in Note 13, Finance Underwriting and Asset Securitizations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). In 1997 and 1999, we engaged in certain transactions that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is challenging. Approximately $670 million of the net deferred tax liabilities relate to these transactions. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. 22 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data: Our historical operating results include the results of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition.

Years Ended December 31, Variance Variance 2002 2001 2002 vs. 2001 2000 2001 vs. 2000 Floorplan assistance $ 127.9 $ 140.8 $ (12.9 ) $ 194.0 $ (53.2 ) Floorplan interest expense (74.8 ) (126.7 ) 51.9 (198.6 ) 71.9 Net inventory carrying (cost) benefit $ 53.1 $ 14.1 $ 39.0 $ (4.6 ) $ 18.7 Total revenue was $19.5 billion, $20.0 billion and $20.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit was $3.0 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The primary components of these changes are described below. New vehicle revenue decreased 2.5% to $11.7 billion in 2002 compared to 2001 due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. On a same store basis, new vehicle revenue decreased 4.6% in 2002 compared to 2001 due to a decrease in volume of 7.1% partially offset by a 2.5% increase in average revenue per unit. Although we have continued to benefit from high levels of consumer incentive programs from the manufacturers introduced during the fourth quarter of 2001, we experienced a decrease in volume in 2002 consistent with industry declines of retail unit sales. We expect industry wide new vehicles sales in the United States during 2003 to decrease by an estimated three to five percent compared to 24 Table of Contents 2002 on a unit basis. However, the level of retail sales for 2003 is very difficult to predict. We have experienced lower than expected vehicle sales to date during 2003, which we attribute in part to the impact of the prospects of war on consumer demand for vehicles. Continued uncertainty regarding the prospects of war or a prolonged war could materially adversely impact our vehicle sales and overall business. In 2001, new vehicle sales were affected by lower demand experienced in the domestic product lines. The introduction of significant manufacturer incentives greatly increased the pace of new vehicle sales during the final three months of 2001. Reported new vehicle gross profit decreased 5.7% in 2002 to $909.9 million, primarily the result of a decrease in same store gross profit partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. On a same store basis, new vehicle gross profit decreased 8.2%, in large part due to volume decreases as well as slight margin compression. New vehicle days supply was 79 days at December 31, 2002 up 18 days from December 31, 2001. We believe that the 2002 level is appropriately balanced as we enter the 2003 selling season. We manage our inventory to minimize inventory carrying costs (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers), which decreased $39 million in 2002 versus 2001, primarily as the result of lower interest rates. While interest rates are at an all time low, we expect modest increases in floorplan interest rates in 2003. We believe the effect of the increases will be partially offset by increases in floorplan interest assistance from the vehicle manufacturers, which is also interest rate sensitive, although we do not expect to realize the same level of benefit from net inventory carrying costs as we did during 2002. Net inventory carrying costs decreased $18.7 million in 2001 versus 2000 due to inventory management activities and lower interest rates. Used vehicle revenue decreased 2.5% to $3.8 billion in 2002 compared to 2001 due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. On a same store basis, used vehicle revenue decreased 4.8% in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in volume of 5.4%, which was in large part caused by continued strong manufacturer incentives and zero percent financing for new vehicles as well as a more restrictive financing environment for used vehicles. Reported used vehicle gross profit decreased 5.5% to $403.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Same store used vehicle gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 30 basis points to 10.7% compared to 2001 due to pricing pressures resulting from manufacturer new vehicle incentives and an oversupply of used vehicles in the marketplace. Consistent with decreases in new vehicle sales, we have experienced lower than expected used vehicle sales to date during 2003. In 2001, used vehicle revenue on a reported basis was relatively flat compared to 2000. Gross profit in 2001 decreased compared to 2000 due to an uncertain wholesale market, which resulted in our decision to retail used vehicle inventory whenever possible as part of our inventory management practices. Parts and service revenue increased 2.0% to $2.5 billion in 2002 compared to 2001 driven by the impact of acquisitions. On a reported basis, parts and service gross profit increased 2.8% to $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of higher revenue coupled with margin expansion of 30 basis points to 43.5%. Revenue and gross profit remained relatively flat in 2002 compared to 2001 on a same store basis. Revenue was impacted by reduced warranty volume from domestic manufacturers, a soft collision repair market and comparisons to 2001, which included a large manufacturer recall. As a percentage of same store revenue, parts and service same store gross profit increased 20 basis points to 43.4% as a result of our continued implementation of a pricing strategy, a team based service process and a comprehensive marketing plan. Parts and service revenue and gross profit increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily driven by parts and service initiatives. Despite a 2.5% decrease in vehicle sales during 2002, finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased 4.2% to $510.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001. On a same store basis, finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased 2.4%. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased 13.4% to $489.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed increased 10.2% in 2002 to $757 compared to $687 in 2001. Increases are primarily due to increased product penetration as a result of our continued standardization of product pricing and our menu based finance and insurance sales process, which facilitates sales particularly in a low interest rate environment. Other revenue, primarily consisting of wholesale revenue from the sale of used vehicles, decreased 14.7% to $1.0 billion in 2002 compared to 2001. This revenue decrease primarily reflects a reduction in the number of 25 Table of Contents units wholesaled due to an overall decline in new and used vehicle sales. Other gross profit, which includes the results of reinsurance and retrospective basis commissions on extended warranty contracts, fees from preferred lender arrangements, and wholesale and fleet operations, increased $14.4 million or 17.8% to $95.1 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was driven by income realized due to claims experience improvements on our extended warranty portfolio as well as higher fees from preferred lender financing arrangements, which may not be indicative of future performance. In 2001, other revenue decreased 18.3% compared to 2000 due to a reduction in the number of units wholesaled. Other gross profit decreased 15.8% in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of a reduction in wholesale and fleet revenue. In 2002, we focused on cost management initiatives in the areas of compensation, advertising and general and administrative expenses. Store selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in 2002 compared to 2001. On a same store basis, store selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.1% or $42.7 million. The decrease in store selling, general and administrative expenses during 2002 was driven by decreased compensation expenses in part due to staffing reductions partially offset by slightly higher advertising and other miscellaneous expenses. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily due to increased advertising and other miscellaneous expenses. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses were $141.1 million, $135.2 million and $156.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2002 is primarily the result of investments in strategic initiatives and related infrastructure. The 2001 decrease is primarily the result of the continued disposal of excess properties. As a percentage of gross profit, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses were 4.7%, 4.5% and 5.2% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to total approximately $150 million to $155 million in 2003. We will continue our focus on cost management in 2003, although we expect increased insurance, strategic initiative and employee medical benefit costs, which would have the effect of offsetting some of the expected cost savings at both the store and corporate levels. Depreciation was $67.3 million, $70.7 million and $54.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2001 increase was primarily the result of capital expenditures. Due to higher capital expenditure levels in 2002, depreciation in 2003 is expected to total approximately $75 million to $80 million. Amortization was $2.4 million, $81.2 million and $79.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in 2002 is due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of new goodwill accounting rules effective January 1, 2002. See further discussion under the heading New Accounting Pronouncements. Loan and lease underwriting losses (income) were $(13.9) million, $89.6 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See discussion under heading Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities. Restructuring and related impairment charges (recoveries), net were $1.4 million, $4.5 million and $(20.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, additional impairment charges totaling $4.2 million were recorded based on the re evaluation of the fair value of certain properties held for sale which were part of the restructuring plan, partially offset by a net gain on the sale of a property of $2.8 million. The net charge in 2001 is primarily the result of an additional impairment charge based on the re evaluation of the fair value of certain properties. In 2000 the net recovery is primarily due to a net gain on properties placed back in service or retained totaling $36.2 million offset by an additional impairment charge of $11.6 million recognized primarily as a result of a decision in 2000 to close an additional megastore property as part of the restructuring. See discussion under heading Restructuring Activities. Other losses of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were primarily the result of a property write down partially offset by a gain on the transfer of reinsurance agreements as further discussed under the heading Financial Condition. Other gains in 2001 of $19.3 million primarily consists of the pre tax gain from the sale of the New Jersey based Flemington dealership group. 26 Table of Contents Same Store Operating Data: We have presented below our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 on a same store basis to reflect our internal performance. Same store operating results include the results of stores for identical months in both years included in the comparison, starting with the first month of our ownership or operation. The following table sets forth: (1) the components of same store revenue; (2) the components of same store gross profit; (3) same store selling, general and administrative expenses; (4) retail vehicle same store unit sales; (5) gross profit per vehicle retailed; and (6) related metrics: Years Ended December 31, Variance Favorable/ 2002 2001 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle and % data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 11,327.2 $ 11,873.7 $ (546.5 ) (4.6 ) Used vehicle 3,652.1 3,837.3 (185.2 ) (4.8 ) Parts and service 2,364.9 2,363.4 1.5 .1 Finance and insurance, net 496.7 485.0 11.7 2.4 Other 955.5 1,172.4 (216.9 ) (18.5 ) Total revenue $ 18,796.4 $ 19,731.8 $ (935.4 ) (4.7 ) Gross profit: New vehicle $ 877.1 $ 955.2 $ (78.1 ) (8.2 ) Used vehicle 391.5 422.4 (30.9 ) (7.3 ) Parts and service 1,027.2 1,021.0 6.2 .6 Finance and insurance 496.7 485.0 11.7 2.4 Other 75.0 70.0 5.0 7.1 Total gross profit $ 2,867.5 $ 2,953.6 $ (86.1 ) (2.9 ) S, G&A Store $ 1,983.2 $ 2,025.9 $ 42.7 2.1 Retail vehicle unit sales: New 416,917 448,984 (32,067 ) (7.1 ) Used 241,453 255,329 (13,876 ) (5.4 ) 658,370 704,313 (45,943 ) (6.5 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,104 $ 2,127 $ (23 ) (1.1 ) Used vehicle $ 1,621 $ 1,654 $ (33 ) (2.0 ) Finance and insurance $ 754 $ 689 $ 65 9.4 Years Ended December 31, % 2002 % 2001 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 60.3 60.2 Used vehicle 19.4 19.4 Parts and service 12.6 12.0 Finance and insurance 2.6 2.5 Other 5.1 5.9 Total 100.0 100.0 27 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2002 % 2001 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.7 8.0 Used vehicle 10.7 11.0 Parts and service 43.4 43.2 Finance and insurance 100.0 100.0 Other 7.8 6.0 Total 15.3 15.0 In 2002, we focused on operational improvements in the high profit areas of our business parts and service and finance and insurance. Although these areas collectively comprise 15.2% of total same store revenue, they contributed 53.1% of total same store gross profit in 2002. We also benefited from our focus on cost management initiatives, resulting in a decrease to same store selling, general and administrative expenses of $42.7 million or 2.1% compared to 2001. Discontinued Business Segments On June 30, 2000, we completed the spin off of our former automotive rental businesses, which were organized under ANC Rental Corporation together with its subsidiaries (ANC Rental), by distributing 100% of ANC Rentals common stock to AutoNations stockholders as a tax free dividend. As a result of the spin off, AutoNation stockholders received one share of ANC Rental common stock for every eight shares of AutoNation common stock owned as of the June 16, 2000 record date. As discussed in Note 17, Discontinued Operations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, ANC Rental has been accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accordingly, the operating results of ANC Rental have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the spin off of ANC Rental Corporation in June 2000, we agreed to provide certain guarantees and credit enhancements with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental, including acting as a guarantor under certain motor vehicle and real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, Inc. (Mitsubishi) and acting as an indemnitor with respect to certain surety bonds issued on ANC Rentals behalf. We are also a party to certain agreements with ANC Rental (the ANC Rental Agreements), including a separation and distribution agreement, a reimbursement agreement and a tax sharing agreement, pursuant to which both ANC Rental and we have certain obligations. On November 13, 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. In connection with ANC Rentals bankruptcy, we were called on to perform under nine of the twelve real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi for which we provided guarantees. As a result, we agreed to assume these real property leases, which expire in 2017, in order to control and attempt to mitigate our exposure relating thereto. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million included in net income from discontinued operations to reflect our assumption of the nine leases with Mitsubishi and certain other costs that we expect to incur as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy. We continue to guarantee the remaining three leases with Mitsubishi until their expiration in 2017, and we expect to be called on to perform under at least two of these leases during 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we have accrued liabilities of approximately $11 million that we believe are adequate to cover our probable exposures related to these leases. ANC Rental has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and, accordingly, we expect that additional charges recorded by us pursuant to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees or with respect to claims under the ANC Rental Agreements, if any, would not impact our reported results from continuing operations. We reached an agreement with Mitsubishi in early 2002 pursuant to which our aggregate financial exposure relating to motor vehicles leased by ANC Rental from Mitsubishi is capped at $10.0 million. Based on ANC Rentals continued performance under the motor vehicle lease agreement, we believe our financial 28 Table of Contents exposure under the agreement will be minimal. Our indemnification obligations with respect to the surety bonds issued on behalf of ANC Rental are capped at $29.5 million in the aggregate. We could have potential exposure under the indemnification obligations until approximately 2006. Due to the bankruptcy of ANC Rental, obligations of ANC Rental to us under the terms of the ANC Rental Agreements may be extinguished or our claims against ANC Rental under such agreements may be unenforceable. These claims could include reimbursement obligations that ANC Rental may have to us in connection with payments made by us with respect to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees, as well as indemnification rights with respect to any payments that we make to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of audit adjustments in our consolidated federal income tax returns relating to ANC Rentals automotive rental businesses prior to the spin off. Such audit adjustments, if any, would likely be resolved in the next two to four years. We estimate that, based on our assessment of the risks involved in each matter and excluding the liabilities associated with the property leases discussed above, our remaining potential exposure related to ANC Rental may be in the range of $25.0 million to $50.0 million. However, the exposure is difficult to estimate and we cannot assure you that our aggregate obligations under these credit enhancements, guarantees and ANC Rental Agreements will not be materially above the range indicated above, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We have filed various claims against ANC Rental in the bankruptcy, including claims related to these credit enhancements, guarantees and ANC Rental Agreements. These claims may be discharged, in whole or in part, in the bankruptcy. The Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy is presently investigating potential claims against us in connection with our prior ownership and spin off of ANC Rental, including claims that ANC Rental was undercapitalized at the time of the spin off. There can be no assurances that we will not be subject to these or other additional claims as a result of ANC Rentals bankruptcy filing. If any such potential claims were to be brought against us, we would vigorously defend ourselves and assert available defenses. However, there can be no assurances that we would prevail in any such claims, or that a failure to prevail would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. In July 1998, our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, Inc., completed an initial public offering of 36.1% of its common stock. In May 1999, we sold substantially all of our interest in Republic Services in a public offering. Our remaining interest was sold in 2000. Business Acquisitions and Divestitures During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we acquired various automotive retail businesses. We paid approximately $158.4 million, $69.7 million and $190.9 million, respectively, in cash for these acquisitions, all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We also paid $8.1 million, $22.3 million and $122.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $9.7 million of deferred purchase price due to former owners of acquired businesses had been accrued. In April 2001, we completed the sale of our New Jersey based Flemington dealership group for net proceeds of $59.0 million and a pre tax gain of approximately $19.0 million. In November 2000, we completed the divestiture of our outdoor media business for a purchase price of approximately $104.0 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a prepaid $15.0 million advertising agreement and, therefore, we received net proceeds of $89.0 million. A pre tax gain of $53.5 million was recognized on the sale. See Note 19, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of business combinations. Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our dealerships, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. We continue to 29 Table of Contents provide automobile loans for our customers through unrelated third party financing sources, which historically had provided more than 95% of the auto loans made to our customers. The decision to exit the loan underwriting business and the impact of the economic conditions referenced above caused us to incur asset impairment and related charges totaling $85.8 million recorded in December 2001. These charges mainly reflect the impact of expected increases in loan losses and prepayments, as well as higher expected loan servicing costs. The charges also include $1.5 million of direct exit costs for asset write offs and other costs. In addition, during 2001 and 2000, we recognized impairment charges totaling $4.1 million and $16.6 million, respectively, primarily associated with the deterioration in residual values of finance lease receivables. We discontinued the writing of finance leases in mid 1999. Loan and lease underwriting income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The income in 2002 is the result of our continued focus on the management of our finance receivables and improved collections as part of our exit from the business of underwriting retail automobile loans. At December 31, 2002, we had finance receivables totaling $92.9 million which are expected to be substantially collected through 2004. See discussion of key economic assumptions and other information in Note 13, Finance Underwriting and Asset Securitizations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring Activities During 1999, we approved a restructuring plan to exit the used vehicle megastore business and reduce the corporate workforce. Approximately 2,000 positions were eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan of which 1,800 were megastore positions and 200 were corporate positions. These restructuring activities resulted in pre tax charges of $443.7 million in 1999. The restructuring plan also included divesting of certain non core franchised dealerships. During 2001 and 2000, we received $2.2 million and $89.7 million, respectively, of cash from the divestiture of certain automotive dealerships as part of our 1999 restructuring activities. We continue to dispose of our closed megastores and other properties, including closed lease properties, through sales to third parties. At December 31, 2002, properties held for sale, net totaled $59.9 million, including properties with total asset value of $49.8 million remaining to be sold of the total $285.3 million identified as part of the restructuring plan. Despite a softening market, these properties continue to be aggressively marketed. See further discussion in Note 14, Restructuring Activities and Impairment Charges, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non Operating Income (Expense) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $74.8 million, $126.7 million and $198.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Decreases are primarily related to lower interest rates in 2002 and 2001. While interest rates are at an all time low, we expect modest increases in floorplan interest rates in 2003. We believe the effect of the increases will be partially offset by increases in floorplan interest assistance from the vehicle manufacturers, which is also interest rate sensitive, although we do not expect to realize the same level of benefit from net inventory carrying costs as we did during 2002. Subsequent to year end, we entered into a series of interest rate hedge transactions designed to mitigate our exposure to certain floating interest rate liabilities. As of February 26, 2003, we have executed $500.0 million of notional value hedges which mature over the next three years. Other Interest Expense During 2002, other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our mortgage facilities and the outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $50.4 million, $43.7 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 was 30 Table of Contents primarily due to higher fixed interest expenses related to the senior unsecured notes sold in August 2001. The decrease in 2001 was due to lower average borrowings as well as lower floating interest rates partially offset by additional fixed interest expense related to the senior unsecured notes. Interest Income Interest income was $10.4 million, $9.0 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 increase is primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates. We expect interest income in 2003 to decrease compared to 2002 due to the sale of our restricted investments in 2002. Other Income (Expense), Net For the year ended December 31, 2002, other income, net was $6.4 million. As discussed under the heading Financial Condition, in September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. As a result of the transaction, we liquidated related restricted assets, realizing a $3.1 million gain on the sale. Additionally, in 2002, we converted our remaining restricted investments to restricted cash, realizing a $2.7 million gain on the sale. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $4.5 million. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $33.4 million, and primarily included gains of approximately $24.0 million on the sale of approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock of our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, and approximately $53.5 million on the sale of our former outdoor media business, offset by a $30.0 million valuation write down related to an equity method investment in a privately held vehicle salvage and parts recycling business as well as a $5.0 million write down to fair value of another equity method investment, subsequently sold in early 2001 at no additional gain or loss. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $236.4 million, $155.8 million and $196.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 38.3%, 38.9% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 primarily reflects the impact of the elimination of goodwill amortization, partially offset by increases to our effective state tax rates. As further discussed under the heading Financial Condition, we have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions. Excluding the impact of any settlement with IRS, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be approximately 38.5% in 2003, an increase from the 2002 rate due to increases to our effective state tax rates. Financial Condition At December 31, 2002, we had $176.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We have two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. The 364 day revolving credit facility provides borrowings up to $200.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate and was renewed in August 2002 for another 364 day term to August 2003. The five year facility, which expires in August 2006, provides borrowings up to $300.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate. These facilities are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, which directly or indirectly own substantially all of our dealerships, and are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. No amounts are drawn on these revolving credit facilities. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2002, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $62.2 million and have various expiration dates. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our 31 Table of Contents multi year revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the $300 million multi year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2002, we had $21.8 million in letters of credit outstanding. Due to changes in insurance requirements, letters of credit outstanding are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million in 2003. We also have $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases), and investments, and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The revolving credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of consolidated maximum cash flow leverage, minimum interest coverage, and maximum balance sheet leverage. Over the life of the revolving credit facilities, certain of the financial covenants become more restrictive as prescribed by a predetermined schedule. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage incurrence covenant, and the mortgage facilities contain both maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage covenants. In the event that we were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facilities or mortgage facilities and such default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should we be in violation of the financial covenants, we could be limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. Our revolving credit facilities, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the mortgage facilities have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of ours. At December 31, 2002, we were in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants and do not anticipate any events of default. In conjunction with the revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes offering, we received corporate credit ratings from rating agencies. The revolving credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes have provisions linked to credit ratings. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are impacted by changes in credit ratings, and certain covenants related to the senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with certain upgrades in ratings to investment grade. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants would be impacted and we would continue to have access to the revolving credit facilities, but at higher rates of interest. At December 31, 2002, we had an aggregate $153.2 million outstanding under two mortgage facilities with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Each facility has an aggregate capacity of $150.0 million, bears interest at a LIBOR based interest rate, and is secured by mortgages on certain of our dealerships real property. We finance our new vehicle inventory through secured financings, primarily floorplan facilities, with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries as well as independent financial institutions. As of December 31, 2002, aggregate capacity of the facilities was approximately $3.6 billion. We finance our used vehicle inventory primarily through our cash flow from operations. We sell and receive commissions on the following types of vehicle protection and other products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection, credit insurance, lease wear and tear insurance, and theft protection products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements with these third party finance and vehicle protection product providers, we either sell the products on a straight commission basis or sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Through 2002, we assumed some of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer reinsure any new extended warranties and credit insurance products. We maintain restricted cash in 32 Table of Contents trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our captive insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002, we had restricted assets in excess of requirements totaling approximately $8 million. We closely monitor excess amounts and periodically obtain authorization to transfer excess amounts to unrestricted accounts, if necessary. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company, resulting in an $8.1 million gain. As a result of the transaction, we reduced our insurance reserves and liquidated related restricted assets, realizing a $3.1 million gain on the sale. We transferred $66.6 million of restricted assets to the third party insurance company in exchange for the assumption of the related insurance reserves. During 2002, we repurchased 30.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $389.9 million. In October 2002, our Board of Directors extended our share repurchase program by authorizing us to acquire an additional $500.0 million of our common stock. Including the program authorized in October 2002, our Board has authorized us to acquire $2.5 billion of our common stock since 1998 and, through December 31, 2002, we have acquired 185.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.1 billion, leaving approximately $370.4 million authorized for repurchases at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, we obtained consents from the holders of our $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008 to amend the indenture governing such notes (the Indenture), and we obtained consents from the lenders to amend our revolving credit facilities. The principal purpose of the amendments was to modify the restricted payments covenant under the Indenture and the revolving credit facilities to increase our share repurchase capacity by $400 million. As of February 26, 2003, we repurchased an additional 8.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $108.8 million, leaving approximately $261.6 million authorized by our Board for share repurchases. We expect to continue repurchasing shares under this program. Repurchases are made pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock, the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of our capital such as strategic dealership acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses. Our future share repurchases are also subject to limitations, as modified, contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes and our credit agreements for our two senior secured revolving credit facilities. In connection with the spin off of ANC Rental in June 2000, we agreed to provide certain guarantees and credit enhancements with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental, including acting as a guarantor under certain motor vehicle and real property leases between ANC Rental and Mitsubishi and acting as an indemnitor with respect to certain surety bonds issued on ANC Rentals behalf. We are also a party to ANC Rental Agreements, including a separation and distribution agreement, a reimbursement agreement and a tax sharing agreement, pursuant to which both ANC Rental and we have certain obligations. See further discussion under the heading Discontinued Business Segments. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, we had $891.2 million and $853.8 million, respectively, of net deferred tax liabilities. In 1997 and 1999, we engaged in certain transactions with tax implications that the Internal Revenue Service is challenging. Approximately $670 million of the net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2002 relates to these transactions, including a significant portion that relates to a transaction that generally had the effect of accelerating projected tax deductions relating to health and welfare benefits to which we would have been entitled upon providing such benefits in the future, and which deductions we are currently foregoing. In October 2002, the IRS announced a settlement initiative aimed at resolving IRS objections to these types of transactions. The settlement initiative includes settlement guidelines for companies that elect to enter into the settlement program offered by the IRS. Based on the settlement guidelines issued by the IRS, we estimate that, in connection with a possible settlement, we could owe the IRS net aggregate payments in the range of approximately $475 million to $550 million, a portion of which might be deferred over a multi year period. We estimate that the initial net payment in connection with such a settlement could be in the range of approximately $300 million to $400 million and would be payable in early 33 Table of Contents 2004, with the remaining amount deferred. We have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of these transactions since the fourth quarter of 2002. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that we will settle the tax treatment of the transactions with the IRS or, if we do, that such settlement will be on the terms outlined above, including with respect to the amount or timing of payments. A settlement or resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $48.1 million, $43.5 million and $(153.6) million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $542.5 million, $540.1 million and $431.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in floorplan notes payable which directly relate to new vehicle inventory. The 2001 change in inventory, net of floorplan notes payable, is attributable to lower inventory levels maintained in 2001 as compared to 2000. The 2001 change in other liabilities is the result of megastore and other exit payments made in 2000 as part of 1999 restructuring activities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions and divestitures, property dispositions, activity from installment loan receivables, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $163.4 million, $156.5 million and $138.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Property operating lease buy outs were $19.8 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We are in the process of analyzing certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluating alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Approximately half of our capital investments during 2002 related to required improvements of our existing dealership facilities. The balance of our capital investments during 2002 related to upgrades to existing dealership facilities and construction of new facilities that we generally target to generate rates of return consistent with our investment goal of a 15% after tax rate of return. We will make additional facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately $150 million. Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale were $34.8 million, $71.9 million and $75.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastore and other properties held for sale. The 2000 amount also includes proceeds from the sale of the building occupied by ANC Rental. Collections of installment loan receivables and other related items totaled $86.7 million, $551.5 million and $632.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There was no funding or proceeds from securitizations of installment loans receivables for the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of our decision to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans in December 2001, as discussed under the heading Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. We transferred $66.6 million of restricted assets to the third party insurance company in exchange for the assumption of the related insurance reserves. During 34 Table of Contents 2001, we moved various restricted cash deposits related to certain insurance programs to a series of restricted investments. See Note 4, Restricted Assets and Reinsurance, of Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $166.5 million, $92.0 million and $313.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in cash used in business acquisitions in 2002 was due to acquisitions of the Chicago based Laurel dealership group, Hudiburg Chevrolet in Fort Worth, Texas, and Claridges BMW in Fremont, California. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions in 2001 is primarily due to a planned reduction in acquisition activity including our shift in 2000 to acquire single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in key existing markets. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes $8.1 million, $22.3 million and $122.4 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion under the heading Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and in Note 19, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, we received $59.0 million of cash from the divestiture of our New Jersey based Flemington dealership group. As part of our restructuring activities, in 2001 and 2000 we divested of certain non core franchised automotive dealerships for which we received $2.2 million and $89.7 million, respectively, of cash. In 2000, we completed the divestiture of our outdoor media business for the net proceeds price of $89.0 million. See further discussion under the heading, Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and in Note 19, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 1998, our former solid waste subsidiary, Republic Services, completed an initial public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. In May 1999, we sold substantially all of our interest in Republic Services in a public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. Proceeds from the offerings were used to repay non vehicle debt, finance acquisitions, acquire shares under our share repurchase programs and invest in our business. During 2000, we sold substantially all of our remaining common stock of Republic Services, resulting in proceeds of approximately $48.2 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities include proceeds from senior unsecured notes issued, repayments of acquired debt, treasury stock purchases and other transactions as further described below. We have repurchased approximately 30.7 million, 27.3 million and 27.6 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for an aggregate price of $389.9 million, $256.8 million and $188.9 million, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchase programs. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $78.7 million, $9.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Increased activity in 2002 was due to higher market prices for our common stock, which resulted in more exercises of stock options outstanding. A substantial portion of stock option exercises during the first six months of 2002 were made by former employees who had retained stock options as part of the ANC Rental spin off on June 30, 2000. These options generally expired on June 30, 2002. During 2001, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $434.7 million. Additionally, during 2001 we received proceeds of $153.3 million relating to new mortgage facilities. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition and in Note 9, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts were used to repay outstanding amounts under revolving credit facilities totaling $615.0 million and certain other debt. Other cash used in financing activities totaled $11.8 million in 2002 and includes amounts paid in November 2002 related to consents obtained from the holders of our $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes to amend the indenture governing such notes and from the lenders to amend our revolving credit facilities. 35 Table of Contents During 2000, we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving our corporate headquarters, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $52.1 million. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we repaid approximately $178.3 million and $197.0 million, respectively, of debt obligations primarily related to amounts financed under a lease facility. See Note 9, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We will continue to evaluate the best use of our operating cash flow between capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reduction. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the credit agreements for our two revolving credit facilities restrict our ability to declare cash dividends. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations Cash used in discontinued operations was as follows during the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Automotive rental $ (8.4 ) $ $ (227.0 ) Cash used in 2002 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental. See further discussion under the heading Discontinued Business Segments. Cash used in our former automotive rental business during 2000 consists primarily of cash used to replace maturing letters of credit which provided credit enhancement for ANC Rentals vehicle financing. Liquidity We require cash to fund working capital needs, finance acquisitions of new dealerships, fund capital expenditures and common stock repurchases and for a potential settlement with the IRS as discussed under the heading Financial Condition. These requirements are met principally from cash flows from operations, borrowings under floorplan financings, mortgage notes and credit facilities. We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floorplan facilities, our revolving credit facilities and our mortgage facilities will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements, commitments and contingencies and any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to finance capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and share repurchases through cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and other financings. We do not foresee any difficulty in continuing to comply with the covenants of our various financing facilities. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our significant payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2002 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Floorplan notes payable (Note 3) $ 2,302.5 $ 2,302.5 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 9) 651.3 8.6 19.2 58.1 565.4 Operating lease commitments (Note 10) 425.9 75.9 107.4 83.9 158.7 Acquisition purchase price commitments (Note 19) 59.3 54.5 4.8 Total $ 3,439.0 $ 2,441.5 $ 131.4 $ 142.0 $ 724.1 In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2002, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $62.2 million and have various expiration dates. We do not currently 36 Table of Contents provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our multi year revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the $300 million multi year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2002, we had $21.8 million in letters of credit outstanding. Due to changes in insurance requirements, letters of credit outstanding are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million in 2003. We have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. As further discussed under the heading Discontinued Business Segments, in connection with ANC Rentals spin off, we provide certain credit enhancements and guarantees with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental. The timing of when these obligations will be satisfied is difficult to estimate, although we believe it is likely that the majority will be satisfied in the next five years. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by other factors unrelated to season, such as automotive manufacturer incentives programs. New Accounting Pronouncements In 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), which requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method, eliminating the pooling of interests method. Additionally, acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless of the acquirers intent to do so. Effective January 1, 2002, we also adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives existing at June 30, 2001 were amortized primarily over forty years on a straight line basis until December 31, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, such amortization ceased. Other intangibles with definite lives continue to be amortized primarily over three to fifteen years. See additional discussion in Note 6, Intangible Assets, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effect of the Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (APB 30). SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired. SFAS 144 retains the provisions of APB 30 for the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3. SFAS 146 requires that the 37 Table of Contents liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, not at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148). SFAS 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), to provide alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 as of December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires the recognition of a liability for certain guarantee obligations issued or modified after December 31, 2002. FIN 45 also clarifies disclosure requirements to be made by a guarantor for certain guarantees. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of APB No. 50 (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 will not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is cyclical and is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors; we expect industry wide sales of new vehicles in the United States during 2003 to decrease by an estimated three to five percent compared to 2002 on a unit basis, although sales levels may decrease by a greater amount due to various factors, including uncertainty relating 38 Table of Contents to the prospects of war. Sales levels are very difficult to predict; lower actual sales could materially adversely impact our business. We have engaged in certain transactions that the IRS has reviewed and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In connection with ANC Rental Corporations bankruptcy, we have been called on to perform under certain guarantees with respect to ANC Rental, we may be called on to perform under additional credit enhancements and guarantees in the future, we may have claims against ANC Rental that may be discharged in bankruptcy, and we may be subject to other claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We are subject to restrictions imposed by vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional dealerships. Our dealerships are dependent on the programs and operations of vehicle manufacturers and, therefore, any changes to such programs and operations may adversely affect our dealership operations and, in turn, affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if we are found to be in violation of any of these regulations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive dealerships in key markets on favorable terms or at all. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan notes payable, revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We are subject to residual value risk and consumer credit risk in connection with our lease portfolio, consumer credit risk in connection with our finance receivables and related assets and underwriting risk in connection with our reinsurance of warranty, credit life and protection products. Under SFAS 142, we must test our intangibles for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had variable rate floorplan notes payable totaling $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2002 and 2001, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $23.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to floorplan notes payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. Net of floorplan assistance, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, a 100 basis point change in interest 39 Table of Contents rates would result in an approximate $9.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively, change to our net inventory carrying costs. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $153.2 million and $153.4 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.5 million change to interest expense for both years. Subsequent to year end, we entered into a series of interest rate hedge transactions designed to mitigate our exposure to certain floating interest rate liabilities. As of February 26, 2003, we have executed $500.0 million of notional value hedges which mature over the next three years. Hedging Risk During 2001, to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates we used interest rate derivatives related to a commercial paper warehouse facility in connection with our financing underwriting business exited in 2001, which consisted of interest rate swaps, caps and floors which were entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding. 40 Table of Contents
