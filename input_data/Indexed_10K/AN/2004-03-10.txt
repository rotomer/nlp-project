Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. As further discussed in Note 24, Prior Year Reclassifications and Disaggregations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in an effort to improve reporting consistency within our automotive retailing peer group, certain amounts have been reclassified from the previously reported financial statements to conform with the income statement presentation of the current period. Finance and Insurance Revenue has been adjusted to include corporate volume incentives that were previously included in Other Revenue. Additionally, Used Vehicle Revenue and Cost of Sales have been adjusted to include the results of wholesale operations that were previously included in Other Revenue and Cost of Sales. There was no impact to total revenue or total gross profit as a result of these changes. 17 Table of Contents Overview AutoNation, Inc. is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, we owned and operated 367 new vehicle franchises from 283 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 35 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 98% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2003, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing operating expenses, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across all of our stores. The automotive retailing industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation characterized by periods of oversupply of new vehicles and weak consumer demand. We believe that many factors affect industry wide sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins, including, among other factors, consumer confidence in the economy, the level of manufacturers excess production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates and the level of personal discretionary spending. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had net income from continuing operations of $506.1 million and $381.6 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.76 and $1.19, respectively. Our results of operations in 2003 benefited from an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement (which resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of $127.5 million) and the leveraging of our cost structure. Additionally, our earnings per share benefited from our repurchase of outstanding shares. During 2003, we experienced a decrease in new vehicle volume due to lower consumer demand in certain markets in which we operate and for certain brands sold by us. We experienced downward pressure on our new vehicle gross profit margins during 2003, which we believe was largely due to manufacturers excess production capacity and intense competition in the industry. While we anticipate that the new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in 2004 and that manufacturers will look to reduce incentives offered to consumers, we expect that an improving economic environment will stabilize both new vehicle volumes and margins. However, the level of retail sales and gross profit for 2004 is very difficult to predict. Also, 2003 benefited from increased finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to increased product penetration and lower interest rates. Significantly higher interest rates in 2004 may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. The following factors have impacted our financial condition and results of operations in 2003 and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results: Income Taxes: In 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to certain transactions entered into in 1997 and 1999, whereby we agreed to make certain payments to the IRS through March 2007. As a result of the settlement, we recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. In July 2003, we made a $366 million prepayment of the initial amount due March 2004. Interest expense in 2003 related to the IRS settlement totaled $12.1 million. See further discussion under the heading Non operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Benefit from IRS Settlement. Additionally, in 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits totaling $13.4 million related to favorable adjustments and the resolution of various income tax matters. Share Repurchases: During 2003, we acquired 39.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $575.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, we have Board authoriza 18 Table of Contents tion for approximately $295.2 million of additional repurchases. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. Accounting for Manufacturer Allowances: As of January 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor. The adoption of EITF 02 16 resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change totaling $14.6 million after tax to reflect the deferral of certain allowances, primarily floorplan assistance, into inventory cost. See further discussion under the heading New Accounting Pronouncements. Real Estate Impairment: In 2003, we recognized a $27.5 million pre tax real estate impairment charge related to three underperforming franchised new vehicle stores that currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores. See further discussion under the heading Other Losses (Gains). Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible and Long Lived Assets Our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible and long lived assets, which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of the acquirers intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business. We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant and equipment and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing 19 Table of Contents has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized. We may also participate in future underwriting profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. In the future, should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria have not been met, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, used vehicles and parts inventory valuations reserves, reserves for self insurance programs, reserves for legal proceedings, and reserves for estimated tax liabilities. 20 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2003 2002 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2001 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 11,791.2 $ 11,694.8 $ 96.4 .8 $ 12,000.0 $ (305.2 ) (2.5 ) Used vehicle 4,492.3 4,709.8 (217.5 ) (4.6 ) 4,997.2 (287.4 ) (5.8 ) Parts and service 2,457.2 2,453.3 3.9 .2 2,404.9 48.4 2.0 Finance and insurance 601.1 563.7 37.4 6.6 528.9 34.8 6.6 Other 39.3 56.9 (17.6 ) 58.3 (1.4 ) Total revenue $ 19,381.1 $ 19,478.5 $ (97.4 ) (.5 ) $ 19,989.3 $ (510.8 ) (2.6 ) Gross profit: New vehicle $ 852.3 $ 909.9 $ (57.6 ) (6.3 ) $ 964.6 $ (54.7 ) (5.7 ) Used vehicle 403.1 394.7 8.4 2.1 418.0 (23.3 ) (5.6 ) Parts and service 1,072.2 1,068.3 3.9 .4 1,039.2 29.1 2.8 Finance and insurance 601.1 563.7 37.4 6.6 528.9 34.8 6.6 Other 34.1 49.9 (15.8 ) 49.9 Total gross profit 2,962.8 2,986.5 (23.7 ) (.8 ) 3,000.6 (14.1 ) (.5 ) Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,157.7 2,200.9 43.2 2.0 2,207.2 6.3 .3 Depreciation 69.4 67.3 (2.1 ) 70.7 3.4 Amortization 1.6 2.4 .8 81.2 78.8 Loan and lease underwriting losses (income), net (6.3 ) (13.9 ) (7.6 ) 89.6 103.5 Other losses (gains) 26.3 3.4 (22.9 ) (14.8 ) (18.2 ) Operating income 714.1 726.4 (12.3 ) (1.7 ) 566.7 159.7 28.2 Floorplan interest expense (71.4 ) (74.8 ) 3.4 4.5 (126.7 ) 51.9 41.0 Interest expense IRS settlement (12.1 ) (12.1 ) Other interest expense (59.7 ) (50.4 ) (9.3 ) (18.5 ) (43.7 ) (6.7 ) (15.3 ) Interest income 3.3 10.4 (7.1 ) (68.3 ) 9.0 1.4 15.6 Other income (expense), net 16.8 6.4 10.4 (4.5 ) 10.9 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 591.0 $ 618.0 $ (27.0 ) (4.4 ) $ 400.8 $ 217.2 54.2 Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 414,765 426,706 (11,941 ) (2.8 ) 453,857 (27,151 ) (6.0 ) Used vehicle 244,926 247,365 (2,439 ) (1.0 ) 258,523 (11,158 ) (4.3 ) 659,691 674,071 (14,380 ) (2.1 ) 712,380 (38,309 ) (5.4 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 28,429 $ 27,407 $ 1,022 3.7 $ 26,440 $ 967 3.7 Used vehicle $ 15,131 $ 15,308 $ (177 ) (1.2 ) $ 15,021 $ 287 1.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,055 $ 2,132 $ (77 ) (3.6 ) $ 2,125 $ 7 .3 Used vehicle $ 1,638 $ 1,629 $ 9 .6 $ 1,650 $ (21 ) (1.3 ) Finance and insurance $ 911 $ 836 $ 75 9.0 $ 742 $ 94 12.7 21 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2003 % 2002 % 2001 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 60.8 60.0 60.0 Used vehicle 23.2 24.2 25.0 Parts and service 12.7 12.6 12.0 Finance and insurance 3.1 2.9 2.6 Other .2 .3 .4 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.2 7.8 8.0 Used vehicle 10.8 10.6 11.0 Parts and service 43.6 43.5 43.2 Total 15.3 15.3 15.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.1 11.3 11.0 Operating income 3.7 3.7 2.8 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 72.8 73.7 73.6 Operating income 24.1 24.3 18.9 December 31, 2003 2002 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 71 days 63 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 41 days 40 days The following table details net inventory carrying costs consisting of floorplan assistance, a component of new vehicle gross profit, and floorplan interest expense.

The average increase in revenue per unit was attributable to a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles. The decrease in volume is primarily due to lower consumer demand in certain markets in which we operate and for certain brands sold by us. In 2002, although we continued to benefit from high levels of manufacturer consumer incentive programs introduced during the fourth quarter of 2001, we experienced volume decreases consistent with industry declines of retail unit sales. We experienced downward pressure on our new vehicle gross profit margins during 2003, which we believe was largely due to manufacturers excess production capacity and intense competition in the industry. While we anticipate that the new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in 2004 and that manufacturers will look to reduce incentives offered to consumers, we expect that an improving economic environment will stabilize both new vehicle volumes and margins. However, the level of retail sales and gross profit for 2004 is very difficult to predict. Gross profit in 2002 decreased compared to 2001 primarily due to same store sales declines partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Same store sales in 2002 decreased in large part due to volume decreases as well as slight margin compression. New vehicle days supply increased eight days compared to 2002 consistent with industry inventory levels. Inventory levels were impacted by a lower than expected sales pace during December 2003. The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) decreased in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily as a result of a decrease in floorplan assistance partially offset by a decrease in floorplan interest expense. The decrease in floorplan assistance was primarily due to lower vehicle sales and interest rates. The decrease in floorplan expense was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher inventory levels. In 2004, we expect the net inventory carrying benefit to decrease due to higher interest rates. 24 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ ($ in millions, 2003 2002 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2001 (Unfavorable) % Variance except per vehicle data) Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,706.0 $ 3,786.6 $ (80.6 ) (2.1 ) $ 3,883.2 $ (96.6 ) (2.5 ) Wholesale revenue 786.3 923.2 (136.9 ) (14.8 ) 1,114.0 (190.8 ) (17.1 ) Total revenue $ 4,492.3 $ 4,709.8 $ (217.5 ) (4.6 ) $ 4,997.2 $ (287.4 ) (5.8 ) Retail gross profit $ 401.1 $ 403.0 $ (1.9 ) (.5 ) $ 426.5 $ (23.5 ) (5.5 ) Wholesale gross profit 2.0 (8.3 ) 10.3 (8.5 ) .2 Total gross profit $ 403.1 $ 394.7 $ 8.4 2.1 $ 418.0 $ (23.3 ) (5.6 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 244,926 247,365 (2,439 ) (1.0 ) 258,523 (11,158 ) (4.3 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,131 $ 15,308 $ (177 ) (1.2 ) $ 15,021 $ 287 1.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,638 $ 1,629 $ 9 .6 $ 1,650 $ (21 ) (1.3 ) Days supply (trailing 30 days) 41 days 40 days Same Store: Revenue $ 4,357.5 $ 4,615.7 $ (258.2 ) (5.6 ) Gross profit $ 390.5 $ 387.1 $ 3.4 .9 Retail vehicle unit sales 239,750 242,288 (2,538 ) (1.0 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,136 $ 15,361 $ (225 ) (1.5 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,643 $ 1,641 $ 2 .1 Years Ended December 31, % 2003 % 2002 % 2001 Reported: Revenue mix percentage 23.2 24.2 25.0 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 10.8 10.6 11.0 Same Store: Revenue mix percentage 23.0 24.1 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 10.9 10.7 Used vehicle total revenue for 2003 decreased as a result of a decrease in wholesale revenue and lower used vehicle retail volume and revenue per vehicle retailed. Wholesale revenue decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of fewer trade ins due to decreased new vehicle volume and improved management of our used vehicle inventory. The revenue per vehicle retailed decrease reflects lower prices as a function of our shift in inventory to lower cost units, which is part of our used vehicle market strategy due to the highly competitive new vehicle market. The decrease in used vehicle revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily the result of a decrease in volume, which was in large part caused by continued strong manufacturer incentives and zero percent financing for new vehicles as well as a more restrictive financing environment for used vehicles. The decrease in used vehicle revenue was also caused by a decrease in the number of units wholesaled in 2002 due to an overall decline in new and used vehicle sales. Used vehicle total gross profit increased slightly in 2003 primarily due to increased wholesale gross profit. Used vehicle gross profit related to wholesale was positively impacted by our used vehicle market strategy resulting in fewer vehicles being wholesaled. In 2004, we are continuing to focus on comprehensive training of used vehicle personnel as well as implementing across all of our stores a web based used vehicle inventory tool that enables our stores within each of our markets to communicate with each other to optimize their used vehicle inventory supply, mix and pricing. The decrease in used vehicle gross profit in 2002 compared to 2001 was the result of pricing pressures from manufacturer new vehicle incentives and an oversupply of used vehicles in the marketplace. 25 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2003 2002 (Unfavorable) Variance 2001 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue $ 2,457.2 $ 2,453.3 $ 3.9 .2 $ 2,404.9 $ 48.4 2.0 Gross profit $ 1,072.2 $ 1,068.3 $ 3.9 .4 $ 1,039.2 $ 29.1 2.8 Same Store: Revenue $ 2,411.4 $ 2,408.1 $ 3.3 .1 Gross profit $ 1,051.3 $ 1,048.7 $ 2.6 .2 Years Ended December 31, % 2003 % 2002 % 2001 Reported: Revenue mix percentage 12.7 12.6 12.0 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.6 43.5 43.2 Same Store: Revenue mix percentage 12.7 12.6 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.6 43.5 Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from repair orders for service labor and related parts paid directly by customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranties. Total parts and service revenue and gross profit remained relatively flat in 2003 compared to 2002. This was driven by improved pricing on customer paid work offset by decreases in warranty repair orders, wholesale parts and our collision repair business. Significant decreases in domestic warranty repair orders offset import and luxury increases realized in 2003. In 2004, we will remain focused on improving customer pay revenue and gross profit through initiatives that include implementing a standardized service process, optimizing our pricing for commonly performed vehicle services and repairs for like brand vehicles within each of our markets and using our standardized marketing communications with our customers. Revenue and gross profit in 2002 were impacted by reduced warranty volume from domestic manufacturers, and a soft collision repair market. The year 2001 included a large manufacturer recall. 26 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2003 2002 (Unfavorable) Variance 2001 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 601.1 $ 563.7 $ 37.4 6.6 $ 528.9 $ 34.8 6.6 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 911 $ 836 $ 75 9.0 $ 742 $ 94 12.7 Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 588.6 $ 555.8 $ 32.8 5.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 911 $ 838 $ 73 8.7 Years Ended December 31, % 2003 % 2002 % 2001 Reported: Revenue mix percentage 3.1 2.9 2.6 Same Store: Revenue mix percentage 3.1 2.9 Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased in 2003 primarily due to increased product penetration as a result of the continued usage of our menu based finance and insurance sales process. During 2003, we focused on our underperforming fourth quartile stores and provided intensive, ongoing training of finance and insurance associates in all of our stores. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we also substantially completed the transition to manufacturer extended warranty programs and expanded our lender network to include prime and non prime lenders. In addition, lower interest rates facilitated finance and insurance sales. Significantly higher interest rates in 2004 may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue. In 2002, increases were primarily due to increased product penetration as a result of our continued standardization of product pricing, our menu based finance and insurance sales process and low interest rates. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses In 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $43.2 million or 2%. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses improved 90 basis points as a result of our continued focus on cost cutting and operational improvements, particularly in the areas of compensation and other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increases in advertising expenses. In the area of compensation, we continue to focus on better aligning the compensation of employees with the performance of our stores and increasing the variability of our compensation expense. Total selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 decreased compared to 2001 primarily due to savings from decreased store selling, general and administration expenses particularly compensation expenses, partially offset by increases due to investments in strategic initiatives and related infrastructure. Amortization The decrease in amortization in 2002 was due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of new goodwill accounting rules effective January 1, 2002. Loan and Lease Underwriting Activities In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our stores, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. In 2003, we sold all of the related finance receivables portfolio to a third party and received proceeds equal to the net carrying value of the finance receivables and servicing liabilities at the closing date of the transactions totaling approximately $52 million, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. We continue to provide automobile loans and leases for our customers through unrelated third party financing sources. Loan and lease underwriting income in 2003 and 2002 was the result of our focus on the management of our finance receivables and improved collections prior to the sale of our finance receivables portfolio in 2003. Other Losses (Gains) Other losses for 2003 were primarily the result of a real estate impairment charge totaling $27.5 million related to three underperforming franchised new vehicle stores which currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores. Other gains in 2001 primarily consists of a $19.3 million pre tax gain from the sale of the New Jersey based Flemington dealership group. Non Operating Income (Expense) Floorplan Interest Expense Decreases in floorplan interest expense in 2003 and 2002 are primarily the result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher average inventory levels. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was not significant. There were no interest rate hedges in 2002 and 2001. See discussion in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Expense IRS Settlement As described below, in March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS. Interest expense IRS settlement is related to interest due under the agreement from the date of settlement. Other Interest Expense During 2003 and 2002, other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our mortgage facilities and the outstanding senior unsecured notes. The increase in 2003 is primarily due to incremental debt 28 Table of Contents and increased amortization expense resulting from payments made by us in connection with the November 2002 amendment to our senior unsecured notes partially offset by lower interest rates. Additionally, as a result of completed capital expenditure projects, there was a lower amount of interest expense capitalized to construction in progress in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher fixed interest expenses related to the senior unsecured notes sold in August 2001. Interest Income The 2003 decrease is primarily the result of lower average cash and investment balances combined with lower interest rates. The 2002 increase is primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income in 2003 primarily relates to the sale of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. As a result of the transaction, we liquidated related restricted assets, realizing a $3.1 million gain on the sale. Additionally, in 2002, we converted our remaining restricted investments to restricted cash, realizing a $2.7 million gain on the sale. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate was 14.4%, 38.3% and 38.9% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 primarily reflects the impact of the elimination of goodwill amortization, partially offset by increases to our effective state tax rates. Excluding the impact of the IRS settlement and tax adjustments, the effective income tax rate for 2003 was 38.3%. In March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions we entered into in 1997 and 1999, including a transaction that generally had the effect of accelerating projected tax deductions relating to health and welfare benefits. Under the agreement, we agreed to pay the IRS net aggregate payments of approximately $470 million, which included an initial net payment of approximately $350 million due in March 2004 and three subsequent net payments of approximately $40 million each due March 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In July 2003, we made a $366 million prepayment of the initial installment due March 2004 (net payment of $336 million, including a $30 million income tax benefit for the interest deduction). As a result of the settlement, during 2003, we recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. We continue to be under federal income tax audit for the years 1997 through 2001. Also during 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits totaling $13.4 million related to favorable tax adjustments and the resolution of various income tax matters. In future periods, we expect additional tax adjustments from the continued resolution of various income tax matters. Our effective tax rate in future periods may be negatively impacted by changes in our blended state income tax rates and adjustments for other tax matters. We expect our underlying effective rate to be approximately 39% in 2004. See Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Business Acquisitions and Divestitures During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we acquired various automotive retail businesses. We paid approximately $45.9 million, $158.4 million and $69.7 million, respectively, in cash for these acquisitions, all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We also paid 29 Table of Contents $3.2 million, $8.1 million and $22.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. In April 2001, we completed the sale of our New Jersey based Flemington dealership group for net proceeds of $59.0 million and a pre tax gain of $19.3 million. We expect that future acquisitions will continue to primarily target single stores and groups of stores focused in key existing markets. As of December 31, 2003, we had entered into agreements to purchase several automotive stores that represented purchase price commitments of approximately $86.0 million in cash. See Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of business combinations. Financial Condition At December 31, 2003, we had $170.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We have two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. A 364 day revolving credit facility provides borrowings up to $200.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate and was renewed in August 2003 for another 364 day term to August 2004. A five year facility, which expires in August 2006, provides borrowings up to $300.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate. These facilities are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, which directly or indirectly own substantially all of our stores, and are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. No amounts are drawn on these revolving credit facilities. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2003, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $87.2 million, including $56.4 million letters of credit, and have various expiration dates. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our multi year revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the letter of credit line, the amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. Due to changes in insurance requirements, letters of credit outstanding are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million in 2004. We also have $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Our revolving credit facilities, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes and mortgage facilities contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases), and make investments, and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The revolving credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of consolidated maximum cash flow leverage, minimum interest coverage, and maximum balance sheet leverage. Over the life of the revolving credit facilities, certain of the financial covenants become more restrictive as prescribed by a predetermined schedule. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage incurrence covenant, and the mortgage facilities contain both maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage covenants. In the event that we were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facilities or mortgage facilities and such default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should we be in violation of the financial covenants, we could be further limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. Our revolving credit facilities, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the mortgage facilities have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of ours. At December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants and do not anticipate any events of default. 30 Table of Contents In conjunction with the revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes offering, we received corporate credit ratings from rating agencies. The revolving credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes have provisions linked to credit ratings. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are impacted by changes in credit ratings. In the event of a downgrade in our credit rating, we would continue to have access to the revolving credit facilities, but at higher rates of interest. Certain covenants related to the senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with certain upgrades in ratings to investment grade. At December 31, 2003, we had $329.7 million outstanding under mortgage facilities with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. The facilities have an aggregate capacity of $400.0 million, which includes additional capacity obtained totaling $100.0 million during 2003. The facilities bear interest at LIBOR based interest rates and are secured by mortgages on certain of our stores real property. We drew additional amounts totaling $183.6 million of our available capacity under our mortgage facilities during 2003. We finance our new vehicle inventory through secured financings, primarily floorplan facilities, with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries as well as independent financial institutions. As of December 31, 2003, aggregate capacity of the facilities was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2003. We finance our used vehicle inventory primarily through our cash flow from operations. We sell and receive commissions on the following types of vehicle protection and other products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection, credit insurance, lease wear and tear insurance and theft protection products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements with these third party finance and vehicle protection product providers, we primarily sell the products on a straight commission basis, however, we may sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Through 2002, we assumed some of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer reinsure any new extended warranties and credit insurance products. We maintain restricted cash in trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our captive insurance subsidiaries. During 2003, we repurchased 39.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $575.2 million. Our Board has authorized us to acquire $3.0 billion of our common stock since 1998 and, through December 31, 2003, we have acquired 224.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 billion, leaving approximately $295.2 million authorized for repurchases at December 31, 2003. As of March 5, 2004, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $28.2 million, leaving approximately $267.0 million authorized for share repurchases. Repurchases are made pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock, the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of our capital such as strategic store acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses. Future share repurchases are also subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes and credit agreements relating to our two senior secured revolving credit facilities. On June 30, 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of ANC Rental Corporation (ANC Rental), which operated our former rental business. In connection with the spin off, we agreed to provide certain guarantees on behalf of ANC Rental. On November 13, 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. In May 2003, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement among AutoNation, ANC Rental and the Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy that resolved potential claims relating to ANC Rentals bankruptcy, including potential claims against us arising out of the spin off of ANC Rental (the Settlement Agreement). On October 14, 2003, with the approval of the 31 Table of Contents bankruptcy court, substantially all of ANC Rentals assets (the Rental Business) were sold to an entity controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. Following the sale, and pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we continue to guarantee $29.5 million, and have committed to guarantee up to an additional $10.5 million, in surety bonds supporting obligations of the Rental Business until December 2006. We also are obligated to pay one half of any permanent reduction of such guarantee obligations, or up to $20 million, to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy. As a result of our guarantees and potential payment obligations as described above, we incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million ($12.3 million after tax) included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements during 2003. The $20.0 million pre tax charge is comprised of estimated exposure under the current guarantees and potential payment obligations and $4.4 million for the estimated fair value of the potential additional $10.5 million in guarantees. In addition, based on the Settlement Agreement and assessment of the risks involved in each matter, and excluding the 2003 after tax charge of $12.3 million, we estimate remaining potential pre tax financial exposure related to ANC Rental of up to $20 million ($12 million after tax). As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Other tax accruals totaled $307.3 million and $361.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and relate to various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. These matters are expected to be resolved within the next two years. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. See Note 14, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes, including the impact of our March 2003 settlement with the IRS. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $(5.4) million, $48.1 million and $43.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $263.9 million, $542.5 million and $540.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in floorplan notes payable which directly relate to new vehicle inventory. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 was driven mainly by the IRS settlement payment of $366.0 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, activity from our former installment loan portfolio (all of which was sold in 2003), purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $123.5 million, $163.4 million and $156.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Approximately half of our capital investments during 2003 related to required improvements of our existing stores. The balance of our capital investments during 2003 related to upgrades to existing stores and construction of new stores. We will make additional facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect capital expenditures in 2004 to be in line with 2003, excluding acquisition related spending and opportunistic lease buy outs. 32 Table of Contents Property operating lease buy outs were $9.8 million, $19.8 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We continue to analyze certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. From January 1, 2004 through March 5, 2004, we have executed $77.3 million in lease buy outs. Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale were $23.1 million, $34.8 million and $71.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastore and other properties held for sale. Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $49.1 million, $166.5 million and $92.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003, the Company acquired thirteen automotive retail franchises and other related assets. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes $3.2 million, $8.1 million and $22.3 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion under the heading Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and in Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, we received $59.0 million of cash from the divestiture of our New Jersey based Flemington dealership group. As part of our restructuring activities in 2001 we divested of certain non core franchised automotive stores for which we received $2.2 million of cash. See further discussion under the heading Business Acquisitions and Divestitures and in Note 18, Acquisitions and Divestitures, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Collections of installment loan receivables and other related items totaled $27.0 million, $86.7 million and $551.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our stores, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. We continue to provide automotive loans and leases for our customers through unrelated third party finance sources. In July 2003, we sold all of our finance receivables portfolio to a third party and received proceeds equal to the net carrying value of the finance receivables and servicing liabilities at the closing date of the transaction totaling $52.4 million, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. We transferred $66.6 million of restricted assets to the third party insurance company in exchange for the assumption of the related insurance reserves. During 2001, we moved various restricted cash deposits related to certain insurance programs to a series of restricted investments. See Note 4, Restricted Assets and Reinsurance, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2003, we sold all of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, proceeds from mortgage facilities and stock option exercises. We have repurchased approximately 39.2 million, 30.7 million and 27.3 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for an aggregate price of $575.2 million, $389.9 million and $256.8 million, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchase programs. We are targeting 2004 combined spending on acquisitions and share repurchases of approximately $400 million. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we drew amounts totaling $183.6 million, $7.3 million and $153.3 million, respectively, under our mortgage facilities. 33 Table of Contents During 2001, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $434.7 million. These proceeds, along with the mortgage facilities drawn on in 2001, were used to repay outstanding amounts under revolving credit facilities totaling $615.0 million and certain other debt in 2001. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $142.2 million, $78.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Increased activity in 2003 and 2002 was due to higher market prices for our common stock, which resulted in more exercises of stock options outstanding. A substantial portion of stock option exercises during the first six months of 2002 were made by former employees who had retained stock options as part of the ANC Rental spin off on June 30, 2000. These options generally expired on June 30, 2002. Other cash used in financing activities totaled $(7.8) million in 2003 and primarily includes upfront premium amounts paid in conjunction with interest rate hedge transactions. Other cash used in financing activities totaled $11.8 million in 2002 and includes amounts paid in November 2002 related to consents obtained from the holders of our $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes to amend the indenture governing such notes and from the lenders to amend our revolving credit facilities, allowing us to repurchase additional shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we repaid approximately $176.5 million of debt obligations primarily related to amounts financed under a lease facility. See Note 8, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations Cash used in discontinued operations was $4.7 million and $8.4 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used in 2003 and 2002 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental. There was no cash used in discontinued operations in 2001. Liquidity We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floorplan notes payable, revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements, payments due under the IRS settlement, payment of tax obligations, commitments and contingencies and any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to finance capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and share repurchases through cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financings. We do not foresee any difficulty in continuing to comply with covenants of our various financing facilities. At December 31, 2003, we had available capacity under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities and available cash totaling approximately $675 million, net of outstanding letters of credit. We will continue to optimize our capital structure. We will continue to evaluate the best use of our operating cash flow between capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reduction. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the credit agreements for our two revolving credit facilities restrict our ability to declare cash dividends. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2003 (in millions): Payments Due by Period After 5 Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Floorplan notes payable (Note 3)* $ 2,809.8 $ 2,809.8 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 8)* 824.4 15.9 155.1 508.5 144.9 Operating lease commitments (Note 9)* 405.6 63.9 104.1 79.3 158.3 IRS tax settlement payable (Note 14)* 124.0 82.7 41.3 Acquisition purchase price commitments 86.0 81.9 4.1 Lease buy out commitments 77.3 77.3 Purchase obligations 85.2 59.9 13.9 4.7 6.7 Total $ 4,412.3 $ 3,108.7 $ 359.9 $ 633.8 $ 309.9 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2003, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $87.2 million, including $56.4 million letters of credit, and have various expiration dates. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our multi year revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the letter of credit line, the amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. Due to changes in insurance requirements, letters of credit outstanding are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million in 2004. As further discussed under the heading Financial Condition, in connection with ANC Rentals spin off, we provide certain credit enhancements and guarantees with respect to financial and other performance obligations of ANC Rental. The timing of when these obligations will be satisfied is difficult to estimate, although we believe it is likely that the majority will be satisfied in the next three years. As further discussed under the heading Financial Condition, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. These matters are expected to be resolved within the next two years. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by other factors unrelated to season, such as automotive manufacturer incentives programs. New Accounting Pronouncements As of January 1, 2003, we adopted EITF Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. EITF 02 16, as it applies to us, addresses the recognition of certain manufacturer allowances and requires that manufacturer allowances be treated as a reduction of inventory cost unless specifically identified as reimbursement for services or costs incurred. The adoption of EITF 02 16 resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of $9.1 million of income 35 Table of Contents tax, totaling $14.6 million to reflect the deferral of certain allowances, primarily floorplan assistance, into inventory cost. The impact of this accounting change for the year ended December 31, 2003 was an increase of $3.3 million in Cost of Sales. On a comparable basis, the impact of this accounting change for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 would have been an increase of $4.7 million and a decrease of $11.6 million, respectively, in Cost of Sales. Additionally, the adoption of EITF 02 16 impacted the accounting for certain manufacturers advertising allowances resulting in a reclassification that increased Selling, General and Administrative expenses and, correspondingly, reduced Cost of Sales by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to now reflect these allowances as a reduction of Cost of Sales. On a comparable basis, the reclassification to increase Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and to reduce Cost of Sales for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 would have been $19.5 million and $21.4 million, respectively. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS 143 requires that entities record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it was incurred. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires the recognition of a liability for certain guarantee obligations issued or modified after December 31, 2002. FIN 45 also clarifies disclosure requirements to be made by a guarantor for certain guarantees. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 were effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 as of December 31, 2002 and have adopted the accounting requirements effective January 1, 2003, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 16, Discontinued Operations, for discussion of the accounting treatment of potential future guarantees. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00 21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of APB No. 50, (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities, as defined, to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46, as amended, is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN 46R) to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and defer the implementation date for certain entities to periods ending after March 14, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R, as revised, are not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS 149 amends certain other existing pronouncements. SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers. EITF 03 10 provides guidance on how to account for sales incentive arrangements provided by manufacturers to consumers and accepted by resellers. The provisions of EITF 03 10 apply to fiscal years beginning after November 25, 2003. The adoption of EITF 03 10 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is cyclical and is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are dependent in large part on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. Our stores are dependent on the programs and operations of vehicle manufacturers and, therefore, any changes to such programs and operations may adversely affect our store operations and, in turn, affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws, regulation and scrutiny. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. 37 Table of Contents Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive stores in key markets on favorable terms or at all. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan notes payable, revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. We must test our intangibles for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. At December 31, 2003, fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, totaled $494.7 million and had a fair value of $557.1 million. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had variable rate floorplan notes payable totaling $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $28.0 million and $23.0 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to floorplan notes payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. Net of floorplan assistance, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $23.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, change to our net inventory carrying costs. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $329.7 million and $153.2 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $3.3 million and $1.5 million change to interest expense, respectively. Hedging Risk We comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 133, 137, 138 and 149 (collectively SFAS 133) pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. In accordance with SFAS 133, we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. All of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we entered into a series of interest rate hedge transactions, consisting of a combination of forward starting swaps, and cap and floor options (collars) with a notional value of $800.0 million, designed to convert certain floating rate floorplan notes payable and mortgage notes to fixed rate debt. We have $200 million in notional swaps, which start in 2004 and effectively lock in a rate of 3.0%, and $600 million in notional collars that cap floating rates to a maximum rate no greater than 2.4%. All of our hedges mature over the next three years. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net unrealized losses related to hedges included in other comprehensive loss were $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2003, all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. We had no outstanding derivatives at December 31, 2002. 38 Table of Contents
