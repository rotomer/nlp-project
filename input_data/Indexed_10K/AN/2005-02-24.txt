Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Our parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. In 2004, we determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new 18 Table of Contents and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. We revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on total gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends. The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $84 million, $82 million, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and for used vehicles by $195 million, $191 million and $189 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, our revenue based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2004, we owned and operated 358 new vehicle franchises from 281 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 35 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 98% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2004, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We operate in a single industry segment, automotive retailing. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing operating expenses, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across all of our stores. The automotive retailing industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation characterized by periods of oversupply of new vehicles and weak consumer demand although the impact on retailers has been mitigated in recent years by lower interest rates and higher manufacturer incentives. We believe that many factors affect industry wide sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins, including consumer confidence in the economy, the level of manufacturers excess production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates, the prospects of war, other international conflicts or terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, the level of personal discretionary spending, product quality, affordability and innovation, fuel prices, credit availability, unemployment rates, the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles. During 2004, we experienced revenue growth in each of our business lines while leveraging our cost structure and reducing new and used vehicle inventory levels. The year ended December 31, 2004 was marked by a number of accomplishments, including the implementation of a streamlined operational structure, the successful transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising interest rate environment, especially in regard to inventories, and the launch of the AutoNation Pledge. The AutoNation Pledge is our commitment to provide our customers with disclosures relating to the finance and insurance sales process. In 2005, we anticipate that new vehicle sales will remain stable in the United States and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2005 is very difficult to predict. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had net income from continuing operations of $396.4 million and $515.2 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.45 and $1.80, respectively. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits in continuing operations totaling $25.8 million and $140.9 million (which includes $127.5 million recognized as a result of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement), respectively, primarily related to resolution of various income tax matters. 19 Table of Contents During 2004, we had income from discontinued operations totaling $37.2 million, net of income taxes. In 2004, we recognized a $52.2 million gain included in discontinued operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters related to items previously reported in discontinued operations. We also recognized a loss totaling $13.9 million, net of income taxes, related to stores that were sold or for which we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, have been adjusted to classify the results of the stores described above as discontinued operations. Additionally, 2003 was impacted by a loss from discontinued operations due to an agreement reached with ANC Rental and a charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change for manufacturer allowances, primarily related to floorplan assistance. During 2004, we acquired 14.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $236.8 million. As of February 18, 2005, we repurchased an additional .2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0 million, leaving approximately $304.4 million available for share repurchases under the repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior notes contain restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. During 2004, 8.7 million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options resulting in proceeds of $94.2 million. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible and Long Lived Assets Our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible and long lived assets, which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business. We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. 20 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized. We may also participate in future underwriting profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, and for accruals related to self insurance programs, certain legal proceedings and estimated tax liabilities. 21 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2002 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 11,891.6 $ 11,488.7 $ 402.9 3.5 $ 11,326.6 $ 162.1 1.4 Used vehicle 4,319.9 4,195.2 124.7 3.0 4,382.5 (187.3 ) (4.3 ) Parts and service 2,505.3 2,398.6 106.7 4.4 2,388.2 10.4 .4 Finance and insurance, net 618.5 589.9 28.6 4.8 548.2 41.7 7.6 Other 89.4 39.0 50.4 56.0 (17.0 ) Total revenue $ 19,424.7 $ 18,711.4 $ 713.3 3.8 $ 18,701.5 $ 9.9 .1 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 846.3 $ 838.9 $ 7.4 .9 $ 889.9 $ (51.0 ) (5.7 ) Used vehicle 401.6 393.6 8.0 2.0 384.0 9.6 2.5 Parts and service 1,096.8 1,046.3 50.5 4.8 1,039.1 7.2 .7 Finance and insurance 618.5 589.9 28.6 4.8 548.2 41.7 7.6 Other 49.5 33.9 15.6 49.2 (15.3 ) Total gross profit 3,012.7 2,902.6 110.1 3.8 2,910.4 (7.8 ) (.3 ) Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,158.7 2,096.9 (61.8 ) (2.9 ) 2,132.4 35.5 1.7 Depreciation 81.9 67.7 (14.2 ) 65.5 (2.2 ) Amortization 1.2 1.6 .4 2.4 .8 Other losses (gains) 4.0 10.0 6.0 (10.5 ) (20.5 ) Operating income 766.9 726.4 40.5 5.6 720.6 5.8 .8 Floorplan interest expense (81.8 ) (68.9 ) (12.9 ) (18.7 ) (71.8 ) 2.9 4.0 Other interest expense (76.9 ) (71.8 ) (5.1 ) (7.1 ) (50.5 ) (21.3 ) (42.2 ) Interest income 3.5 3.4 .1 2.9 10.4 (7.0 ) (67.3 ) Other income (expense), net (5.1 ) 16.7 (21.8 ) 6.9 9.8 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 606.6 $ 605.8 $ .8 .1 $ 615.6 $ (9.8 ) (1.6 ) Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 410,621 406,675 3,946 1.0 415,787 (9,112 ) (2.2 ) Used vehicle 239,999 238,271 1,728 .7 239,564 (1,293 ) (.5 ) 650,620 644,946 5,674 .9 655,351 (10,405 ) (1.6 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 28,960 $ 28,250 $ 710 2.5 $ 27,241 $ 1,009 3.7 Used vehicle $ 14,667 $ 14,377 $ 290 2.0 $ 14,556 $ (179 ) (1.2 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,061 $ 2,063 $ (2 ) (.1 ) $ 2,140 $ (77 ) (3.6 ) Used vehicle $ 1,669 $ 1,642 $ 27 1.6 $ 1,633 $ 9 .6 Finance and insurance $ 951 $ 915 $ 36 3.9 $ 836 $ 79 9.4 22 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2004 % 2003 % 2002 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 61.2 61.4 60.6 Used vehicle 22.2 22.4 23.4 Parts and service 12.9 12.8 12.8 Finance and insurance, net 3.2 3.2 2.9 Other .5 .2 .3 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 28.1 28.9 30.6 Used vehicle 13.3 13.6 13.2 Parts and service 36.4 36.0 35.7 Finance and insurance 20.5 20.3 18.8 Other 1.7 1.2 1.7 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.1 7.3 7.9 Used vehicle 11.4 11.4 11.2 Parts and service 43.8 43.6 43.5 Total 15.5 15.5 15.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.1 11.2 11.4 Operating income 3.9 3.9 3.9 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 71.7 72.2 73.3 Operating income 25.5 25.0 24.8 December 31, 2004 2003 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 53 days 71 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 37 days 43 days The following table details the net floorplan benefit consisting of floorplan assistance, a component of new vehicle gross profit, and floorplan interest expense.

Same store new vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003. Although same store revenue per unit increased, it was partially offset by a decrease in same store unit volume. The increase in same store average revenue per unit retailed was attributable to increased dealer incentives and a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles. The decrease in same store unit volume is consistent with industry trends for our brand and market mix. The same store unit volume decrease was also due in part to the four major hurricanes that caused store closings and substantial disruption of our business throughout Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Same store gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased during 2004 due to intense competition at the retail level and high average inventory levels during the year. At December 31, 2004, our new vehicle inventories were at $2.2 billion or 53 days supply, an improvement compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.4 billion or 71 days supply at December 31, 2003. This improvement was due to our continued focus on managing inventory levels and higher sales rates during December 2004, although industry inventory levels remain high. In 2005, we anticipate that new vehicle sales will remain stable in the United States and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2005 is very difficult to predict. New vehicle revenue for 2003 was relatively flat compared to 2002 as the average revenue per unit increase was offset by a decrease in unit volume. The average increase in revenue per unit was attributable to a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles. The decrease in unit volume is primarily due to lower consumer demand in certain markets in which we operate and for certain brands sold by us. We experienced downward pressure on our new vehicle gross profit margins during 2003, which we believe was largely due to high inventory levels and intense competition in the industry. The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) decreased in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily as a result of increased floorplan interest expense due to higher interest rates and higher average inventory levels during 2004. In 2005, we expect the net inventory carrying benefit to decrease due to higher interest rates partially offset by expected lower inventory levels. 25 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2002 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,520.1 $ 3,425.6 $ 94.5 2.8 $ 3,487.2 $ (61.6 ) (1.8 ) Wholesale revenue 799.8 769.6 30.2 3.9 895.3 (125.7 ) (14.0 ) Total revenue $ 4,319.9 $ 4,195.2 $ 124.7 3.0 $ 4,382.5 $ (187.3 ) (4.3 ) Retail gross profit $ 400.5 $ 391.2 $ 9.3 2.4 $ 391.1 $ .1 Wholesale gross profit 1.1 2.4 (1.3 ) (7.1 ) 9.5 Total gross profit $ 401.6 $ 393.6 $ 8.0 2.0 $ 384.0 $ 9.6 2.5 Retail vehicle unit sales 239,999 238,271 1,728 .7 239,564 (1,293 ) (.5 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 14,667 $ 14,377 $ 290 2.0 $ 14,556 $ (179 ) (1.2 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,669 $ 1,642 $ 27 1.6 $ 1,633 $ 9 .6 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.4 % 11.4 % 11.2 % Days supply (trailing 30 days) 37 days 43 days Same Store: Retail revenue $ 3,440.1 $ 3,408.0 $ 32.1 .9 Wholesale revenue 764.6 764.3 .3 Total revenue $ 4,204.7 $ 4,172.3 $ 32.4 .8 Retail gross profit $ 393.9 $ 389.3 $ 4.6 1.2 Wholesale gross profit (1.5 ) 2.7 (4.2 ) Total gross profit $ 392.4 $ 392.0 $ .4 .1 Retail vehicle unit sales 236,382 236,893 (511 ) (.2 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 14,553 $ 14,386 $ 167 1.2 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,666 $ 1,643 $ 23 1.4 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.5 % 11.4 % Reported used vehicle performance for 2004 benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store used vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003 as a result of an increase in same store average revenue per unit partially offset by a slight decrease in same store unit volume. The decline in used vehicle unit volume is in part due to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles. Used vehicle revenue was also impacted by decreased unit sales volume in part due to the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Same store gross profit for 2004 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2003. Same store gross profit as a percentage of revenue for 2004 increased 10 basis points to 11.5% as a result of an improved inventory mix and a strengthening used vehicle market toward the end of 2004. Used vehicle total revenue for 2003 decreased as compared to 2002 as a result of a decrease in wholesale revenue and lower used vehicle retail unit volume and revenue per vehicle retailed. Wholesale revenue decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of fewer trade ins due to decreased new vehicle unit volume and improved management of our used vehicle inventory. The revenue per vehicle retailed decrease reflects lower prices as a function of our shift in inventory to lower cost units. Used vehicle total gross profit increased slightly in 2003 primarily due to increased wholesale gross profit, which was positively impacted by our used vehicle market strategy resulting in fewer vehicles being wholesaled. Used vehicle inventories were at $295.9 million or 37 days supply at December 31, 2004, which represents a 6 day improvement compared to 2003 driven by our continued focus on stocking a better mix of units through the use of our used vehicle management programs and a strengthening used vehicle market toward the end of 2004. 26 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) Variance 2002 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue $ 2,505.3 $ 2,398.6 $ 106.7 4.4 $ 2,388.2 $ 10.4 .4 Gross profit $ 1,096.8 $ 1,046.3 $ 50.5 4.8 $ 1,039.1 $ 7.2 .7 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.8 % 43.6 % 43.5% Same Store: Revenue $ 2,455.2 $ 2,383.4 $ 71.8 3.0 Gross profit $ 1,072.2 $ 1,039.8 $ 32.4 3.1 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.7 % 43.6 % Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from repair orders for service labor and related parts paid directly by customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranties. Reported parts and service revenue and gross profit for 2004 benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store parts and service revenue and gross profit increased during 2004 due to increases in customer paid work for parts and service, attributable to the continued implementation of our service drive process, maintenance menu and service marketing program, as well as optimization of our pricing models and training programs. Parts and service was also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Results in 2004 benefited from an additional service day as compared to the same period in 2003. Total parts and service revenue and gross profit remained relatively flat in 2003 compared to 2002. This was driven by improved pricing on customer paid work offset by decreases in warranty repair orders, wholesale parts and our collision repair business. Significant decreases in domestic warranty repair orders offset import and luxury increases realized in 2003. 27 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) Variance 2002 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 618.5 $ 589.9 $ 28.6 4.8 $ 548.2 $ 41.7 7.6 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 951 $ 915 $ 36 3.9 $ 836 $ 79 9.4 Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 609.2 $ 587.6 $ 21.6 3.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 954 $ 915 $ 39 4.3 Reported finance and insurance revenue and gross profit for 2004 benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased for 2004 due to increased vehicle revenue, product penetration and retrospective commissions received on extended warranties. Additionally, our improvement has been driven by our ongoing concentration on our fourth quartile stores and our transparent sales process that is supported by the AutoNation Pledge. The AutoNation Pledge is our commitment to provide our customers with disclosures relating to the finance and insurance sales process. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit were also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Substantially higher interest rates in the future may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased in 2003 primarily due to increased product penetration as a result of the continued usage of our menu based finance and insurance sales process. During 2003, we focused on our underperforming fourth quartile stores and provided intensive, ongoing training of finance and insurance associates in all of our stores. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we also substantially completed the transition to manufacturer extended warranty programs and expanded our lender network to include prime and non prime lenders. In addition, lower interest rates facilitated finance and insurance sales. 28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $61.8 million or 2.9%. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 50 basis points during 2004. Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volumes and gross margins that did not materialize through the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter, our results benefited from increased vehicle sales, as well as cost control and productivity improvements. Throughout 2004, we have continued to leverage our cost structure, especially in the areas of compensation and, to a lesser extent, advertising and occupancy costs. Occupancy costs benefited from lease buy outs completed in 2004. In September 2004, we announced a new streamlined regional structure that is expected to produce an annual reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses of $30 million through cost control and productivity improvements. Charges associated with the reorganization, primarily severance, totaled $2.9 million for 2004 and are included in Other Losses in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we continue to centralize certain key store level accounting and administrative activities in certain of our operating regions, which we expect will reduce our operating costs and improve our operating efficiency. In 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased compared to 2002 as a result of our continued focus on cost cutting and operational improvements, particularly in the areas of compensation and other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increases in advertising expenses. Other Losses (Gains) Other losses for 2003 were primarily the result of a real estate impairment charge totaling $17.6 million related to two underperforming franchised new vehicle stores which currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores. We also recognized an additional real estate impairment charge in 2003 totaling $9.9 million ($6.1 million, net of taxes) included in loss from Discontinued Operations related to an underperforming franchised new vehicle store which operated in a converted used vehicle megastore. Non Operating Income (Expense) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $81.8 million, $68.9 million and $71.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is primarily the result of higher average inventory levels and higher interest rates during 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was additional expense of $2.9 million and $.6 million, respectively. There were no interest rate hedges in 2002. See discussion in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The decrease in floorplan interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily the result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher average inventory levels. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under mortgage facilities and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $76.9 million, $71.8 million and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other interest expense also includes interest related to the IRS settlement totaling $4.8 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and represents interest due under the agreement from the date of the settlement. The increase in other interest expense for 2004 compared to 2003, excluding amounts related to the IRS settlement, is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding. During 2004, we repurchased $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 114.3% of face value or $3.9 million. The $.5 million premium we paid for this repurchase was recognized as Other Interest Expense in the accompanying 2004 Consolidated Income Statement. 29 Table of Contents The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and increased amortization expense resulting from payments made by us in connection with the November 2002 amendment to our senior unsecured notes partially offset by lower interest rates. Additionally, as a result of completed capital expenditure projects, there was a lower amount of interest expense capitalized to construction in progress in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest Income Interest income for 2004 was virtually unchanged compared to 2003. The 2003 decrease compared to 2002 is primarily the result of lower average cash and investment balances combined with lower interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income in 2003 primarily relates to the sale of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. As a result of the transaction, we liquidated related restricted assets, realizing a $3.1 million gain on the sale. Additionally, in 2002, we converted our remaining restricted investments to restricted cash, realizing a $2.7 million gain on the sale. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate was 34.7%, 15.0% and 38.3% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions we entered into in 1997 and 1999. As a result of the settlement, during 2003, we recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. In 2003, we made a $366.0 million prepayment of the initial installment due March 2004, including interest. Additionally, in 2004, we prepaid the remaining balance due related to the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million, including accrued interest. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits in continuing operations totaling $25.8 million and $140.9 million (which includes $127.5 million recognized as a result of the IRS settlement discussed above), respectively, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. We also recognized a $52.2 million gain included in Discontinued Operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters. Our underlying base effective tax rate for 2004 before adjustments was 39%. We substantially completed the federal income tax audit for the years 1997 through 2001 and a federal income tax audit for 2002 and 2003 was recently initiated by the IRS. We are routinely audited by the states in which we do business and remain under examination by various states for the tax years discussed above. We expect additional state and federal tax adjustments over the next eighteen months as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Financial Condition At December 31, 2004, we had $107.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We have two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. A 364 day revolving credit facility provides borrowing capacity of up to $200.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate and was renewed in August 2004 for another 364 day term to August 2005. A five year facility, which expires in August 2006, provides borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million at a LIBOR based interest rate. These facilities are 30 Table of Contents secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, which directly or indirectly own substantially all of our stores, and are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. There were no borrowings on these revolving credit facilities during 2004 and 2003. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our multi year revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the $300.0 million multi year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $77.0 million at December 31, 2004. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2004, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $107.1 million, including $77.0 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We also have $443.2 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. During 2004, we repurchased $3.4 million (face value) of senior unsecured notes at an average price of 114.3% of face value or $3.9 million. The $.5 million in premium we paid for this repurchase was recognized as Other Interest Expense in the accompanying 2004 Consolidated Income Statement. As of February 18, 2005, we repurchased an additional $3.8 million (face value) of senior unsecured notes at a price of 113.5% of face value or $4.4 million. The $.6 million in premium we paid for this repurchase will be recognized as Other Interest Expense in 2005. The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Our revolving credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and mortgage facilities contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases), to make investments, and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The revolving credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of consolidated maximum cash flow leverage, minimum interest coverage, and maximum balance sheet leverage. Over the life of the revolving credit facilities, certain of the financial covenants become more restrictive as prescribed by a predetermined schedule. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage incurrence covenant, and the mortgage facilities contain both maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage covenants. In the event that we were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facilities or mortgage facilities and such default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should we be in violation of the financial covenants, we could be further limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. Our revolving credit facilities, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the mortgage facilities have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of ours. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants and do not anticipate any events of default. We maintain corporate credit ratings from rating agencies. During 2004, we received a credit upgrade to investment grade from Standard & Poors. Now the Company, our revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes carry investment grade ratings from Standard & Poors. Although Moodys credit ratings are currently non investment grade, they raised the ratings outlook to positive from stable for the Company, our revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes. The revolving credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes have provisions linked to credit ratings. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are impacted by changes in credit ratings. In the event of a downgrade in our credit rating, we would continue to have access to the revolving credit facilities, although potentially at higher rates of interest. Certain covenants related to the senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with certain upgrades in ratings to investment grade. At December 31, 2004 we had $318.1 million outstanding under mortgage facilities with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. The facilities have an aggregate capacity of $400.0 million. The facilities bear interest at LIBOR based interest rates and are secured by mortgages on certain of our store properties. 31 Table of Contents We finance our new vehicle inventory through secured financings, primarily floorplan facilities, with automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries as well as independent financial institutions. As of December 31, 2004, aggregate capacity of the facilities to finance new vehicles was approximately $3.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2004. We generally do not utilize floorplan facilities to finance our used vehicle inventory. We sell and receive commissions on the following types of vehicle protection and other products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection, credit insurance, lease wear and tear insurance and theft protection products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements with these third party finance and vehicle protection product providers, we primarily sell the products on a straight commission basis, however, we may sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Through 2002, we assumed some of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2003, we have not reinsured any new extended warranties or credit insurance products. We maintain restricted cash in trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our captive insurance subsidiaries. During 2004, we repurchased 14.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $236.8 million. As of February 18, 2005, we repurchased an additional .2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0 million, leaving $304.4 million authorized for share repurchases, including an additional $250.0 million share repurchase authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2004. Repurchases are made pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock, the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of our capital such as strategic store acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses. Future share repurchases are also subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes and credit agreements relating to our two senior secured revolving credit facilities. On June 30, 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of ANC Rental Corporation (ANC Rental), which operated our former rental business. In connection with the spin off, we agreed to provide certain guarantees on behalf of ANC Rental. On November 13, 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. In May 2003, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement among AutoNation, ANC Rental and the Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy that resolved potential claims relating to ANC Rentals bankruptcy, including potential claims against us arising out of the spin off of ANC Rental (the Settlement Agreement). On October 14, 2003, with the approval of the bankruptcy court, substantially all of ANC Rentals assets (the Rental Business) were sold to an entity controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. Following the sale, and pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we continued to guarantee $29.5 million, and committed to guarantee up to an additional $10.5 million, in surety bonds supporting obligations of the Rental Business until December 2006. On June 30, 2004, we were released from our $29.5 million guarantee obligation, and on August 11, 2004, we were released from our remaining $10.5 million surety bond guarantee obligations. This triggered an obligation under the Settlement Agreement for us to pay $20 million (one half of the permanent reduction of the surety bond guarantee obligations) to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy, which payment was made on September 10, 2004. We had previously incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million ($12.3 million after tax) for this liability included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements during 2003. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Other tax accruals totaled $181.3 million and $307.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and relate to various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we 32 Table of Contents have adequately provided for these matters. We substantially completed the federal income tax audit for the years 1997 through 2001 and a federal income tax audit for 2002 and 2003 was recently initiated by the IRS. We remain under examination by various states for the tax years discussed above. We expect additional state and federal tax adjustments over the next eighteen months as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents (decreased) increased by $(66.2) million, $(5.9) million and $46.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $441.8 million, $365.8 million and $627.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in vehicle floorplan payable, which directly relates to changes in new vehicle inventory. Additionally, we paid portions of the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million and $366.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing the entire balance of the amount due under the settlement. During 2004, we reclassified certain amounts in the 2003 and 2002 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing activities to operating activities, including certain items related to our former loan underwriting business, as a result of recent guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our stores, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. In July 2003, we sold all of our finance receivables portfolio for proceeds totaling $52.4 million, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. Collections of installment loans receivable and other items related to the wind down of this business totaled $27.0 million and $86.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $133.2 million, $122.7 million and $162.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect 2005 capital expenditures of approximately $130 million, excluding any acquisition related spending or lease buy outs. Property operating lease buy outs were $77.7 million, $9.8 million and $19.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We continue to analyze certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale were $37.9 million, $23.1 million and $34.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastores and other properties held for sale. 33 Table of Contents Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $197.9 million, $48.8 million and $166.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, the Company acquired eight automotive retail franchises and other related assets. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2004, 2003 and 2002 includes $3.3 million, $3.2 million and $8.1 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion in Note 16, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2002, one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company. We transferred $66.6 million of restricted assets to the third party insurance company in exchange for the assumption of the related insurance accruals. See Note 4, Restricted Assets and Reinsurance, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2003, we sold all of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, proceeds from mortgage facilities and stock option exercises. We have repurchased approximately 14.1 million, 39.2 million and 30.7 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for an aggregate price of $236.8 million, $575.2 million and $389.9 million, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchase programs. Our 2005 target for combined spending on acquisitions and share repurchases is approximately $300 million. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we drew amounts totaling $183.6 million and $7.3 million, respectively, under our mortgage facilities. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $94.2 million, $118.1 million and $78.7 million, respectively. During 2004, we repurchased $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 114.3% of face value or $3.9 million. Other cash used in financing activities totaled $7.8 million in 2003 and primarily includes upfront premium amounts paid in conjunction with interest rate hedge transactions. In addition, other cash used in financing activities totaled $11.8 million in 2002 and includes amounts paid in November 2002 related to consents obtained from the holders of our $450.0 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes to amend the indenture governing such notes and from the lenders to amend our revolving credit facilities, allowing us to repurchase additional shares of our common stock. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations Cash used in discontinued operations was $21.1 million, $4.7 million and $8.4 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A portion of the cash used in 2004 and all of the cash used in 2003 and 2002 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental. Liquidity We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our vehicle floorplan facilities, revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements, payment of tax obligations, commitments and contingencies and any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to finance capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and share repurchases through cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financings. We do not foresee any difficulty in continuing to comply with covenants of our various financing 34 Table of Contents facilities. At December 31, 2004, we had available cash and available capacity under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities totaling approximately $578 million, net of outstanding letters of credit. We will continue to evaluate the best use of our operating cash flow between capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt reduction, including possible limited repurchases of our senior unsecured notes and or prepayments of our mortgage facilities. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes and the credit agreements for our revolving credit facilities restrict our ability to declare cash dividends. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2004 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total one Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 2,517.3 $ 2,517.3 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 8)* 812.6 14.9 68.6 593.7 135.4 Operating lease commitments (Note 9)* 494.0 60.1 99.8 77.4 256.7 Acquisition purchase price commitments 10.5 10.5 Purchase obligations 140.1 51.2 34.1 27.3 27.5 Total $ 3,974.5 $ 2,654.0 $ 202.5 $ 698.4 $ 419.6 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2004, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $107.1 million, including $77.0 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our multi year revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the letter of credit line, the amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed under the heading Financial Condition, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events, and by other factors unrelated to season, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision of SFAS 123. The standard 35 Table of Contents requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. In accordance with the revised statement, we will be required to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to June 30, 2005. We are evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R. We have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 1, 2003, we adopted EITF Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. EITF 02 16, as it applies to us, addresses the recognition of certain manufacturer allowances and requires that manufacturer allowances be treated as a reduction of inventory cost unless specifically identified as reimbursement for services or costs incurred. The adoption of EITF 02 16 resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of $9.1 million of income tax, totaling $14.6 million to reflect the deferral of certain allowances, primarily floorplan assistance, into inventory cost during 2003. The impact of this accounting change for the year ended December 31, 2003 was an increase of $3.3 million in Cost of Sales. On a comparable basis, the impact of this accounting change for the year ended December 31, 2002 would have been an increase of $4.7 million in Cost of Sales. Additionally, the adoption of EITF 02 16 impacted the accounting for certain manufacturers advertising allowances resulting in a reclassification that increased Selling, General and Administrative expenses and, correspondingly, reduced Cost of Sales by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to now reflect these allowances as a reduction of Cost of Sales. On a comparable basis, the reclassification to increase Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and to reduce Cost of Sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 would have been $19.5 million. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of APB No. 50, (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities, as defined, to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46, as amended, is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN 46R) to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and defer the implementation date for certain entities to periods ending after March 14, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers. EITF 03 10 provides guidance on how to account for sales incentive arrangements provided by manufacturers to consumers and accepted by resellers. The provisions of EITF 03 10 apply to fiscal years beginning after November 25, 2003. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our 36 Table of Contents forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is cyclical and is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent in large part on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and for the brands we represent, as well as the level of gross margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. Our stores are dependent on the programs and operations of vehicle manufacturers and, therefore, any changes to such programs and operations may adversely affect our store operations and, in turn, affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws, regulation and scrutiny. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive stores in key markets on favorable terms or at all. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payable, revolving credit facilities and mortgage facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. We must test our intangibles for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. At December 31, 2004, fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, totaled $494.5 million and had a fair value of $561.5 million. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had variable rate vehicle floorplan payable totaling $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $25.2 million and $27.4 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to vehicle floorplan 37 Table of Contents payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. Net of floorplan assistance, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $20.8 million and $22.8 million, respectively, change to our net inventory carrying costs. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $318.1 million and $329.7 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $3.2 million and $3.3 million change to interest expense, respectively. Hedging Risk We reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. All of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. We have a series of interest rate hedge transactions with a notional value of $800 million, consisting of a combination of swaps, and cap and floor options (collars). The hedge instruments are designed to convert certain floating rate vehicle floorplan payable and portions of our mortgage facilities to fixed rate debt. We have $200 million in swaps, which started in 2004 and effectively lock in a rate of approximately 3.0%, and $600 million in collars that cap floating rates to a maximum rate no greater than 2.4%. All of our hedge instruments mature over the next two years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, net unrealized losses, net of income taxes, related to hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss were $1.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional expense of $2.9 million and $.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. We had no outstanding derivatives during 2002. 38 Table of Contents
