ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. We have restated certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from operating activities to financing activities to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 95, Statement of Cash Flows as a result of recent comments to us from the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $(144.1) million (consisting of $(143.3) million in continuing operations and $(.8) million in discontinued operations) and $(121.2) million (consisting of $(121.3) million in continuing operations and $.1 million in discontinued operations), respectively, which were previously reported as operating activities are reported as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise (non trade lenders). This change had the 19 Table of Contents effect of increasing net cash from operating activities with the related offset in net cash from financing activities. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, we owned and operated 346 new vehicle franchises from 269 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 37 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing more than 90% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2005, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We operate in a single industry segment, automotive retailing. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing operating expenses, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management and sharing and implementing common processes across all of our stores. Historically, new vehicle sales have accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenue, but less than 30% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising less than 20% of total revenue, contribute approximately 60% of our gross margin. We believe that many factors affect industry wide sales of new and used vehicles and finance and insurance products, and retailers gross profit margins, including consumer confidence in the economy, the level of manufacturers excess production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates, the prospects of war, other international conflicts or terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, the level of personal discretionary spending, product quality, affordability and innovation, fuel prices, credit availability, unemployment rates, the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles. Our parts and service business is also impacted by these factors. In 2005, we had year over year overall same store gross profit growth driven by increases in used vehicles and parts and services. This was despite a challenging fourth quarter of 2005 which was impacted by the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores and soft industry sales. Our performance is attributable to our emphasis on store processes, associate training and expense control. In 2006, we anticipate that industry wide new vehicle sales will remain stable (nearly 17 million units) in the United States and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2006 is very difficult to predict. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had net income from continuing operations of $395.5 million and $397.1 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.48 and $1.46, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we recorded net income tax benefits in continuing operations totaling $14.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively, primarily related to resolution of various income tax matters. The results for 2005 include $10.6 million after tax ($17.4 million pre tax) of premium and deferred costs recognized as Other Interest Expense related to the repurchase of $123.1 million (face value) of our 9% senior unsecured notes. Additionally, the results for 2005 were impacted by higher floorplan interest expense primarily resulting from higher short term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory balances. The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance recognized from manufacturers) for 2005 was $3.7 million, a decrease of $31.2 million compared to 2004. We expect net floorplan costs to continue to increase in 2006 as we experience increased interest rates. During 2005 and 2004, we had income from discontinued operations totaling $101.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, net of income taxes. In 2005 and 2004, we recognized gains totaling $110.0 million and $52.2 million, respectively, included in discontinued operations related to the settlement of various income 20 Table of Contents tax matters related to items previously reported in discontinued operations. In 2005 and 2004, we also recognized losses totaling $9.0 million and $15.7 million, respectively, net of income taxes, related to stores that were sold or for which we had entered into a definitive sale agreement. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, have been adjusted to classify the results of the stores described above as discontinued operations. During 2005, we acquired 11.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $237.1 million leaving approximately $71.3 million available for share repurchases under the repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The indenture for our senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. During 2005, 9.8 million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options resulting in proceeds of $112.8 million. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible and Long Lived Assets Intangible and long lived assets are a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business. We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products and sales of parts and services. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the 21 Table of Contents related revenue is recognized. We may also participate in future profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, and for accruals related to self insurance programs, certain legal proceedings and estimated tax liabilities. 22 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 11,532.2 $ 11,664.9 $ (132.7 ) (1.1 ) $ 11,228.6 $ 436.3 3.9 Used vehicle 4,430.6 4,236.4 194.2 4.6 4,099.4 137.0 3.3 Parts and service 2,593.6 2,451.9 141.7 5.8 2,341.3 110.6 4.7 Finance and insurance, net 615.6 608.7 6.9 1.1 578.7 30.0 5.2 Other 81.4 82.7 (1.3 ) 32.1 50.6 Total revenue $ 19,253.4 $ 19,044.6 $ 208.8 1.1 $ 18,280.1 $ 764.5 4.2 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 834.6 $ 833.3 $ 1.3 .2 $ 823.8 $ 9.5 1.2 Used vehicle 428.0 395.3 32.7 8.3 387.3 8.0 2.1 Parts and service 1,137.3 1,074.4 62.9 5.9 1,022.6 51.8 5.1 Finance and insurance 615.6 608.7 6.9 1.1 578.7 30.0 5.2 Other 48.2 47.3 .9 31.2 16.1 Total gross profit 3,063.7 2,959.0 104.7 3.5 2,843.6 115.4 4.1 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,175.5 2,108.1 (67.4 ) (3.2 ) 2,043.6 (64.5 ) (3.2 ) Depreciation and amortization 80.7 81.5 0.8 67.6 (13.9 ) Other losses, net 0.5 4.0 3.5 2.9 (1.1 ) Operating income 807.0 765.4 41.6 5.4 729.5 35.9 4.9 Floorplan interest expense (110.7 ) (79.1 ) (31.6 ) (66.5 ) (12.6 ) Other interest expense (63.3 ) (76.3 ) 13.0 (71.8 ) (4.5 ) Other interest expense senior note repurchases (17.4 ) (.6 ) (16.8 ) (.6 ) Interest income 7.5 3.5 4.0 3.3 .2 Other income (expense), net (.2 ) (5.1 ) 4.9 17.0 (22.1 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 622.9 $ 607.8 $ 15.1 2.5 $ 611.5 $ (3.7 ) (.6 ) Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 391,698 402,303 (10,605 ) (2.6 ) 396,854 5,449 1.4 Used vehicle 235,313 234,598 715 .3 232,512 2,086 .9 627,011 636,901 (9,890 ) (1.6 ) 629,366 7,535 1.2 Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 29,442 $ 28,995 $ 447 1.5 $ 28,294 $ 701 2.5 Used vehicle $ 15,225 $ 14,715 $ 510 3.5 $ 14,413 $ 302 2.1 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,131 $ 2,071 $ 60 2.9 $ 2,076 $ (5 ) (.2 ) Used vehicle $ 1,809 $ 1,679 $ 130 7.7 $ 1,652 $ 27 1.6 Finance and insurance $ 982 $ 956 $ 26 2.7 $ 919 $ 37 4.0 23 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2005 % 2004 % 2003 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 59.9 61.3 61.4 Used vehicle 23.0 22.2 22.4 Parts and service 13.5 12.9 12.8 Finance and insurance, net 3.2 3.2 3.2 Other .4 .4 .2 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 27.2 28.2 29.0 Used vehicle 14.0 13.4 13.6 Parts and service 37.1 36.3 36.0 Finance and insurance 20.1 20.6 20.4 Other 1.6 1.5 1.0 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.2 7.1 7.3 Used vehicle 11.9 11.4 11.5 Parts and service 43.9 43.8 43.7 Total 15.9 15.5 15.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.3 11.1 11.2 Operating income 4.2 4.0 4.0 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 71.0 71.2 71.9 Operating income 26.3 25.9 25.7 December 31, 2005 2004 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 56 days 53 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 43 days 37 days The following table details the net floorplan benefit consisting of floorplan assistance, a component of new vehicle gross profit, and floorplan interest expense.

Same store new vehicle revenue for 2005 decreased compared to 2004 primarily as a result of a same store unit volume decrease partially offset by an increase in revenue per unit. In June 2005, General Motors announced an employee pricing for everyone program, which was followed in July 2005 with similar programs by Ford and Chrysler. Although these programs helped drive unit volume during 2005, a challenging United States auto retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores negatively impacted same store new vehicle unit volume during the fourth quarter of 2005. Despite higher gas prices, rising interest rates, and a shift in consumer preferences from trucks to crossover vehicles and cars, we expanded revenue per vehicle retailed and gross profit per vehicle retailed through our focus on pricing and profitability and management of our new vehicle inventory levels and a shift in mix from domestics to imports and luxury. New vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003 driven by increases in revenue per unit and unit volume. The increase in average revenue per unit retailed was attributable to increased dealer incentives and a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles. The increase in unit volume was attributable to the impact of acquisitions in 2004, partially offset by a decrease in same store unit volume consistent with industry trends for our brand and market mix in part due to the four major hurricanes that caused store closings and substantial disruption of our business throughout Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post 26 Table of Contents hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased during 2004 due to intense competition at the retail level and high average inventory levels during the year. At December 31, 2005, our new vehicle inventories were at $2.2 billion or 56 days supply compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.1 billion or 53 days supply at December 31, 2004. In 2006, we anticipate that new vehicle sales in the United States will remain stable (nearly 17 million units) and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2006 is very difficult to predict. The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) decreased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of increased floorplan interest expense due to higher short term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory balances. We expect net floorplan costs to continue to increase in 2006 as we experience increased interest rates. 27 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,582.6 $ 3,452.1 $ 130.5 3.8 $ 3,351.3 $ 100.8 3.0 Wholesale revenue 848.0 784.3 63.7 8.1 748.1 36.2 4.8 Total revenue $ 4,430.6 $ 4,236.4 $ 194.2 4.6 $ 4,099.4 $ 137.0 3.3 Retail gross profit $ 425.6 $ 393.8 $ 31.8 8.1 $ 384.1 $ 9.7 2.5 Wholesale gross profit 2.4 1.5 .9 3.2 (1.7 ) Total gross profit $ 428.0 $ 395.3 $ 32.7 8.3 $ 387.3 $ 8.0 2.1 Retail vehicle unit sales 235,313 234,598 715 .3 232,512 2,086 .9 Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,225 $ 14,715 $ 510 3.5 $ 14,413 $ 302 2.1 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,809 $ 1,679 $ 130 7.7 $ 1,652 $ 27 1.6 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.9 % 11.4 % 11.5 % Days supply (trailing 30 days) 43 days 37 days Same Store: Retail revenue $ 3,551.1 $ 3,450.9 $ 100.2 2.9 Wholesale revenue 831.9 780.8 51.1 6.5 Total revenue $ 4,383.0 $ 4,231.7 $ 151.3 3.6 Retail gross profit $ 422.7 $ 393.4 $ 29.3 7.4 Wholesale gross profit (.1 ) (1.2 ) 1.1 Total gross profit $ 422.6 $ 392.2 $ 30.4 7.8 Retail vehicle unit sales 233,887 234,486 (599 ) (.3 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,183 $ 14,717 $ 466 3.2 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,807 $ 1,678 $ 129 7.7 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.9 % 11.4 % Reported used vehicle performance benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance. Same store used vehicle revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to an increase in same store average revenue per vehicle retailed partially offset by a slight decrease in same store unit volume. The increase in same store average revenue per unit is the result of strengthened used vehicle market prices and the availability of quality used vehicles from trade ins. Consistent with the new vehicle unit volume decline, used vehicle unit volume was impacted by lower same store sales unit volumes resulting from a challenging United States auto retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Same store gross profit and same store gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of better inventory management focused on optimizing used vehicle inventory supply, mix and pricing. Used vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003 as a result of increases in average revenue per unit and volume. The increase in used vehicle unit volume is attributable to the impact of acquisitions in 2004 partially offset by same store unit volume declines in part due to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles and the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Gross profit for 2004 compared to 2003 increased due to acquisitions. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for 2004 increased as a result of an improved inventory mix and a strengthening used vehicle market toward the end of 2004. Used vehicle inventories were at $329.3 million or 43 days supply at December 31, 2005 compared to $290.2 million or 37 days in 2004. 28 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue $ 2,593.6 $ 2,451.9 $ 141.7 5.8 $ 2,341.3 $ 110.6 4.7 Gross profit $ 1,137.3 $ 1,074.4 $ 62.9 5.9 $ 1,022.6 $ 51.8 5.1 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.9 % 43.8 % 43.7 % Same Store: Revenue $ 2,571.1 $ 2,450.7 $ 120.4 4.9 Gross profit $ 1,126.2 $ 1,073.8 $ 52.4 4.9 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.8 % 43.8 % Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from repair orders for service labor and related parts paid directly by customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranties. Reported parts and service revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance. Despite one and a half less service days in the current year compared to prior year and the business disruption in our Florida stores due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma, same store parts and service revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer paid and warranty work as well as our parts wholesale business. Same store parts and service gross profit for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer paid and warranty work. The improvements are attributable in part to our service drive process, maintenance menus and service marketing program, as well as the continued optimization of our pricing models and training programs. Parts and service revenue and gross profit increased during 2004 due to increases in customer paid work for parts and service, attributable to the continued implementation of our service drive process, maintenance menu and service marketing program, as well as optimization of our pricing models and training programs. Parts and service was also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Results in 2004 benefited from an additional service day as compared to 2003. 29 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2003 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 615.6 $ 608.7 $ 6.9 1.1 $ 578.7 $ 30.0 5.2 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 982 $ 956 $ 26 2.7 $ 919 $ 37 4.0 Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 611.9 $ 608.7 $ 3.2 .5 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 983 $ 956 $ 27 2.8 Reported finance and insurance revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement was driven by increased retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts partially offset by decreased new and used vehicle sales, which were caused in part due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores. Improvements were also driven by our continued emphasis on training store associates. Substantially higher interest rates in the future may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased for 2004 due to increased vehicle revenue, product penetration and retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts. Additionally, our improvement has been driven by our ongoing concentration on our underperforming stores and our transparent sales process that is supported by the AutoNation Pledge. The AutoNation Pledge is our commitment to provide our customers with disclosures relating to the finance and insurance sales process. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit were also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During 2005 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67.4 million or 3.2%. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points in spite of property damage costs related to Hurricane Wilma which impacted our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Improvements are due to our continued efforts to leverage our cost structure, particularly in the areas of compensation and other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased occupancy costs. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points during 2004. Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volumes and gross margins that did not materialize through the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter, our results benefited from increased vehicle sales, as well as cost control and productivity improvements. Throughout 2004, we continued to leverage our cost structure, especially in the areas of compensation and, to a lesser extent, advertising and occupancy costs. Occupancy costs benefited from lease buy outs completed in 2004. Additionally, in September 2004, we announced a new streamlined regional structure. Non Operating Income (Expense) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $110.7 million, $79.1 million and $66.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily the result of higher short term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory levels. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily the result of higher average inventory levels and higher interest rates. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under mortgage facilities and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $63.3 million, $76.3 million and $71.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other interest expense also includes interest related to the IRS settlement (as discussed in the Provision for Income Taxes section) totaling $4.8 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which represents interest due under the agreement from the date of the settlement. The decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 of other interest expense is primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our senior unsecured notes. The increase in other interest expense for 2004 compared to 2003, excluding amounts related to the IRS settlement, is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding. Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The $12.9 million and $.5 million premium paid for this repurchase plus related deferred costs of $4.5 million and $.1 million, respectively, were recognized as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Income Statements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income in 2003 primarily relates to the sale of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. 31 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 36.5%, 34.7%, and 15.2% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. In February 2006, we made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million, primarily related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005. In March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions we entered into in 1997 and 1999. As a result of the settlement, during 2003, we recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. In 2003, we made a $366.0 million prepayment of the initial installment due March 2004, including interest. Additionally, in 2004, we prepaid the remaining balance due related to the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million, including accrued interest. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $14.5 million, $25.8 million and $140.9 million (which includes $127.5 million recognized as a result of the IRS settlement discussed above), respectively, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. In 2005 and 2004, we also recognized gains totaling $110.0 million and $52.2 million, respectively, included in Discontinued Operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters. A federal income tax audit for 2002 through 2004 is being conducted by the IRS. In addition, we are routinely audited by the states in which we do business and remain under examination by various states. We could experience additional state and federal tax adjustments in the future as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39.5%. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Financial Condition At December 31, 2005, we had $243.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Through July 14, 2005, we had two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. There were no borrowings on these revolving credit facilities during 2005 and 2004. On July 14, 2005, we terminated these credit facilities and entered into a new five year revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600.0 million with investment grade terms, including lower credit spreads compared to the facilities it replaced. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the $600.0 million multi year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $87.6 million at December 31, 2005. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2005, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $120.3 million, including $87.6 million in letters of credit. We are not required to provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We also have $321.7 million of outstanding 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. During 2005, we repurchased $123.1 million (face value) of senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% of face value or $136.0 million. For 2005, the premium paid for this repurchase was $12.9 million plus related deferred financing costs of $4.5 million, which was recognized as Other Interest Expense in the accompanying 2005 Consolidated Income Statement. Through December 31, 2005, cumulative repurchases of senior unsecured notes, which began during the fourth quarter of 2004, totaled $126.5 million (face value). The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Our senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility and mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur 32 Table of Contents additional indebtedness or repay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes places significant restrictions on our ability to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases) and investments. The revolving credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial ratios including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum consolidated cash flow leverage ratio and a maximum capitalization ratio. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, and the mortgage facility contains both maximum cash flow leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants. In the event that we were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility or mortgage facilities and such default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should we be in violation of the financial covenants, we could be limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes, vehicle floorplan payable facilities and mortgage facilities have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants. The credit spread for the revolving credit facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings. During 2005, we repaid $164.4 million of the outstanding balance under mortgage facilities with certain automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries, which includes prepayments totaling $154.0 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $153.7 million outstanding under a mortgage facility. The facility bears interest at LIBOR based interest rates (5.2% and 3.5% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively) and is secured by mortgages on certain of our stores properties. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $2.4 billion for both years. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $104.0 million and $80.0 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represents amounts payable borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with non trade lenders. All the Companys floorplan facilities are at LIBOR based rates of interest (4.8% and 3.0% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively). Secured floorplan facilities are used to finance new vehicle inventories and the amounts outstanding thereunder are due on demand, but are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by new vehicle inventories and related receivables. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the floorplan facilities so that the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of inventory. The floorplan facilities contain certain financial and operational covenants. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with such covenants in all material respects. At December 31, 2005, aggregate capacity under the floorplan credit facilities to finance new vehicles was approximately $3.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion total was outstanding. We sell and receive commissions on the following types of vehicle protection and other products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection, credit insurance, lease wear and tear insurance and theft protection products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements with these third party finance and vehicle protection product providers, we primarily sell the products on a straight commission basis; however, we may sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Through 2002, we assumed some of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2003, we have not reinsured any new extended warranties or credit insurance products. We maintain restricted cash in trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our captive insurance subsidiaries. During 2005, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $237.1 million leaving $71.3 million authorized for share repurchases. Repur 33 Table of Contents chases are made pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Future share repurchases are also subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes. On June 30, 2000, we completed the tax free spin off of ANC Rental Corporation (ANC Rental), which operated our former rental business. In connection with the spin off, we agreed to provide certain guarantees on behalf of ANC Rental. In 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In 2003, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement among AutoNation, ANC Rental and the Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we continued to guarantee $29.5 million, and committed to guarantee up to an additional $10.5 million, in surety bonds supporting obligations of the Rental Business until December 2006. In 2004, we were released from our $29.5 million guarantee obligation and our remaining $10.5 million surety bond guarantee obligations. This triggered an obligation under the Settlement Agreement for us to pay $20 million (one half of the permanent reduction of the surety bond guarantee obligations) to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy, which payment was made in 2004. We had previously incurred a pre tax charge of $20.0 million ($12.3 million after tax) for this liability included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements during 2003. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Other tax accruals totaled $54.5 million and $181.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and relate to various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters. We completed the federal income tax audit for the years 1997 through 2001 and a federal income tax audit for 2002 through 2004 is being conducted by the IRS. We remain under examination by various states. We could experience additional state and federal tax adjustments in the future as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 39.5%. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $135.6 million, $(66.9) million and $(8.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. We have revised our 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations. We had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis. We have restated certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from operating activities to financing activities to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 95, Statement of Cash Flows, as a result of recent comments to us from the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $(144.1) million (consisting of $(143.3) million in continuing operations and $(.8) million in discontinued operations) and $(121.2) million (consisting of $(121.3) million in continuing operations and $.1 million in discontinued operations), respectively, which were previously reported as operating activities are reported as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise (non trade lenders). This change had the effect of increasing net cash from operating activities with the related offset in net cash from financing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $579.9 million, $563.6 million and $481.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 34 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in vehicle floorplan payable trade (vehicle floorplan payables with the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary for the related franchise), which directly relates to changes in new vehicle inventory for those franchises. Additionally, we paid portions of the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million and $366.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing the entire balance of the amount due under the settlement. In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our stores, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. In July 2003, we sold all of our finance receivables portfolio for proceeds totaling $52.4 million, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. Collections of installment loans receivable and other items related to the wind down of this business totaled $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash used in discontinued operations was $4.3 million, $22.6 million and $1.2 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A portion of the cash used in 2005 and 2004 and all of the cash used in 2003 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $131.5 million, $132.9 million and $122.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect 2006 capital expenditures of approximately $130 million, excluding any acquisition related spending or lease buy outs. Property operating lease buy outs were $10.3 million, $77.7 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We continue to analyze certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale were $33.4 million, $37.9 million and $23.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastores and other properties held for sale. Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $15.9 million, $197.9 million and $48.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, we acquired two automotive retail franchises and other related assets. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003 includes $9.9 million, $3.3 million and $3.2 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion in Note 15, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2003, we sold all of our interest in an equity method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $16.5 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity and changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade. We have repurchased approximately 11.8 million, 14.1 million and 39.2 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for an aggregate price of $237.1 million, $236.8 million, and $575.2 million, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchase programs. 35 Table of Contents During 2005, we repaid $164.4 million of amounts outstanding under our mortgage facilities, including prepayments totaling $154.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we drew amounts totaling $183.6 million under our mortgage facilities. Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling $24.0 million, $(143.3) million and $(121.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $112.8 million, $94.2 million and $118.1 million, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Other cash used in financing activities totaled $7.8 million in 2003 and primarily includes upfront premium amounts paid in conjunction with interest rate hedge transactions. Liquidity In July 2005, we terminated our existing credit facilities with aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million, and entered into a new five year revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our secured floorplan facilities (for new vehicles) and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements, pay our tax obligations, commitments and contingencies and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We do not foresee any difficulty in continuing to comply with covenants of our various financing facilities. At December 31, 2005, we have available capacity under our revolving credit facility and available cash totaling approximately $750 million, net of outstanding letters of credit. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2005 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total one Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 2,540.0 $ 2,540.0 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 7)* 525.0 40.6 425.8 58.6 Operating lease commitments (Note 8)* 470.5 57.7 100.2 74.7 237.9 Acquisition purchase price commitments 1.0 1.0 Purchase obligations 116.6 39.1 34.0 27.5 16.0 Total $ 3,653.1 $ 2,678.4 $ 560.0 $ 160.8 $ 253.9 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2005, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $120.3 million, including $87.6 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part 36 Table of Contents of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed under the heading Financial Condition, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. In March 2006, we acquired a Mercedes Benz dealership in Pompano Beach, Florida. We also signed a separate agreement in January 2006 to acquire certain rights to establish a new Mercedes Benz dealership in Palm Beach County, Florida. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events, and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision of SFAS 123. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding its interpretation of SFAS 123R. The standard requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. In accordance with the revised statement, we will begin to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to December 31, 2005 using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. We will continue using the Black Scholes valuation model and straight line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. Based on an estimate of unvested stock options that have been issued through December 31, 2005, and potential future option grants consistent with levels in 2005, we expect compensation expense during 2006 related to stock based awards consistent with the pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 for 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS 151 requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility, freight, handling and wasted materials to be recognized as current period expenses. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and a correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on issue EITF 05 06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. EITF 05 06 requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term or that are acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured as of the date the leasehold improvements are purchased or the date of acquisition, as applicable. EITF 05 06 is effective the first reporting period beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05 06 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. FSP No. FAS 13 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive programs of vehicle manufacturers. Adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws, regulation and scrutiny. If we are found to be in 38 Table of Contents violation of any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive stores on favorable terms or at all. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payable, revolving credit facility and mortgage facility that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing interest rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, totaled $371.3 million and $494.5 million, respectively, and had a fair value of $398.5 million and $561.5 million, respectively. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt when appropriate based upon market conditions. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had variable rate vehicle floorplan payable trade and vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaling $2.5 billion for both years. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $25.4 million and $24.6 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $153.7 million and $318.1 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.5 million and $3.2 million change to interest expense, respectively. Hedging Risk We reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. All of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. We have a series of interest rate hedge transactions with a notional value of $800 million, consisting of a combination of swaps, and cap and floor options (collars). The hedge instruments are designed to convert certain floating rate vehicle floorplan payable and portions of our mortgage facilities to fixed rate debt. We have $200 million in swaps, which started in 2004 and effectively lock in a LIBOR based rate of approximately 3.0%, and $600 million in collars that cap floating rates to a maximum LIBOR based rate no greater than 2.4%. All of our hedge instruments mature between February 2006 and July 2006. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, net unrealized gains (losses), net of income taxes, related to hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) were $2.1 million and $(1.5) million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional income (expense) of $.2 million, $(2.9) million and $(.6) million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. 39
