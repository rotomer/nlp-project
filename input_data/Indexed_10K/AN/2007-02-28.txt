ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2006, we owned and operated 331 new vehicle franchises from 257 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 37 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing more than 90% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2006, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW. We operate in a single operating and reporting segment, automotive retailing. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, driving common processes and increasing productivity across all of our stores. New vehicle sales account for approximately 60% of our total revenue, but less than 30% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising less than 20% of total revenue, contribute approximately 60% of our gross margin. We believe that many factors affect sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins in the United States and in our particular geographic markets, including the economy, inflation, recession or economic slowdown, consumer confidence, housing markets, the level of manufacturers production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates, the prospects of war, other international conflicts or terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, the level of personal discretionary spending, product quality, affordability and innovation, fuel prices, credit availability, unemployment rates, the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring, and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles. Increases in interest rates could significantly impact industry new vehicle sales and vehicle affordability, due to the direct relationship between higher rates and higher monthly loan payments, a critical factor for many vehicle buyers, and the impact higher rates can have on customers borrowing capacity and disposable income. Sales of certain new vehicles, particularly larger trucks and sports utility vehicles that historically have provided us with higher gross margins, also could be impacted adversely by significant increases in fuel prices. The automotive retail environment was challenging in 2006 compared to 2005 especially in California and Florida where the housing markets experienced a significant decline. In 2006, we saw continued declines in our domestic new vehicle business and a continued revenue shift in our brand mix from domestic brands to volume import and premium luxury brands. Additionally, we saw a significant decline in non luxury truck sales, which we believe is attributable to economic issues. For 2007, we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that full year industry new vehicle sales will decline to the low 16 million unit level. However, the level of retail sales for 2007 is very difficult to predict. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had net income from continuing operations of $331.4 million and $396.9 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.45 and $1.48, respectively. Our 2006 results were positively impacted by increased gross profits in parts and service and finance and insurance, offset by lower used vehicle gross profit, higher floorplan and other interest expense and $15.2 million ($9.3 million after tax) of stock option expense related to the implementation of Statement of 20 Table of Contents Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). The results for 2006 and 2005 also include $34.5 million and $17.4 million, respectively, of premium and deferred financing costs recognized as Interest Expense related to the repurchase of our 9% senior unsecured notes. The effect on earnings per share of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the 19% reduction in shares outstanding due to the 50 million share equity tender offer completed in April 2006. Additionally, during 2005 we recorded net tax benefits in continuing operations totaling $14.5 million. In April 2006, we purchased 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer. We repurchased an additional 11.2 million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $228.9 million during the remainder of 2006, for a total of 61.2 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.38 billion in 2006. There is approximately $92.4 million available for share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our new senior notes. See further discussion under the heading Financial Condition. During 2006, 5.7 million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options, resulting in proceeds of $75.7 million. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a (loss)/income from discontinued operations totaling $(14.5) million and $99.6 million, respectively, net of income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized income of $110.0 million included in discontinued operations primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, have been adjusted to classify as discontinued operations the results of stores that were sold, that we have entered into an agreement to sell, or for which the Company otherwise deems a proposed sales transaction to be probable with no material changes expected. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long Lived Assets Goodwill, other intangible assets and long lived assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets. Our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Goodwill consists of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives. Goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill, franchise rights assets or other intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business. We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant and equipment and 21 Table of Contents assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products and sales of parts and services. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned over the life of the contracts. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for chargebacks against revenue recognized from the sale of finance, insurance and other protection products, certain assumptions related to goodwill and other intangible long lived assets and accruals related to self insurance programs, certain legal proceedings, estimated tax liabilities, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations and certain assumptions related to determining stock option compensation. 22 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Variance Variance Favorable / Favorable / ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue: New vehicle $ 11,163.0 $ 11,224.0 $ (61.0 ) (.5 ) $ 11,258.0 $ (34.0 ) (.3 ) Used vehicle 4,518.1 4,315.0 203.1 4.7 4,102.6 212.4 5.2 Parts and service 2,600.4 2,508.5 91.9 3.7 2,366.9 141.6 6.0 Finance and insurance, net 634.3 601.0 33.3 5.5 590.8 10.2 1.7 Other 72.8 81.0 (8.2 ) 82.2 (1.2 ) Total revenue $ 18,988.6 $ 18,729.5 $ 259.1 1.4 $ 18,400.5 $ 329.0 1.8 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 817.2 $ 816.7 $ .5 .1 $ 809.3 $ 7.4 .9 Used vehicle 409.1 418.8 (9.7 ) (2.3 ) 384.1 34.7 9.0 Parts and service 1,141.4 1,100.0 41.4 3.8 1,036.7 63.3 6.1 Finance and insurance 634.3 601.0 33.3 5.5 590.8 10.2 1.7 Other 42.4 47.6 (5.2 ) 46.6 1.0 Total gross profit 3,044.4 2,984.1 60.3 2.0 2,867.5 116.6 4.1 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,165.0 2,100.9 (64.1 ) (3.1 ) 2,029.8 (71.1 ) (3.5 ) Depreciation and amortization 82.9 78.4 (4.5 ) 79.2 .8 Other expenses (income), net (.1 ) .8 .9 4.0 3.2 Operating income 796.6 804.0 (7.4 ) (.9 ) 754.5 49.5 6.6 Floorplan interest expense (142.0 ) (105.5 ) (36.5 ) (74.7 ) (30.8 ) Other interest expense (90.9 ) (63.3 ) (27.6 ) (76.3 ) 13.0 Other interest expense senior note repurchases (34.5 ) (17.4 ) (17.1 ) (.6 ) (16.8 ) Interest income 8.3 7.5 .8 3.5 4.0 Other gains (losses), net 4.6 (.1 ) 4.7 (5.1 ) 5.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 542.1 $ 625.2 $ (83.1 ) (13.3 ) $ 601.3 $ 23.9 4.0 Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 369,567 381,082 (11,515 ) (3.0 ) 388,297 (7,215 ) (1.9 ) Used vehicle 225,609 228,528 (2,919 ) (1.3 ) 226,271 2,257 1.0 595,176 609,610 (14,434 ) (2.4 ) 614,568 (4,958 ) (.8 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 30,206 $ 29,453 $ 753 2.6 $ 28,993 $ 460 1.6 Used vehicle $ 16,051 $ 15,262 $ 789 5.2 $ 14,755 $ 507 3.4 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,211 $ 2,143 $ 68 3.2 $ 2,084 $ 59 2.8 Used vehicle $ 1,816 $ 1,820 $ (4 ) (.2 ) $ 1,689 $ 131 7.8 Finance and insurance $ 1,066 $ 986 $ 80 8.1 $ 961 $ 25 2.6 23 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2006 % 2005 % 2004 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 58.8 59.9 61.2 Used vehicle 23.8 23.0 22.3 Parts and service 13.7 13.4 12.9 Finance and insurance, net 3.3 3.2 3.2 Other .4 .5 .4 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 26.8 27.4 28.2 Used vehicle 13.4 14.0 13.4 Parts and service 37.5 36.9 36.2 Finance and insurance 20.8 20.1 20.6 Other 1.5 1.6 1.6 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.3 7.3 7.2 Used vehicle retail 11.3 11.9 11.4 Parts and service 43.9 43.9 43.8 Total 16.0 15.9 15.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.4 11.2 11.0 Operating income 4.2 4.3 4.1 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 71.1 70.4 70.8 Operating income 26.2 26.9 26.3 December 31, 2006 2005 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 52 days 55 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 42 days 42 days The following table details net inventory carrying benefit (cost), consisting of floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of inventory).

Same store new vehicle revenue for 2006 decreased compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, particularly in our California and Florida businesses, which is consistent with industry trends in a challenging automotive retail environment. In all our markets, we are seeing continued declines in our domestic new vehicle business, which we expect to continue in 2007. However, the level of retail sales for 2007 is very difficult to predict. In 2006, we saw a significant decline in non luxury truck sales, offset in part by stronger car sales, which we believe is consistent with industry trends. We believe these results reflect consumers reduced preference for trucks, due in large part to economic issues that included a significant decline in the California and Florida housing markets, higher interest rates and higher gas prices during portions of 2006. In 2006, we saw a continued revenue shift in our brand mix from domestic brands to volume import and premium luxury brands. In June 2005, General Motors announced an employee pricing for everyone program, which was followed in July 2005 with similar programs introduced by Ford and Chrysler. These programs, which concluded in October 2005, helped drive increases in sales volume during 2005 that were partially offset by a challenging United States retail market and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed increased as a result of the shift in our sales mix to more imports, including premium luxury brands. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained constant in 2006 compared to 2005. 26 Table of Contents New vehicle revenue for 2005 decreased compared to 2004 primarily as a result of a unit volume decrease partially offset by an increase in revenue per unit. In June 2005, General Motors announced an employee pricing for everyone program, which was followed in July 2005 with similar programs by Ford and Chrysler. Although these programs helped drive unit volume during 2005, a challenging United States automotive retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores negatively impacted new vehicle unit volume during the fourth quarter of 2005. Despite higher gas prices, rising interest rates, and a shift in consumer preferences from trucks to crossover vehicles and cars, we expanded revenue per vehicle retailed and gross profit per vehicle retailed through our focus on pricing and profitability and management of our new vehicle inventory levels and a shift in mix from domestics to imports and luxury. At December 31, 2006, our new vehicle inventories were at $1.9 billion or 52 days supply compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.1 billion or 55 days supply at December 31, 2005. The net inventory carrying cost (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) increased in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily as a result of increased floorplan interest expense due to higher short term LIBOR interest rates. 27 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Variance Variance Favorable / Favorable / ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,621.2 $ 3,487.9 $ 133.3 3.8 $ 3,338.6 $ 149.3 4.5 Wholesale revenue 896.9 827.1 69.8 8.4 764.0 63.1 8.3 Total revenue $ 4,518.1 $ 4,315.0 $ 203.1 4.7 $ 4,102.6 $ 212.4 5.2 Retail gross profit $ 409.8 $ 415.9 $ (6.1 ) (1.5 ) $ 382.2 $ 33.7 8.8 Wholesale gross profit (0.7 ) 2.9 (3.6 ) 1.9 1.0 Total gross profit $ 409.1 $ 418.8 $ (9.7 ) (2.3 ) $ 384.1 $ 34.7 9.0 Retail vehicle unit sales 225,609 228,528 (2,919 ) (1.3 ) 226,271 2,257 1.0 Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 16,051 $ 15,262 $ 789 5.2 $ 14,755 $ 507 3.4 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,816 $ 1,820 $ (4 ) (.2 ) $ 1,689 $ 131 7.8 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.3 % 11.9 % 11.4 % Days supply (trailing 30 days) 42 days 42 days Same Store: Retail revenue $ 3,595.4 $ 3,487.8 $ 107.6 3.1 Wholesale revenue 876.7 824.5 52.2 6.3 Total revenue $ 4,472.1 $ 4,312.3 $ 159.8 3.7 Retail gross profit $ 407.3 $ 415.9 $ (8.6 ) (2.1 ) Wholesale gross profit (2.7 ) .3 (3.0 ) Total gross profit $ 404.6 $ 416.2 $ (11.6 ) (2.8 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 224,980 228,528 (3,548 ) (1.6 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,981 $ 15,262 $ 719 4.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,810 $ 1,820 $ (10 ) (.5 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 11.3 % 11.9 % Reported used vehicle performance benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store retail used vehicle revenue for 2006 increased compared to 2005 primarily as a result of increased same store average revenue per unit retailed, partially offset by decreased sales volume. Same store revenue per vehicle retailed for 2006 increased due to a shift in our retail used vehicle sales mix to import luxury vehicles. Same store unit volumes and retail gross profit per vehicle for 2006 decreased as a result of a challenging automotive retail environment. Used vehicle revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to an increase in average revenue per vehicle retailed partially offset by a slight decrease in unit volume. The increase in same store average revenue per unit is the result of strengthened used vehicle market prices and the availability of quality used vehicles from trade ins. Consistent with the new vehicle unit volume decline, used vehicle unit volume was impacted by lower sales unit volumes resulting from a challenging United States automotive retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of better inventory management focused on optimizing used vehicle inventory supply, mix and pricing. Used vehicle inventories were at $306.0 million or 42 days supply at December 31, 2006 compared to $318.8 million or 42 days in 2005. 28 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Variance Variance Favorable / Favorable / ($ in millions) 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Revenue $ 2,600.4 $ 2,508.5 $ 91.9 3.7 $ 2,366.9 $ 141.6 6.0 Gross profit $ 1,141.4 $ 1,100.0 $ 41.4 3.8 $ 1,036.7 $ 63.3 6.1 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.9 % 43.9 % 43.8 % Same Store: Revenue $ 2,572.7 $ 2,508.5 $ 64.2 2.6 Gross profit $ 1,126.8 $ 1,099.9 $ 26.9 2.4 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.8 % 43.8 % Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by the customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs. Reported parts and service revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store parts and service revenue and gross profit increased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to increases in customer paid work for parts and service and wholesale parts, partially offset by a decrease in warranty business. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty and prepaid service programs. The improvements to customer paid are attributable to our service drive process, maintenance menu and service marketing program, as well as our pricing models and training programs. Additionally, during 2006 we experienced an increase in parts and service revenues and gross profit related to volume imports and premium luxury vehicles, compared to flat revenues and a decrease in gross margin related to parts and service for domestic vehicles. Despite the business disruption in our Florida stores due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma, parts and service revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer paid and warranty work as well as our parts wholesale business. Parts and service gross profit for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer paid and warranty work. The improvements are attributable in part to our service drive process, maintenance menus and service marketing program, as well as the continued optimization of our pricing models and training programs. 29 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Variance Variance Favorable / Favorable / ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2004 (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 634.3 $ 601.0 $ 33.3 5.5 $ 590.8 $ 10.2 1.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,066 $ 986 $ 80 8.1 $ 961 $ 25 2.6 Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 632.3 $ 600.5 $ 31.8 5.3 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,067 $ 985 $ 82 8.3 Reported finance and insurance revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. During 2006, same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit benefited from increased retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts, as well as higher new and used vehicle prices and increased premium luxury revenue per vehicle retailed. Improvements were also driven by our continued emphasis on training and certification of store associates, particularly in third and fourth quartile stores, and on maximizing our preferred lender relationships. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement was driven by increased retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts partially offset by decreased new and used vehicle sales, which were caused in part due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores. Improvements were also driven by our continued emphasis on training store associates. 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses During 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.1 million, or 3.1%. As a percentage of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 71.1% in 2006 from 70.4% in 2005. Increases in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 are due to an increase in compensation expense, including $15.2 million of non cash compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R for stock options during 2006 and increased advertising expenses, resulting from a decrease in advertising program participation reimbursed by manufacturers and an increase in non reimbursed advertising. In 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses included property damage costs related to Hurricane Wilma. During 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $71.1 million or 3.5%. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points in spite of property damage costs related to Hurricane Wilma which impacted our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Improvements are due to our continued efforts to leverage our cost structure, particularly in the areas of compensation and other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased occupancy costs. Non Operating Income (Expense) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $142.0 million, $105.5 million and $74.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily the result of higher short term LIBOR interest rates. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily the result of higher short term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory levels. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facility, mortgage facilities, revolving credit facility and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $90.9 million, $63.3 million and $76.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in other interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to additional debt incurred in connection with our equity tender offer in April 2006, partially offset by the repurchase of our 9% senior unsecured notes and repayments of mortgage facilities during 2006 and 2005. We expect to continue to have higher year over year interest expense during the early part of 2007. The decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 of other interest expense is primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our 9% senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense also includes interest related to the IRS settlement totaling $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 which represents interest due under the agreement from the date of the settlement. Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases In April 2006, we purchased $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying 2006 Consolidated Income Statement. During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The premium paid and financing costs of $17.4 million and $.6 million, respectively, were recognized as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Income Statements. 31 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.9%, 36.5% and 34.7% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. During 2005 and 2004, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $14.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. In 2005 and 2004, we also recognized income of $110.0 million and $52.2 million, respectively, included in Discontinued Operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters. As a matter of course, various taxing authorities, including the IRS, regularly audit us. Currently, the IRS is auditing the tax years from 2002 to 2004. These audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters. Included in Other Current Liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are $58.7 million and $54.5 million, respectively, provided by us for these matters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid 39% range on an ongoing basis, excluding the impact of any potential tax adjustments in the future. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Financial Condition At December 31, 2006, we had $52.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2006, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $124.9 million, including $92.3 million in letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2006, we also had $14.1 million of 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. The 9% senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013 and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. The floating rate senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, adjusted quarterly, and may be redeemed by us on or after April 15, 2008 at 103% of principal, on or after April 15, 2009 at 102% of principal, on or after April 15, 2010 at 101% of principal and on or after April 15, 2011 at 100% of principal. The 7% senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by us on or after April 15, 2009 at 105.25% of principal, on or after April 15, 2010 at 103.5% of principal, on or after April 15, 2011 at 101.75% of principal and on or after April 15, 2012 at 100% of principal. In connection with the issuance of the new senior unsecured notes, we amended our existing credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility that provides for various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus .80%, and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility that bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25%. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The amended credit agreement, which includes the new term loan facility, terminates on July 14, 2010 and is guaranteed by substantially all our subsidiaries. The credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $92.3 million at December 31, 2006. We had borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility of $195.0 million at December 31, 2006, leaving $412.7 million of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2006. The proceeds of the new senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity 32 Table of Contents tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium related to our debt tender offer and other financing costs was expensed during 2006. During 2006, we repaid $37.7 million of the outstanding balance under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. At December 31, 2006, we had $116.0 million outstanding under this mortgage facility, which bears interest at LIBOR based interest rates and is secured by mortgages on certain of our stores properties. We had no repurchases of our common stock during the first quarter of 2006. In April 2006, we purchased 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer. After the completion of the equity tender offer, we repurchased an additional 11.2 million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $228.9 million during the remainder of 2006, for a total of 61.2 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.38 billion in 2006. There is approximately $92.4 million available for share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors as of December 31, 2006. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our new senior notes. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the future, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock, the potential impact on our capital structure and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as strategic store acquisitions and capital investments in our current businesses. Our new senior notes, amended credit agreement and mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us. See Note 7, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial and operating covenants. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements would be impacted. In addition, availability under the revolving credit facility described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured credit ratings occur. Certain covenants in the indenture for the new senior notes would be eliminated with certain upgrades of the new senior notes to investment grade by either Standard and Poors or Moodys Investor Service. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $233.9 million and $102.2 million, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and represents amounts payable borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with non trade lenders. All the floorplan facilities are at LIBOR based rates of interest. Secured floorplan facilities are used to finance new vehicle inventories and the amounts outstanding thereunder are due on demand, but are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by new vehicle inventories and related receivables. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the floorplan facilities so that the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of inventory. The floorplan facilities contain certain operational covenants. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with such covenants in all material respects. At December 31, 2006, aggregate capacity under the floorplan credit facilities to finance new vehicles was approximately $3.6 billion, of which $2.3 billion total was outstanding. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $(193.5) million, $134.9 million and $(68.5) million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. 33 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $299.1 million, $579.8 million and $562.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in vehicle floorplan payable trade (vehicle floorplan payables with the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary for the related franchise), which directly relates to changes in new vehicle inventory for those franchises. On November 30, 2006, General Motors (GM) completed the sale of a majority stake in General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which was GMs wholly owned captive finance subsidiary prior to this transaction. GMAC will remain the exclusive provider of GM sponsored auto finance programs and is expected to continue to provide GM dealers and their customers with the same financial products and services under the same arrangements with us as before the sale. However, as a result of this sale, we have treated new vehicles financed after the change in GMAC ownership control (totaling $139.3 million at December 31, 2006) as vehicle floorplan non trade with related changes as financing cash flows. Vehicles financed by GMAC prior to this transaction (totaling $281.2 million at December 31, 2006) continue to be classified as floorplan trade with related changes as operating cash flows. During 2007, as we sell the vehicles financed by GMAC, the repayment of the $281.2 million classified as floorplan trade at December 31, 2006 will be reflected as a use of cash flows from operating activities. Vehicle purchases financed through GMAC in 2007 will be classified as floorplan non trade and reflected as sources of cash flows from financing activities. Payments to GMAC for purchases classified as floorplan non trade will be reflected as uses of cash flows from financing activities. In 2006, we made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling $278.3 million, including approximately $100 million related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, payment for which had been deferred as allowed for filers impacted by hurricanes in 2004. In March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions we entered into in 1997 and 1999. In 2004, we prepaid the remaining balance due related to the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million, including accrued interest. Cash used in discontinued operations was $4.5 million, $3.3 million and $23.4 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A portion of the cash used in 2006, 2005 and 2004 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $170.2 million, $130.9 million and $132.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2006, we spent $30.0 million on land purchases for future operating sites, which is included in the 2006 capital expenditures. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect 2007 capital expenditures of approximately $140.0 million, excluding any acquisition related spending, land purchased for future sites or lease buy outs. Property operating lease buy outs were $5.9 million, $10.3 million and $77.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We continue to analyze certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Proceeds from the disposal of property held for sale were $6.5 million, $33.4 million and $37.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of stores and other properties held for sale. Cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, totaled $24.0 million, $55.0 million and $19.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $166.7 million, $15.9 million and $197.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2006 and 2005, we acquired five and two 34 Table of Contents automotive retail franchises and other related assets, respectively. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $.2 million, $9.9 million and $3.3 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion in Note 15, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity and changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade. In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013 and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. In connection with the issuance of the new senior notes, we amended our existing credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility for which we had net borrowings of $195.0 million during 2006 and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The proceeds of the new senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million ($334.2 million of principal and tender premium and $5.6 million of accrued interest) pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium ($24.8 million) and other deferred financing costs ($9.7 million) related to our debt tender offer was expensed during 2006. During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. As discussed above, in April 2006, we purchased 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer. We repurchased an additional 11.2 million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $228.9 million during 2006, for a total of 61.2 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.38 billion in 2006. During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased 11.8 million and 14.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $237.1 million and $236.8 million, respectively, under our Board approved share repurchases programs. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $75.7 million, $112.8 million and $94.2 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we repaid $37.7 million and $164.4 million, respectively of amounts outstanding under our mortgage facilities, including prepayments of $154.0 million in 2005. Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling $96.9 million, $24.4 million and $(143.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A portion of the 2006 change in vehicle floorplan payable non trade relates to the reclassification of GMAC financed vehicles from floor plan trade to floorplan non trade, as a result of GMs sale of a majority stake in GMAC, effective November 30, 2006, as described above and in Note 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our secured floorplan facilities (for new vehicles) and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements, pay our tax obligations, commitments and contingencies and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We expect to remain in compliance with the covenants of our 35 Table of Contents various financing agreements. At December 31, 2006, unused availability under our revolving credit facility totaled $412.7 million. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our new senior notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2006 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 2,265.0 $ 2,265.0 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 7)* 1,571.5 13.6 125.9 832.0 600.0 Interest payments** 162.7 22.6 44.0 42.7 53.4 Operating lease commitments (Note 8)* 504.7 60.7 102.4 78.1 263.5 Acquisition purchase price commitments 4.2 4.2 Purchase obligations 148.3 69.1 44.3 34.8 .1 Total $ 4,656.4 $ 2,435.2 $ 316.6 $ 987.6 $ 917.0 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ** Represents scheduled interest payments on fixed rate senior unsecured notes. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2006, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $124.9 million, including $92.3 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed under the heading Provision for Income Taxes, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events, and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs. 36 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision of SFAS No. 123. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding its interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. The standard requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2006. As of January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and related interpretive guidance issued by the FASB and the SEC using the modified prospective transition method. Accordingly, our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. FSP No. FAS 13 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation) (EITF 06 3), which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis. Taxes within the scope of this EITF include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer, for example, sales taxes, use taxes, value added taxes, and some types of excise taxes. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 3 will not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48) to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 and do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value and applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. SAB No. 108 identifies the approach that registrants should take when evaluating the effects of unadjusted misstatements on each financial statement, the circumstances under which corrections of misstatements should result in a revision to financial statements, and disclosures related to the correction of misstatements. SAB No. 108 is effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation 37 Table of Contents Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement and these risk factors in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws, regulation and scrutiny. If we are found to be in violation of, or subject to liabilities under, any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results and prospects could suffer. Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive stores on favorable terms or at all. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan notes payable, revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility and floating rate senior unsecured notes that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility and the indentures relating to our new senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying these risks. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of the Companys variable rate debt when appropriate based on market conditions. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, totaled $360.5 million and $371.3 million, respectively, and had a fair value of $363.4 million and $398.5 million, respectively. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based upon market conditions. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had variable rate vehicle floorplan payable totaling $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Based on these amounts at December 31, 2006 and 2005, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $22.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively, change to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling $1.2 billion and $153.7 million, respectively. Based on the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $12.1 million and $1.5 million change to interest expense, respectively. Hedging Risk We have utilized interest rate derivatives to hedge portions of our variable rate debt. All of these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. During 2006, we had $800.0 million of interest rate hedge instruments mature, consisting of $200.0 million in swaps, which effectively locked in a LIBOR based rate of 3.0%, and $600.0 million in collars that capped floating rates to a maximum LIBOR based rate no greater than 2.4%. We held no derivative contracts as of December 31, 2006. We reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. At December 31, 2005, net unrealized gains related to hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss), was $2.1 million. For 2006 and 2005, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional income of $1.8 million and $.2 million, respectively. 39 Table of Contents
