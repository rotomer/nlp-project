ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2007, we owned and operated 322 new vehicle franchises from 244 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 38 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 96% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2007, are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Chrysler, Daimler, and BMW. We operate in a single operating and reporting segment, automotive retailing. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products, and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, implementing standardized processes, and increasing productivity across all of our stores. For the year ended December 31, 2007, new vehicle sales account for approximately 58% of our total revenue, but approximately 25% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 18% of total revenue, contribute approximately 61% of our gross margin. We believe that many factors affect sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins in the United States and in our particular geographic markets, including the economy, inflation, recession or economic slowdown, consumer confidence, housing markets, fuel prices, credit availability, the level of manufacturers production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates, the prospects of war, other international conflicts or terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, the level of personal discretionary spending, product quality, affordability and innovation, employment/unemployment rates, the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring, and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles. Changes in interest rates could significantly impact industry new vehicle sales and vehicle affordability, due to the direct relationship between interest rates and monthly loan payments, a critical factor for many vehicle buyers, and the impact interest rates can have on customers borrowing capacity and disposable income. Sales of certain new vehicles, particularly larger trucks and sports utility vehicles that historically have provided us with higher gross margins, also are impacted by fuel prices. The automotive retail environment was challenging in 2007, especially in California and Florida, where the housing markets experienced a significant decline. For 2008, we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that full year industry new vehicle sales will decline from the low 16 million unit level in 2007 to the mid 15 million unit level. However, actual sales may materially differ. We had net income from continuing operations of $288.0 million in 2007 and $330.8 million in 2006 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.44 in 2007 and 2006. The 2007 results included favorable tax adjustments of $12.0 million, or $.06 per share. The 2006 results included pre tax charges of $34.5 million, or $.09 per share, for the debt tender premium and other financing costs relating to our April 2006 recapitalization. Our Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase program in April 2007 and an additional $250.0 million share repurchase program in October 2007. We repurchased 33.2 million shares of 22 Table of Contents our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645.7 million (average purchase price per share of $19.43) during the year ended December 31, 2007. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes. As of January 1, 2008, we had approximately $30 million available for share repurchases and other restricted payments that are subject to these limitations. This amount will increase in future periods by 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), the net proceeds of stock option exercises, and certain other items, and decrease by the amount of future share repurchases and other restricted payments subject to these limitations. For further information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 7, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2007, 6.8 million shares of our common stock were issued upon exercise of stock options, resulting in proceeds of $96.6 million (average price per share of $14.12). We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $9.3 million in 2007 and $13.9 million in 2006, net of income taxes. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, have been adjusted to reclassify as discontinued operations the results of stores that were sold, that we have entered into an agreement to sell, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction to be probable with no material changes expected. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, and Long Lived Assets Goodwill, other intangible assets, and long lived assets are significant components of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Goodwill consists of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives. Goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill, franchise rights assets, or other intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business. The risk of goodwill and franchise rights impairment losses may increase to the extent that our market capitalization and earnings decline. A sustained decrease in our market capitalization, or a negative long term performance outlook, could cause the carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed its fair value, which may result in an impairment loss. Impairment losses could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant, and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant, and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Revenue Recognition/Reserves for Finance and Insurance Chargebacks Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, commissions from related finance and insurance products, sales of parts and services, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for unearned financing, insurance, or vehicle protection product commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers (chargebacks). Revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. Our estimate of chargebacks is based primarily on our historical chargeback experience, and is influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings and payoffs before maturity, and other factors. Income Taxes Accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to self insurance programs, certain legal proceedings, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations, and certain assumptions related to determining stock option compensation. 24 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) Variance 2005 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 10,195.6 $ 10,985.0 $ (789.4 ) (7.2 ) $ 10,995.8 $ (10.8 ) (0.1 ) Used vehicle 4,241.2 4,413.3 (172.1 ) (3.9 ) 4,206.2 207.1 4.9 Parts and service 2,592.7 2,532.6 60.1 2.4 2,439.0 93.6 3.8 Finance and insurance, net 593.7 623.1 (29.4 ) (4.7 ) 588.5 34.6 5.9 Other 68.3 72.5 (4.2 ) 80.8 (8.3 ) Total revenue $ 17,691.5 $ 18,626.5 $ (935.0 ) (5.0 ) $ 18,310.3 $ 316.2 1.7 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 720.0 $ 805.2 $ (85.2 ) (10.6 ) $ 801.9 $ 3.3 0.4 Used vehicle 358.9 400.4 (41.5 ) (10.4 ) 407.8 (7.4 ) (1.8 ) Parts and service 1,132.2 1,113.0 19.2 1.7 1,070.2 42.8 4.0 Finance and insurance 593.7 623.1 (29.4 ) (4.7 ) 588.5 34.6 5.9 Other 39.6 41.1 (1.5 ) 46.3 (5.2 ) Total gross profit 2,844.4 2,982.8 (138.4 ) (4.6 ) 2,914.7 68.1 2.3 Selling, general administrative expenses 2,046.2 2,109.9 63.7 3.0 2,043.4 (66.5 ) (3.3 ) Depreciation and amortization 91.7 81.4 (10.3 ) 76.9 (4.5 ) Other expenses (income), net 1.7 (0.2 ) (1.9 ) 0.5 0.7 Operating income 704.8 791.7 (86.9 ) (11.0 ) 793.9 (2.2 ) (0.3 ) Floorplan interest expense (133.1 ) (138.2 ) 5.1 (102.3 ) (35.9 ) Other interest expense (114.3 ) (90.9 ) (23.4 ) (63.3 ) (27.6 ) Other interest expense senior note repurchases (34.5 ) 34.5 (17.4 ) (17.1 ) Interest income 3.4 8.3 (4.9 ) 7.5 0.8 Other gains (losses), net (1.5 ) 4.8 (6.3 ) (0.1 ) 4.9 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 459.3 $ 541.2 $ (81.9 ) (15.1 ) $ 618.3 $ (77.1 ) (12.5 ) Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 328,963 362,895 (33,932 ) (9.4 ) 372,508 (9,613 ) (2.6 ) Used vehicle 206,140 219,271 (13,131 ) (6.0 ) 221,640 (2,369 ) (1.1 ) 535,103 582,166 (47,063 ) (8.1 ) 594,148 (11,982 ) (2.0 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 30,993 $ 30,270 $ 723 2.4 $ 29,518 $ 752 2.5 Used vehicle $ 16,440 $ 16,107 $ 333 2.1 $ 15,326 $ 781 5.1 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,189 $ 2,219 $ (30 ) (1.4 ) $ 2,153 $ 66 3.1 Used vehicle $ 1,741 $ 1,826 $ (85 ) (4.7 ) $ 1,825 $ 1.0 0.1 Finance and insurance $ 1,110 $ 1,070 $ 40 3.7 $ 990 $ 80 8.1 25 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, % 2007 % 2006 % 2005 Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 57.6 59.0 60.1 Used vehicle 24.0 23.7 23.0 Parts and service 14.7 13.6 13.3 Finance and insurance, net 3.4 3.3 3.2 Other 0.3 0.4 0.4 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 25.3 27.0 27.5 Used vehicle 12.6 13.4 14.0 Parts and service 39.8 37.3 36.7 Finance and insurance 20.9 20.9 20.2 Other 1.4 1.4 1.6 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 7.1 7.3 7.3 Used vehicle retail 10.6 11.3 11.9 Parts and service 43.7 43.9 43.9 Total 16.1 16.0 15.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.6 11.3 11.2 Operating income 4.0 4.3 4.3 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 71.9 70.7 70.1 Operating income 24.8 26.5 27.2 December 31, 2007 2006 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 53 days 51 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 44 days 42 days The following table details net inventory carrying benefit (cost), consisting of floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of inventory).

Same store new vehicle revenue decreased $877.3 million or 8.0% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a challenging automotive retail environment, which resulted in decreased same store unit volume, particularly in California and Florida. We believe these results were driven in part by continued weakness in the housing market. These volume decreases were partially offset by an increase in same store average revenue per unit retailed, primarily as a result of the continued shift in our brand mix to premium luxury brands, as well as higher average prices for domestic vehicles. To the extent that we continue to see weakness in the housing market, we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging in 2008. We also expect the declines in our domestic brands to continue in 2008. Additionally, the potential tightening in the automotive retail credit market may adversely impact our vehicle sales, while the reduction in interest rates is expected to have a positive impact. As a result of these conditions, we believe that full year industry new vehicle sales will decline from the low 16 million unit level in 2007 to the mid 15 million unit level in 2008. However, actual sales may materially differ. Same store new vehicle revenue decreased $173.5 million or 1.5% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, particularly in our California and Florida businesses, which was consistent with industry trends in a challenging automotive retail environment. In 2006, we saw a significant decline in non luxury truck sales, offset in part by stronger car sales. We believe these results reflected consumers reduced preference for trucks, due in large part to economic issues that included a significant decline in the California and Florida housing markets, higher interest rates, and higher gas prices during portions of 2006. In 2006, we saw a continued revenue shift in our brand mix from domestic brands to volume import and premium luxury brands. In June 2005, General Motors announced an employee pricing for everyone program, which was followed in July 2005 with similar programs introduced by Ford and Chrysler. These programs, which concluded in October 2005, helped drive increases in sales volume during 29 Table of Contents 2005 that were partially offset by a challenging United States retail market and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 1.9% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a competitive retail environment resulting in pricing pressures across all brand product lines, partially offset by the shift in our sales mix to more premium luxury brands. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed increased 2.4% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of the shift in our sales mix to more imports, including premium luxury brands. Our new vehicle inventories were $1.9 billion or 53 days supply at December 31, 2007, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.9 billion or 51 days supply at December 31, 2006. The following table details net inventory carrying benefit (cost), consisting of floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of inventory). Floorplan assistance is accounted for as a component of new vehicle gross profit. Years Ended December 31, Variance 2007 Variance 2006 2007 2006 vs. 2006 2005 vs. 2005 ($ in millions) Floorplan assistance $ 100.0 $ 108.8 $ (8.8 ) $ 106.6 $ 2.2 Floorplan interest expense (133.1 ) (138.2 ) 5.1 (102.3 ) (35.9 ) Net inventory carrying benefit (cost) $ (33.1 ) $ (29.4 ) $ (3.7 ) $ 4.3 $ (33.7 ) The net inventory carrying cost (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) increased in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a decrease in floorplan assistance due to lower new vehicle sales, partially offset by a decrease in floorplan interest expense due to lower new inventory levels. In 2008, we anticipate lower net inventory carrying cost due to lower floorplan interest rates, partially offset by decreases in floorplan assistance. The net inventory carrying cost (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) increased in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of increased floorplan interest expense due to higher short term LIBOR interest rates. 30 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,389.0 $ 3,531.7 $ (142.7 ) (4.0 ) $ 3,396.8 $ 134.9 4.0 Wholesale revenue 852.2 881.6 (29.4 ) (3.3 ) 809.4 72.2 8.9 Total revenue $ 4,241.2 $ 4,413.3 $ (172.1 ) (3.9 ) $ 4,206.2 $ 207.1 4.9 Retail gross profit $ 358.8 $ 400.4 $ (41.6 ) (10.4 ) $ 404.6 $ (4.2 ) (1.0 ) Wholesale gross profit 0.1 0.1 3.2 (3.2 ) Total gross profit $ 358.9 $ 400.4 $ (41.5 ) (10.4 ) $ 407.8 $ (7.4 ) (1.8 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 206,140 219,271 (13,131 ) (6.0 ) 221,640 (2,369 ) (1.1 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 16,440 $ 16,107 $ 333 2.1 $ 15,326 $ 781 5.1 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,741 $ 1,826 $ (85 ) (4.7 ) $ 1,825 $ 1 0.1 Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.6 % 11.3 % 11.9 % Days supply (trailing 30 days) 44 days 42 days Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Retail revenue $ 3,367.4 $ 3,531.7 $ (164.3 ) (4.7 ) $ 3,595.4 $ 3,487.8 $ 107.6 3.1 Wholesale revenue 838.3 879.2 (40.9 ) (4.7 ) 876.7 824.5 52.2 6.3 Total revenue $ 4,205.7 $ 4,410.9 $ (205.2 ) (4.7 ) $ 4,472.1 $ 4,312.3 $ 159.8 3.7 Retail gross profit $ 357.3 $ 400.5 $ (43.2 ) (10.8 ) $ 407.3 $ 415.9 $ (8.6 ) (2.1 ) Wholesale gross profit (2.1 ) (2.3 ) 0.2 (2.7 ) 0.3 (3.0 ) Total gross profit $ 355.2 $ 398.2 $ (43.0 ) (10.8 ) $ 404.6 $ 416.2 $ (11.6 ) (2.8 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 205,490 219,271 (13,781 ) (6.3 ) 224,980 228,528 (3,548 ) (1.6 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 16,387 $ 16,107 $ 280 1.7 $ 15,981 $ 15,262 $ 719 4.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,739 $ 1,827 $ (88 ) (4.8 ) $ 1,810 $ 1,820 $ (10 ) (0.5 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.6 % 11.3 % 11.3 % 11.9 % Reported used vehicle performance during 2007 benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased $164.3 million or 4.7% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in same store average revenue per unit retailed. Same store unit volume decreased as a result of a challenging retail environment, particularly in California and Florida. We also saw a decrease in used vehicle sales volumes in our domestic brand stores in our markets, driven in part by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Same store revenue per vehicle retailed during 2007 increased 1.7% as compared to 2006, due to a shift in our sales mix toward premium luxury stores. To the extent that we continue to see weakness in the 31 Table of Contents housing market, we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging in 2008. Additionally, the potential tightening in the automotive retail credit market may adversely impact our vehicle sales, while the reduction in interest rates is expected to have a positive impact. Same store retail used vehicle revenue increased $107.6 million or 3.1% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of increased same store average revenue per unit retailed, partially offset by decreased sales volume. Same store revenue per vehicle retailed during 2006 increased 4.7%, as compared to 2005, due to a shift in our retail used vehicle sales mix to import luxury vehicles. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 4.8% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost of our used vehicle inventory combined with the competitive retail market environment. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 0.5% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of a challenging automotive retail environment. Used vehicle inventories were $313.1 million or 44 days supply at December 31, 2007, compared to $299.9 million or 42 days at December 31, 2006. 32 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions) Reported: Revenue $ 2,592.7 $ 2,532.6 $ 60.1 2.4 $ 2,439.0 $ 93.6 3.8 Gross profit $ 1,132.2 $ 1,113.0 $ 19.2 1.7 $ 1,070.2 $ 42.8 4.0 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.7 % 43.9 % 43.9 % Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue $ 2,563.9 $ 2,532.5 $ 31.4 1.2 $ 2,572.7 $ 2,508.5 $ 64.2 2.6 Gross profit $ 1,116.4 $ 1,111.7 $ 4.7 0.4 $ 1,126.8 $ 1,099.9 $ 26.9 2.4 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.5 % 43.9 % 43.8 % 43.8 % Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by the customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs. Reported parts and service revenue and gross profit during 2007 benefited from the impact of acquisitions when compared to same store performance. Same store parts and service revenue increased $31.4 million or 1.2% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a $39.3 million increase in customer paid revenue for parts and service, a $19.1 million increase in wholesale parts revenue, and smaller increases in other parts and service revenues, such as service work outsourced to third parties and retail parts sales. Partially offsetting these increases was a $27.4 million decrease in warranty revenue and a $7.7 million decrease in revenues associated with the preparation of vehicles for sales. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty, prepaid service programs and lower vehicles sales volume. The improvements to customer paid business are attributable to our service drive process, maintenance menu, and service marketing program, as well as our pricing models and training programs. Additionally, during 2007 we experienced a 6.5% increase in parts and service revenues and a 5.2% increase in gross profit related to volume imports and premium luxury vehicles, compared to 1.1% decrease in revenues and a 2.4% decrease in gross profit related to parts and service for domestic vehicles. Same store parts and service revenue increased $64.2 million or 2.6% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to a $38.7 million increase in customer paid revenue for parts and service, a $17.7 million increase in wholesale parts revenue, a $10.4 million increase in revenues associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale, and smaller increases in other parts and service revenues, such as service work outsourced to third parties and retail parts sales. Partially offsetting these increases was a $23.5 million decrease in warranty revenue. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty and prepaid service programs. The improvements to customer paid business are attributable to our service drive process, maintenance menu, and service marketing program, as well as our pricing models and training programs. Additionally, during 2006 we experienced a 5.1% increase in parts and service revenues and a 6.1% increase in gross profit related to volume imports and premium luxury vehicles, compared to flat revenues and a 1.2% decrease in gross profit related to parts and service for domestic vehicles. Same store parts and service gross profit increased $4.7 million or 0.4% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of the greater percentage of gross profit from customer paid business for parts and service. Same store parts and service gross profit increased $26.9 million or 2.4% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily related to increased volume of imports and premium luxury vehicles. 33 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 593.7 $ 623.1 $ (29.4 ) (4.7 ) $ 588.5 $ 34.6 5.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,110 $ 1,070 $ 40 3.7 $ 990 $ 80 8.1 Years Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 596.5 $ 624.6 $ (28.1 ) (4.5 ) $ 632.3 $ 600.5 $ 31.8 5.3 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,119 $ 1,073 $ 46 4.3 $ 1,067 $ 985 $ 82 8.3 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased $28.1 million or 4.5% during 2007, as compared to 2006, due to lower new and used sales volumes partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Increased same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed was driven by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer and our continued emphasis on training and certification of store associates, particularly in third and fourth quartile stores, and on maximizing our preferred lender relationships. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed was impacted by a decrease in retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts of $1.4 million in 2007. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased $31.8 million or 5.3% during 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to the benefit from a $12.3 million increase in retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts, as well as higher new and used vehicle prices and increased premium luxury revenue per vehicle retailed. Improvements were also driven by our continued emphasis on training and certification of store associates, particularly in third and fourth quartile stores, and on maximizing our preferred lender relationships. 34 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses During 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $63.7 million or 3.0%. As a percentage of total gross profit, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 71.9% in 2007 from 70.7% in 2006 resulting from deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicles sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2007, as compared to 2006, decreased due to a $58.8 million decrease in compensation expense and an $8.3 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. During 2006, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $66.5 million or 3.3%. As a percentage of total gross profit, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 70.7% in 2006 from 70.1% in 2005. Increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2006, compared to 2005, are primarily due to a $49.8 million increase in compensation expense, including $15.2 million of non cash compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, for stock options during 2006. Additionally, advertising expenses increased $16.0 million, resulting from a $7.4 million increase in gross advertising expenditures and an $8.6 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturer. In 2005, selling, general, and administrative expenses included $10.5 million of property damage costs related to Hurricane Wilma. Non Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $133.1 million in 2007, $138.2 million in 2006, and $102.3 million in 2005. The decrease in 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily the result of lower inventory levels, partially offset by higher short term LIBOR interest rates during 2007. The increase in 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily the result of higher short term LIBOR interest rates. In 2008, we anticipate lower floorplan interest rates resulting from lower short term LIBOR interest rates. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facility, mortgage facility, revolving credit facility, and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $114.3 million in 2007, $90.9 million in 2006, and $63.3 million in 2005. The increase in other interest expense in 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily due to a $21.8 million increase in interest expense related to the $1.15 billion of additional debt incurred in connection with our April 2006 equity tender offer and a $6.2 million increase in interest expense related to our revolving credit facility, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases was an $8.7 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchase of our 9% senior unsecured notes and repayments of mortgage facilities. Additionally, during 2007 we incurred $2.6 million of expenses in connection with the modifications to our term loan, revolving credit facilities, and our mortgage facility. The increase in other interest expense in 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily due to a $61.6 million increase in interest expense related to the $1.15 billion of additional debt incurred in connection with our April 2006 equity tender offer, partially offset by a $32.4 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchase of our 9% senior unsecured notes and repayments of mortgage facilities during 2006 and 2005. Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases In April 2006, we purchased $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. 35 Table of Contents During 2005, we repurchased $123.1 million (face value) of our 9% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% of face value or $136.0 million. The premium paid and financing costs of $17.4 million were recognized as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 37.3% in 2007, 38.9% in 2006, and 36.5% in 2005. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. We expect our underlying tax rate to be approximately 40% on an ongoing basis, excluding the impact of any potential tax adjustments in the future. As of December 31, 2007, we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with FIN 48. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. During the twelve months beginning January 1, 2008, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $35 million to $39 million (net of tax effect) primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. During 2007, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $12.0 million related to the resolution of various income tax matters, changes in certain state tax laws, and other adjustments. During 2006, we made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling $278.3 million, including approximately $100 million related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, payment for which had been deferred as allowed for filers impacted by hurricanes in 2005. During 2005, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $14.5 million, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. We also recognized income of $110.0 million in 2005, included in discontinued operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our secured floorplan facilities (for new vehicles) and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We expect to remain in compliance with the covenants of our various financing agreements. At December 31, 2007, unused availability under our revolving credit facility was $361.2 million. At December 31, 2007, we had $32.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2007, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $111.6 million, including $78.8 million in letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. See the table at the beginning of Note 7, Notes Payable and Long Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amounts of our notes payable and long term debt as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Senior Unsecured Notes and Credit Agreement In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. The floating rate senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, adjusted quarterly, and may be redeemed by us on or after April 15, 2008, at a premium. The 7% senior unsecured notes may also be redeemed by us on or after April 15, 2009, at a premium. 36 Table of Contents In April 2006, we also completed the first amendment to our credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility that provided for various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 0.80%, and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25%. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The proceeds of the senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed during 2006. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $78.8 million at December 31, 2007. We had borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility of $260.0 million at December 31, 2007, leaving $361.2 million of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2007. In July 2007, we completed a second amendment of the credit agreement. Under the terms of the second amendment, the interest rate on the term loan facility decreased from LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 0.875% and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased from LIBOR plus 0.80% to LIBOR plus 0.725%. Additionally, the credit agreement termination date was extended from July 14, 2010, to July 18, 2012, and certain other terms and conditions were modified as a result of this amendment. We incurred $1.6 million of expenses in connection with this modification during 2007, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. The credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility and term loan facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings. On November 29, 2007, Standard and Poors Rating Services revised its outlook for AutoNation to negative from stable, indicating concerns that our results in 2008 could be pressured by lower vehicle sales, particularly in our California and Florida markets. Credit ratings could be lowered if new vehicle demand worsens significantly, threatening our earnings and cash flow, or if we increase our financial leverage through acquisitions or share repurchases. The outlook could be revised back to stable if market demand returns in the near term or if we demonstrate our ability to maintain reasonable profitability, cash flow, and leverage measures despite the ongoing revenue pressures. Other Debt At December 31, 2007, we had $14.1 million of 9% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. The 9% senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, we had $239.7 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. The mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in November 2007 to provide a fixed interest rate (5.864%) and provide financing secured by 10 year mortgages on certain of our store properties. In connection with this refinancing, in 2007 we received net proceeds of approximately $126.4 million and recorded $1.0 million of expenses, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Prior to this refinancing, the facility utilized short term LIBOR based interest rates. The facilitys interest rates averaged 6.54% for 2007 and 6.40% for 2006. Vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007, and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $459.9 million at December 31, 2007, and $221.4 million at December 31, 2006, and represents amounts payable borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with non trade lenders. All 37 Table of Contents the floorplan facilities are at one month LIBOR based rates of interest. Secured floorplan facilities are used to finance new vehicle inventories and the amounts outstanding thereunder are due on demand, but are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by new vehicle inventories and related receivables. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the floorplan facilities so that the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of inventory. Share Repurchases and Dividends During 2007, we repurchased 33.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645.7 million (average purchase price per share of $19.43). There was $196.7 million available for share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors as of December 31, 2007. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006. As of January 1, 2008, we had approximately $30 million available for share repurchases and other restricted payments that are subject to these limitations. This amount will increase in future periods by 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), the net proceeds of stock option exercises, and certain other items, and decrease by the amount of future share repurchases and other restricted payments subject to these limitations. While we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the future, the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure, and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006 restricts our ability to declare cash dividends. Restrictions and Covenants Our senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006, amended credit agreement, and mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us. These covenants may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate activity. See Note 7 for further information. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial and operating covenants. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described in Note 7 would be impacted. In addition, availability under the revolving credit facility described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured credit ratings occur. Certain covenants in the indenture for the senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006 would be eliminated with certain upgrades of the senior unsecured notes to investment grade by either Standard and Poors or Moodys Investor Service. The floorplan facilities described above contain certain operational covenants. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with such covenants in all material respects. At December 31, 2007, aggregate capacity under the floorplan credit facilities to finance new vehicles was $3.6 billion, of which $2.2 billion total was outstanding. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $20.0 million during 2007, decreased by $194.0 million during 2006, and increased by $134.6 million during 2005. The major components of these changes are discussed below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was $206.9 million, as compared to $302.7 million in 2006, and $579.6 million in 2005. 38 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was primarily affected by a change in the classification of borrowings from a floorplan lender, a reduction in tax payments, and a reduction in earnings, as further discussed below. On November 30, 2006, General Motors (GM) completed the sale of a majority stake in General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), which was GMs wholly owned captive finance subsidiary prior to this transaction. As a result of this sale, we have classified new borrowings from GMAC subsequent to this transaction as vehicle floorplan payable non trade, with related changes reflected as financing cash flows. Accordingly, net floorplan borrowings from GMAC since this transaction (totaling $231.5 million for 2007) are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, while repayments in 2007 of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction continue to be reflected as cash used by operating activities. Partially offsetting the GMAC reclassification was a $130.4 million reduction in tax payments during 2007, as compared to 2006. A portion of this reduction pertains to estimated federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million that we made in 2006, related to estimated taxes for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, payment for which had been deferred as allowed for filers affected by hurricanes in 2005. The reduction in cash provided by operating activities also reflects lower earnings in 2007, as compared to 2006. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted in 2006 by a $34.5 million adjustment to net income to reflect tender premium and other financing costs related to our April 2006 debt tender offer as a financing activity. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of the federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million made in 2006 that were related to estimated taxes for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, as discussed above. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities also reflects lower earnings in 2006 as compared to 2005. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy outs, were $157.9 million during 2007, as compared to $169.7 million in 2006, and $130.6 million in 2005. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect 2008 capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, excluding any acquisition related spending, land purchased for future sites, or lease buy outs, net of asset sales. Property operating lease buy outs were $2.3 million during 2007, as compared to $5.9 million in 2006, and $10.3 million in 2005. We continue to analyze certain higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Proceeds from the disposal of property held for sale were $8.8 million in 2007, $6.5 million in 2006, and $33.4 million in 2005. These amounts are primarily from the sales of stores and other properties held for sale. Cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, totaled $55.1 million in 2007, $24.0 million in 2006, and $55.0 million in 2005. Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $6.7 million in 2007, $166.7 million in 2006, and $15.9 million in 2005. During 2007, we acquired ten automotive retail franchises and other related assets as compared to five in 2006 and two in 2005. Cash used in business acquisitions included deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions of $0.2 million in 2006 and $9.9 million in 2005. See discussion in Note 15, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity, and changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade. We repurchased 33.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645.7 million during 2007 (average purchase price of $19.43), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2007. During 2007, proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $96.6 million (average price per share of $14.12), as compared to $75.7 million in 2006 (average price per share of $13.24), and $112.8 million in 2005 (average price per share of $11.55). During 2007, we refinanced our mortgage facility and received net proceeds of $126.4 million and paid $1.0 million of expenses. We repaid $4.0 million during 2007, $37.7 million in 2006, and $164.4 million in 2005 of amounts outstanding under our mortgage facilities, including prepayments of $154.0 million in 2005. Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling $219.8 million in 2007, $87.3 million in 2006, and $23.6 million in 2005. A portion of the change in vehicle floorplan payable non trade in 2007 and 2006 relates to the reclassification of GMAC financed vehicles from vehicle floorplan payable trade to vehicle floorplan payable non trade, as a result of GMs sale of a majority stake in GMAC, effective November 30, 2006, as described above and in Note 3, Inventory and Vehicle Floorplan Payable, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. In connection with the issuance of the April 2006 senior unsecured notes, we amended our existing credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility for which we had net borrowings of $260.0 million during 2007 and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The proceeds of the senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006 and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million ($334.2 million of principal and tender premium and $5.6 million of accrued interest) pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. During 2006, we expensed $34.5 million of tender premium ($24.8 million) and other deferred financing costs ($9.7 million) related to our debt tender offer. In 2005, we repurchased $123.1 million (face value) of our 9% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% (or $136.0 million) of face value. As discussed above, in April 2006, we purchased 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer. We repurchased an additional 11.2 million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $228.9 million during 2006, for a total of 61.2 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.38 billion in 2006. During 2005, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $237.1 million, under our Board approved share repurchases programs. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 2,181.8 $ 2,181.8 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 7)* 1,775.8 23.9 65.3 876.5 810.1 Interest payments ** 227.7 36.8 69.0 67.2 54.7 Operating lease commitments (Note 8)*** 665.2 60.6 105.8 90.7 408.1 Acquisition purchase price commitments 30.0 30.0 FIN 48 unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)* 52.1 39.0 13.1 Purchase obligations 154.8 72.4 56.5 25.8 0.1 Total $ 5,087.4 $ 2,444.5 $ 296.6 $ 1,060.2 $ 1,286.1 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ** Represents scheduled interest payments on fixed rate senior unsecured notes. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. *** Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2007, these charges totaled approximately $50 million. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2007, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $111.6 million, including $78.8 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed under the heading Provision for Income Taxes, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs. 41 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions, and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of, or subject to liabilities under, any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Our ability to grow our business may be limited by our ability to acquire automotive stores on favorable terms or at all. 42 Table of Contents We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan notes payable, revolving credit facility, term loan facility, and floating rate senior unsecured notes that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility, and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying these risks. Our largest stockholder, as a result of its voting ownership, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt when appropriate based on market conditions. At December 31, 2007, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $595.2 million and had a fair value of $578.9 million. At December 31, 2006, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, totaled $360.5 million and had a fair value of $363.4 million. Interest Rate Risk We had $2.2 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payables at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $21.8 million in 2007 and $22.1 million in 2006 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. We had $1.2 billion of other variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Based on the amounts outstanding at year end, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of $11.8 million in 2007 and $12.1 million in 2006. 43
