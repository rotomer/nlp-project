ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2008, we owned and operated 302 new vehicle franchises from 232 stores located in major metropolitan markets, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 37 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 96% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2008, are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, Daimler, BMW, and Chrysler. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, implementing standardized processes, and increasing productivity across all of our stores. As of December 31, 2008, we had three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. See Segment Results below and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our operating segments. For the year ended December 31, 2008, new vehicle sales account for approximately 55% of our total revenue, but approximately 22% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 21% of total revenue, contribute approximately 65% of our gross margin. We had a net loss from continuing operations of $1.2 billion and diluted loss per share of $6.89 in 2008, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $288.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.44 in 2007. The 2008 results were impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax), non cash franchise impairments of $146.5 million ($90.8 million after tax), a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $35 million, and a gain on senior note repurchases of $51.3 million ($31.5 million after tax). See further discussion of these items in Note 5, 7, and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2007 results included favorable tax adjustments of $12.0 million. 23 Market Challenges Our results of operations for 2008 reflected a challenging and volatile automotive retail market impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including the continued turbulence in the credit and housing markets. Volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preferences and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models, which led to supply and demand imbalances. Additionally, tight credit conditions limited the ability of some of our customers to purchase vehicles as well as finance and insurance products. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of new vehicle sales in the United States was 10.3 million. In comparison, full year U.S. industry new vehicle sales were 13.2 million in 2008 and 16.1 million in 2007. Industry analysts expect that the 2009 SAAR will be in the range of 11 million new vehicle units with weakness in the first half of the year. Based on these expectations, we believe that we will be able to manage within all financial covenants in our debt agreements. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Restrictions and Covenants below. While the domestic manufacturers have underperformed relative to their import and premium luxury competitors over the past several years, the performance gap widened in 2008, due in part to the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, which disproportionately impacted the domestic manufacturers. Recent government assistance has been provided to certain domestic manufacturers, but the future viability of some or all of the domestic manufacturers may be dependent on additional government assistance. The bankruptcy of one or more of the domestic manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, the manufacturers could attempt to terminate our floorplan financing and all or certain of our domestic franchises, we may be unable to collect accounts receivable from the manufacturers, and we may be required to incur impairment charges with respect to the inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets related to our domestic franchises. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $49.3 million in accounts receivable, $768.1 million of inventory, $721.8 million of fixed assets, and $178.3 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our domestic franchises. Additionally, there are uncertainties surrounding the potential impact of a domestic manufacturer bankruptcy, such as the impact on warranties provided to vehicle purchasers and the availability of parts and services needed to maintain and repair vehicles. As a result, the impact of such a bankruptcy on our financial condition and results of operations is not determinable at this time. See the risk factor We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. As part of our continuing response to the ongoing market challenges, in July 2008, we announced a cost reduction plan with a targeted annualized run rate savings of approximately $100 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, in response to the turmoil in the credit markets and the related impact on the automotive retail market, we expanded our cost reduction plan and implemented additional actions that enabled us to reduce our annualized costs by an additional $100 million. Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, we had reduced our costs by approximately $200 million on an annualized run rate basis. Inventory Management Our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets. We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We reduced our new vehicle inventory to 54,074 units at December 31, 2008, from 60,832 units at December 31, 2007. Although we focus on managing our inventory levels in accordance with consumer demand, we believe we must maintain a minimum level of inventory at our lower volume stores that is representative of the full line of vehicles offered by manufacturers. This may result in a higher days supply of inventory than would otherwise result if we were in a better economic environment. However, given our inventory management practices (such as managing our inventory purchases based on our sales forecasts and sharing inventory among stores within a local market), we do not believe the current business climate is likely to result in material impairment charges related to new vehicle inventory (subject to the risks noted in Market Challenges 24 above). We continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate. In general, used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $1.7 million at December 31, 2008, and $2.0 million at December 31, 2007. Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first in, first out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $6.3 million at December 31, 2008, and $5.8 million at December 31, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2008, we recorded $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax) of non cash goodwill impairment charges and $146.5 million ($90.8 million after tax) of non cash impairment charges related to franchise rights intangible assets. Despite these impairment charges, as of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements, as further discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources Restrictions and Covenants. As a result of the change in our operating segment structure described in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we were required to reassess the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned for goodwill impairment testing purposes. This reassessment resulted in a conclusion that our reporting units were comprised of three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. We are required to complete interim tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets when events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate that the assets might be impaired. We continue to face a challenging automotive retail environment and an uncertain economic environment in general. As a result of these conditions, there can be no assurance that an additional material impairment charge will not occur in a future period. We will continue to monitor events in future periods to determine if additional asset impairment testing should be performed. If we are required to apply the second step of the goodwill impairment test to the goodwill in any of our three reporting units in future periods, we believe that we could incur another significant non cash impairment charge related to goodwill, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt and other agreements. The goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine fair value of the Company overall and the fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities. Please see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the valuation methods and related estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing. The complexity of the analysis does not permit a simplistic determination of the impact of changes in assumptions. We believe that the most significant impact of a 25 change in the assumptions used in determining our goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2008, would have related to the amount of impairment associated with our domestic reporting unit, and that a relatively small change in assumptions could have resulted in two potentially different outcomes: 1) if the assumptions used (primarily regarding expected future cash flows) were slightly more favorable, we would possibly not have impaired the goodwill associated with our domestic reporting unit, or 2) if the assumptions used had been slightly less favorable, it is possible we would have concluded that most, if not all, of the goodwill associated with the domestic reporting unit would have been impaired. This discussion is not intended to address all potential outcomes that could have resulted if different assumptions had been used in determining our goodwill impairment given the number of assumptions used in determining the impairment and the degree of sensitivity in the determination of the fair value of the Company and its assets and liabilities to changes in such assumptions. We would have been in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements even if we had impaired all of the goodwill associated with our domestic reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of franchise rights primarily using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The forecasted cash flows used in the DCF model contain inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates, margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and cost of capital, for which we utilize certain market participant based assumptions, using third party industry projections, economic projections, and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that our franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business. The risk of a franchise rights impairment loss may increase to the extent that a stores earnings or projected growth rates decline. Our franchise rights, which related to 19 franchises and totaled $173.9 million at December 31, 2008, are evaluated on a franchise by franchise basis. We recorded impairment charges of $146.5 million during 2008 related to rights under certain franchise agreements. If the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to be a hypothetical 10% lower as of the valuation date of September 30, 2008, the resulting incremental charge would have been less than $17.4 million. Long Lived Assets We estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. During 2008, we recorded $7.2 million of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment, including property held for sale, to reduce the value of these assets to fair market value. These charges are recorded as a component of Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Chargeback Reserve Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, insurance, or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers (chargebacks). These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. We estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these 26 products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $61.0 million at December 31, 2008, and $62.5 million at December 31, 2007. Chargebacks are influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. A 10% change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2008, by approximately $6.1 million. See Finance and Insurance below and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Finance Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities. Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, commissions from related finance and insurance products, sales of parts and services, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. Income Taxes Accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately $35 million (net of tax effect) as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in October 2008. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to self insurance programs, certain legal proceedings, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations, and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation. 27 Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable/ % Favorable/ % 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) Variance 2006 (Unfavorable) Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Revenue: New vehicle $ 7,756.2 $ 10,014.3 $ (2,258.1 ) (22.5 ) $ 10,756.0 $ (741.7 ) (6.9 ) Used vehicle 3,364.5 4,139.9 (775.4 ) (18.7 ) 4,302.5 (162.6 ) (3.8 ) Parts and service 2,465.2 2,539.9 (74.7 ) (2.9 ) 2,476.9 63.0 2.5 Finance and insurance, net 482.6 584.3 (101.7 ) (17.4 ) 611.0 (26.7 ) (4.4 ) Other 63.4 68.1 (4.7 ) (6.9 ) 72.1 (4.0 ) (5.5 ) Total revenue $ 14,131.9 $ 17,346.5 $ (3,214.6 ) (18.5 ) $ 18,218.5 $ (872.0 ) (4.8 ) Gross profit: New vehicle $ 510.9 $ 709.1 $ (198.2 ) (28.0 ) $ 790.1 $ (81.0 ) (10.3 ) Used vehicle 278.4 352.0 (73.6 ) (20.9 ) 390.7 (38.7 ) (9.9 ) Parts and service 1,071.8 1,108.8 (37.0 ) (3.3 ) 1,088.2 20.6 1.9 Finance and insurance 482.6 584.3 (101.7 ) (17.4 ) 611.0 (26.7 ) (4.4 ) Other 35.8 39.1 (3.3 ) (8.4 ) 40.6 (1.5 ) (3.7 ) Total gross profit 2,379.5 2,793.3 (413.8 ) (14.8 ) 2,920.6 (127.3 ) (4.4 ) Selling, general, and administrative expenses 1,813.8 1,999.8 186.0 9.3 2,057.9 58.1 2.8 Depreciation and amortization 90.8 90.3 (0.5 ) 80.0 (10.3 ) Goodwill impairment 1,610.0 (1,610.0 ) Franchise rights impairment 146.5 2.2 (144.3 ) (2.2 ) Other expenses (income), net 13.2 (0.4 ) (13.6 ) (0.2 ) 0.2 Operating income (loss) (1,294.8 ) 701.4 (1,996.2 ) NM 782.9 (81.5 ) (10.4 ) Floorplan interest expense (87.4 ) (129.0 ) 41.6 (132.5 ) 3.5 Other interest expense (89.4 ) (114.1 ) 24.7 (90.8 ) (23.3 ) Other interest expense senior note repurchases (34.5 ) 34.5 Gain on senior note repurchases 51.3 51.3 Interest income 2.2 3.4 (1.2 ) 8.3 (4.9 ) Other gains (losses), net (4.6 ) (1.3 ) (3.3 ) 4.7 (6.0 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (1,422.7 ) $ 460.4 $ (1,883.1 ) NM $ 538.1 $ (77.7 ) (14.4 ) Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 255,843 322,849 (67,006 ) (20.8 ) 354,938 (32,089 ) (9.0 ) Used vehicle 181,281 201,175 (19,894 ) (9.9 ) 213,199 (12,024 ) (5.6 ) 437,124 524,024 (86,900 ) (16.6 ) 568,137 (44,113 ) (7.8 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 30,316 $ 31,019 $ (703 ) (2.3 ) $ 30,304 $ 715 2.4 Used vehicle $ 15,665 $ 16,432 $ (767 ) (4.7 ) $ 16,129 $ 303 1.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 1,997 $ 2,196 $ (199 ) (9.1 ) $ 2,226 $ (30 ) (1.3 ) Used vehicle $ 1,583 $ 1,745 $ (162 ) (9.3 ) $ 1,829 $ (84 ) (4.6 ) Finance and insurance $ 1,104 $ 1,115 $ (11 ) (1.0 ) $ 1,075 $ 40 3.7 28 Years Ended December 31, 2008(%) 2007(%) 2006(%) Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 54.9 57.7 59.0 Used vehicle 23.8 23.9 23.6 Parts and service 17.4 14.6 13.6 Finance and insurance, net 3.4 3.4 3.4 Other 0.5 0.4 0.4 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 21.5 25.4 27.1 Used vehicle 11.7 12.6 13.4 Parts and service 45.0 39.7 37.3 Finance and insurance 20.3 20.9 20.9 Other 1.5 1.4 1.3 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 6.6 7.1 7.3 Used vehicle retail 10.1 10.6 11.3 Parts and service 43.5 43.7 43.9 Total 16.8 16.1 16.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.8 11.5 11.3 Operating income (loss) NM 4.0 4.3 Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 76.2 71.6 70.5 Operating income (loss) NM 25.1 26.8 NM Not Meaningful December 31, 2008 2007 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 84 days 52 days Used vehicle (trailing 30 days) 30 days 44 days 29 The following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying cost, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory).

The Same Store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison, commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us. For example, the results for a dealership acquired in February 2007 would be included only in our same store comparison of 2008 to 2007, not in our same store comparison of 2007 to 2006. Results for a dealership that we classified as a discontinued operation in October 2008 would be removed entirely from our same store comparison of 2008 to 2007.

These decreases were primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment, particularly with respect to domestic vehicles. Results were adversely impacted by overall economic conditions, including reduced credit availability offered to consumers, particularly in the second half of 2008, the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and a decline in consumer confidence. Additionally, volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models, which led to supply and demand imbalances. The significantly higher fuel prices during most of 2008 caused a shift in consumer demand toward more fuel efficient vehicles. In addition, there was a shift in demand toward entry level premium luxury vehicles as a result of the economic conditions and premium luxury manufacturer programs launching and promoting these types of vehicles during 2008. The average revenue per vehicle retailed declined due to the relatively lower selling prices of these vehicles. We expect that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that adverse market conditions will continue into 2009. Same store new vehicle revenue decreased $877.3 million or 8.0% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a challenging automotive retail environment, which resulted in decreased same store unit volume, particularly in California and Florida. We believe these results were driven in part by continued weakness in the housing market. These volume decreases were partially offset by an increase in same store average revenue per unit retailed, primarily as a result of the continued shift in our brand mix to premium luxury brands, as well as higher average prices for domestic vehicles. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed decreased 9.3% during 2008, as compared to 2007. The decrease was driven largely by more stringent credit conditions in the automotive retail credit market and by the shift in demand to lower priced premium luxury vehicles which have lower margins. Same store gross 33 profit per vehicle retailed decreased 1.9% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a competitive retail environment resulting in pricing pressures across all brand product lines, partially offset by the shift in our sales mix to more premium luxury brands. Our new vehicle inventories were $1.6 billion or 84 days supply at December 31, 2008, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.8 billion or 52 days supply at December 31, 2007. The increase in our new vehicle inventory days supply is primarily due to lower sales during 2008. The following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying cost, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory). Floorplan assistance is accounted for as a component of new vehicle gross profit.

The net new vehicle inventory carrying cost (new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) increased $3.4 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a decrease in floorplan assistance due to lower new vehicle sales, partially offset by a decrease in floorplan interest expense due to lower new vehicle inventory levels. 34 Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable Favorable 2008 2007 / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 / (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) Reported: Retail revenue $ 2,839.7 $ 3,305.7 $ (466.0 ) (14.1 ) $ 3,438.7 $ (133.0 ) (3.9 ) Wholesale revenue 524.8 834.2 (309.4 ) (37.1 ) 863.8 (29.6 ) (3.4 ) Total revenue $ 3,364.5 $ 4,139.9 $ (775.4 ) (18.7 ) $ 4,302.5 $ (162.6 ) (3.8 ) Retail gross profit $ 286.9 $ 351.1 $ (64.2 ) (18.3 ) $ 389.9 $ (38.8 ) (10.0 ) Wholesale gross profit (8.5 ) 0.9 (9.4 ) 0.8 0.1 Total gross profit $ 278.4 $ 352.0 $ (73.6 ) (20.9 ) $ 390.7 $ (38.7 ) (9.9 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 181,281 201,175 (19,894 ) (9.9 ) 213,199 (12,024 ) (5.6 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,665 $ 16,432 $ (767 ) (4.7 ) $ 16,129 $ 303 1.9 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,583 $ 1,745 $ (162 ) (9.3 ) $ 1,829 $ (84 ) (4.6 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.1 % 10.6 % 11.3 % Days supply (trailing 30 days) 30 days 44 days Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable Favorable 2008 2007 / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2007 2006 / (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Retail revenue $ 2,819.1 $ 3,305.2 $ (486.1 ) (14.7 ) $ 3,367.4 $ 3,531.7 $ (164.3 ) (4.7 ) Wholesale revenue 517.2 832.1 (314.9 ) (37.8 ) 838.3 879.2 (40.9 ) (4.7 ) Total revenue $ 3,336.3 $ 4,137.3 $ (801.0 ) (19.4 ) $ 4,205.7 $ 4,410.9 $ (205.2 ) (4.7 ) Retail gross profit $ 284.7 $ 351.0 $ (66.3 ) (18.9 ) $ 357.3 $ 400.5 $ (43.2 ) (10.8 ) Wholesale gross profit (10.3 ) (1.1 ) (9.2 ) (2.1 ) (2.3 ) 0.2 Total gross profit $ 274.4 $ 349.9 $ (75.5 ) (21.6 ) $ 355.2 $ 398.2 $ (43.0 ) (10.8 ) Retail vehicle unit sales 180,304 201,134 (20,830 ) (10.4 ) 205,490 219,271 (13,781 ) (6.3 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 15,635 $ 16,433 $ (798 ) (4.9 ) $ 16,387 $ 16,107 $ 280 1.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,579 $ 1,745 $ (166 ) (9.5 ) $ 1,739 $ 1,827 $ (88 ) (4.8 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.1 % 10.6 % 10.6 % 11.3 % Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased $486.1 million or 14.7% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in revenue per vehicle retailed and a decrease in same store unit volume. The decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was driven by the challenging automotive retail environment, including the reduced credit availability offered to consumers, particularly in the second half of 2008, and a decline in consumer confidence. The decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was also driven in part by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales, as well as a reduction in traffic into our stores resulting from the significant decline in consumer confidence during 2008. Additionally, volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models, which led to supply and demand imbalances. The changes in consumer preference in used vehicles created market volatility, which was unprecedented in the industry. We expect that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that adverse market conditions will continue into 2009. Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased $164.3 million or 4.7% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in same 35 store average revenue per unit retailed. Same store unit volume decreased as a result of a challenging retail environment, particularly in California and Florida. We also saw a decrease in used vehicle sales volumes in our domestic brand stores in our markets, driven in part by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Same store revenue per vehicle retailed during 2007 increased 1.7% as compared to 2006, due to a shift in our sales mix toward premium luxury stores. Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed decreased 9.5% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due to more stringent credit conditions in the automotive retail credit market and increased pricing pressure as a result of a competitive retail environment. Additionally, significantly higher fuel costs during most of 2008 put increasing margin pressure on less fuel efficient trucks and sport utility vehicles, particularly during the period of peak fuel prices. Same store gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 4.8% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost of our used vehicle inventory combined with the competitive retail market environment. Used vehicle inventories were $149.6 million or 30 days supply at December 31, 2008, compared to $305.2 million or 44 days at December 31, 2007. We reduced our used vehicle inventories and days supply during 2008 to manage cash flow and to mitigate our exposure to the volatility of the used vehicle market by enabling us to react more quickly to consumer demand. 36 Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions) Reported: Revenue $ 2,465.2 $ 2,539.9 $ (74.7 ) (2.9 ) $ 2,476.9 $ 63.0 2.5 Gross profit $ 1,071.8 $ 1,108.8 $ (37.0 ) (3.3 ) $ 1,088.2 $ 20.6 1.9 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.5 % 43.7 % 43.9 % Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue $ 2,450.5 $ 2,539.7 $ (89.2 ) (3.5 ) $ 2,563.9 $ 2,532.5 $ 31.4 1.2 Gross profit $ 1,062.8 $ 1,106.4 $ (43.6 ) (3.9 ) $ 1,116.4 $ 1,111.7 $ 4.7 0.4 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.4 % 43.6 % 43.5 % 43.9 % Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by the customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs. Same store parts and service revenue decreased $89.2 million or 3.5% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a $30.8 million decrease in revenues associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale, a $20.9 million decrease in wholesale parts revenue, a $20.7 million decrease in warranty revenue, an $11.2 million decrease in revenues from service work outsourced to third parties, and a $5.8 million decrease in customer paid revenues. Additionally, during 2008 we experienced a 1.1% decrease in parts and service revenues and a 1.3% decrease in gross profit related to volume imports and premium luxury vehicles, compared to a 6.3% decrease in revenues and a 7.5% decrease in gross profit related to parts and service for domestic vehicles. The decrease in revenues associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale was primarily due to lower new and used vehicle unit sales volume. Wholesale parts sales decreased in 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty and prepaid service programs and lower vehicle sales volume. Customer paid business growth was constrained by economic pressures on consumer spending. We expect that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that adverse market conditions will continue into 2009. Same store parts and service revenue increased $31.4 million or 1.2% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a $39.3 million increase in customer paid revenue for parts and service, a $19.1 million increase in wholesale parts revenue, and smaller increases in other parts and service revenues, such as service work outsourced to third parties and retail parts sales. Partially offsetting these increases was a $27.4 million decrease in warranty revenue and a $7.7 million decrease in revenues associated with the preparation of vehicles for sales. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty and prepaid service programs and lower vehicles sales volume. The improvements to customer paid business are attributable to our service drive process, maintenance menu, and service marketing program, as well as our pricing models and training programs. Additionally, during 2007 we experienced a 3.4% increase in parts and service revenues and a 2.7% increase in gross profit related to volume imports and premium luxury vehicles, compared to a 1.1% decrease in revenues and a 2.4% decrease in gross profit related to parts and service for domestic vehicles. 37 Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 482.6 $ 584.3 $ (101.7 ) (17.4 ) $ 611.0 $ (26.7 ) (4.4 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,104 $ 1,115 $ (11 ) (1.0 ) $ 1,075 $ 40 3.7 Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2007 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 479.7 $ 584.3 $ (104.6 ) (17.9 ) $ 596.5 $ 624.6 $ (28.1 ) (4.5 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,103 $ 1,115 $ (12 ) (1.1 ) $ 1,119 $ 1,073 $ 46 4.3 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased $104.6 million or 17.9% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower new and used sales volumes. We expect that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that adverse market conditions will continue into 2009. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 1.1% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to the current unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including increased tightening in the automotive retail credit market, partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit during 2008 was negatively impacted by an increase in the rate of chargebacks as a percentage of finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. See Critical Accounting Estimates above and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding chargeback liabilities. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased $28.1 million or 4.5% during 2007, as compared to 2006, due to lower new and used sales volumes partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Increased same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed was driven by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer and our continued emphasis on training and certification of store associates, particularly in third and fourth quartile stores, and on maximizing our preferred lender relationships. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed was impacted by a decrease in retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts of $1.4 million in 2007. 38 Segment Results As discussed in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we made changes to our management approach that divided our business into three operating segments: (1) Domestic, (2) Import, and (3) Premium Luxury. This realignment had no effect on our previously reported consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In connection with this change, we have reclassified historical amounts to conform to our current segment presentation. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive services, and automotive finance and insurance products. Corporate and other is comprised of our other businesses, including collision centers, E commerce activities, and auction operations, as well as unallocated corporate overhead expenses.

The decrease in volume was more pronounced in the Domestic segment, as compared to the Import and Premium Luxury segments. As a result, the decline in revenues in the Domestic segment was much greater than the decline in the revenues of our other segments. Our Domestic stores derive a greater proportion of their revenue and earnings from sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles, and, as a result of significantly higher fuel prices during most of 2008, particularly in the third quarter, demand shifted away from those types of vehicles to smaller, more fuel efficient cars. Additionally, a reduction in the availability of favorable customer financing from the finance captives of domestic manufacturers, including the discontinuation or limitation of certain lease programs for domestic vehicles, contributed to the decline in sales volume from our Domestic stores. The decline in Domestic parts and service business was also greater in comparison to Import and Premium Luxury due to the improved quality of domestic vehicles, fewer units in operation, and lower domestic vehicle sales volume. Domestic segment income decreased $97.4 million or 47.6% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. Additionally, the disproportionate decline in revenues in the Domestic segment as compared to our other segments resulted in a much more significant deleveraging of the Domestic segments cost structure, as costs and expenses could not be reduced in proportion to the reduction in revenues. Domestic revenue decreased $747.4 million or 10.2% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Domestic segment income decreased $20.6 million or 9.2% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. Import The Import segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31, Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions) Revenue $ 5,449.9 $ 6,397.9 $ (948.0 ) (14.8 ) $ 6,577.3 $ (179.4 ) (2.7 ) Segment income $ 187.9 $ 250.0 $ (62.1 ) (24.8 ) $ 252.5 $ (2.5 ) (1.0 ) Retail new vehicle unit sales 135,464 161,232 (25,768 ) (16.0 ) 169,922 (8,690 ) (5.1 ) Import revenue decreased $948.0 million or 14.8% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Sales volume decreases in the Import segment were partially mitigated by the shift in demand toward more fuel efficient vehicles, from which our Import stores derive a greater proportion of their business, as compared to our Domestic and Premium Luxury stores. Import segment income decreased $62.1 million or 24.8% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. 40 Import revenue decreased $179.4 million or 2.7% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Import segment income decreased $2.5 million or 1.0% during 2007, as compared to 2006, due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. Premium Luxury The Premium Luxury segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31, Variance Variance Favorable/ Favorable/ 2008 2007 (Unfavorable) % Variance 2006 (Unfavorable) % Variance ($ in millions) Revenue $ 3,645.2 $ 4,272.8 $ (627.6 ) (14.7 ) $ 4,173.5 $ 99.3 2.4 Segment income $ 184.2 $ 226.2 $ (42.0 ) (18.6 ) $ 231.0 $ (4.8 ) (2.1 ) Retail new vehicle unit sales 40,226 48,068 (7,842 ) (16.3 ) 47,954 114 0.2 Premium Luxury revenue decreased $627.6 million or 14.7% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower vehicle sales and a decrease in revenue per vehicle retailed. The results for our Premium Luxury segment were adversely affected by a shift in consumer demand toward lower priced premium luxury vehicles. This shift in demand was caused by the difficult economic conditions, as well as several premium luxury manufacturers launching and promoting lower priced vehicles during 2008. Premium Luxury segment income decreased $42.0 million or 18.6% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to margin compression as a result of the shift in consumer demand toward lower priced premium luxury vehicles. Premium Luxury revenue increased $99.3 million or 2.4% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to higher vehicle sales and an increase in revenue per vehicle retailed. Premium Luxury segment income decreased $4.8 million or 2.1% during 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to margin compression. 41 Operating Expenses Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses During 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $186.0 million or 9.3%. As a percentage of total gross profit, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 76.2% in 2008 from 71.6% in 2007 resulting from deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicles sales, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives discussed in Market Challenges above. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to a $120.7 million decrease in compensation expense and a $44.6 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. During 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $58.1 million or 2.8%. As a percentage of total gross profit, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 71.6% in 2007 from 70.5% in 2006 resulting from deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicles sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to a $54.2 million decrease in compensation expense and a $7.3 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. Compensation expense for 2008 includes a $5.3 million non cash stock compensation expense adjustment as discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $87.4 million in 2008, $129.0 million in 2007, and $132.5 million in 2006. The decrease in 2008, as compared to 2007, is primarily the result of lower short term LIBOR interest rates, partially offset by higher average vehicle floorplan balances and the additional floorplan interest expense incurred in connection with the floorplan credit agreements we entered into during the second quarter of 2008 to finance a portion of our used vehicle inventory. The decrease in 2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily the result of lower inventory levels, partially offset by higher short term LIBOR interest rates during 2007. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facility, mortgage facility, revolving credit facility, and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $89.4 million in 2008, $114.1 million in 2007, and $90.8 million in 2006. The decrease in other interest expense of $24.7 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to a $14.4 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our term loan facility, a $7.9 million decrease in interest expense related to the repurchase of our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes of $232.9 million, and a $6.0 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our revolving credit facility and 9% senior unsecured notes. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility. The increase in other interest expense of $23.3 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to a $21.8 million increase in interest expense related to the $1.15 billion of additional debt incurred in connection with our April 2006 equity tender offer and a $6.2 million increase in interest expense related to our revolving credit facility, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases was an $8.7 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchase of our 9% senior unsecured notes and repayments of mortgage facilities. Additionally, during 2007 we incurred $2.6 million of expenses in connection with the modifications to our term loan, revolving credit facilities, and our mortgage facility. 42 Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases In April 2006, we repurchased $309.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed as Other Interest Expense Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Gain on Senior Note Repurchases During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. We also committed to repurchase an additional $11.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2008. We have reclassified these amounts from long term to current debt as of December 31, 2008. We will record a gain in the first quarter of 2009 of $3.0 million on the repurchase of these notes, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 13.9% in 2008, 37.3% in 2007, and 38.9% in 2006. The tax rate for 2008 reflects the fact that a significant portion of the impairment charges taken in 2008 was not deductible for income tax purposes. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. We expect our underlying tax rate to be approximately 40% on an ongoing basis, excluding the impact of any potential tax adjustments in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with FIN 48. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately $35 million (net of tax effect) as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in October 2008. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2009. During 2007, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $12.0 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters, changes in certain state tax laws, and other adjustments. During 2006, we made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling $278.3 million, including approximately $100 million related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, payment for which had been deferred as allowed for filers impacted by hurricanes in 2005. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated, that we have entered into an agreement to sell or terminate, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction or termination to be probable, with no material changes expected. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $17.7 million in 2008, $10.0 million in 2007, and $12.1 million in 2006, net of income taxes. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, have been adjusted to classify the results of these stores as discontinued operations. 43 Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and availability of borrowings under our secured floorplan facilities and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. For information regarding compliance with our covenants, refer to the discussion under the heading Restrictions and Covenants below. At December 31, 2008, we had $111.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2008, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $110.2 million, including $72.4 million in letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. See the table at the beginning of Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amounts of our notes payable and long term debt as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Senior Unsecured Notes and Amended Credit Agreement In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. The floating rate senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, adjusted quarterly, and may be redeemed by us currently at 103% of principal, on or after April 15, 2009, at 102% of principal, on or after April 15, 2010, at 101% of principal, and on or after April 15, 2011, at 100% of principal. The 7% senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by us on or after April 15, 2009, at 105.25% of principal, on or after April 15, 2010, at 103.5% of principal, on or after April 15, 2011, at 101.75% of principal, and on or after April 15, 2012, at 100% of principal. In April 2006, we also completed the first amendment to our credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility that provided for various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 0.80%, and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25%. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The proceeds of the senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. Approximately $34.5 million of tender premium and other financing costs related to our debt tender offer was expensed during 2006. In July 2007, we completed a second amendment of the credit agreement. Under the terms of the second amendment, the interest rate on the term loan facility decreased from LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 0.875% and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased from LIBOR plus 0.80% to LIBOR plus 0.725%. Additionally, the credit agreement termination date was extended from July 14, 2010, to July 18, 2012, and certain other terms and conditions were modified as a result of this amendment. We incurred $1.6 million of expenses in connection with this modification during 2007, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. We have a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $72.4 million at December 31, 2008. We had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2008, leaving $627.6 million of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, this borrowing 44 capacity was limited under the maximum consolidated leverage ratio contained in our amended credit agreement to approximately $301 million. During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, for an aggregate total consideration of $79.8 million. We also repurchased $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, for an aggregate total consideration of $102.3 million. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. This gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding $194.5 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $172.6 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. We also committed to repurchase an additional $11.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2008. We have reclassified these amounts from long term to current debt as of December 31, 2008. We will record a gain in the first quarter of 2009 of $3.0 million on the repurchase of these notes, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility and term loan facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings from Standard Poors (BB+, with negative outlook) and Moodys (Ba2, with negative outlook). For instance, under the current terms of our amended credit agreement, a one notch downgrade of our senior unsecured credit rating by either Standard Poors or Moodys would result in a 25 basis point increase in the credit spread under our term loan facility, a 20 basis point increase in the credit spread under our revolving credit facility, and a 5 basis point increase in the facility fee applicable to our revolving credit facility. Credit ratings could be lowered if new vehicle demand worsens significantly, threatening our earnings and cash flow, or if we increase our financial leverage through acquisitions or share repurchases. The outlook could be revised back to stable if market demand returns in the near term or if we demonstrate our ability to maintain reasonable profitability, cash flow, and leverage measures despite the ongoing revenue pressures. We may from time to time repurchase additional senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt will be based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. Other Debt On August 1, 2008, we repaid $14.1 million of 9% senior unsecured notes that matured on that date. At December 31, 2008, we had $233.3 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. The mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in November 2007 to provide a fixed interest rate (5.864%) and provide financing secured by 10 year mortgages on certain of our store properties. In connection with this refinancing, in 2007 we received net proceeds of approximately $126.4 million and recorded $1.0 million of expenses, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Prior to this refinancing, the facility utilized short term LIBOR based interest rates, which averaged 6.54% for 2007. Vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008, and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $453.5 million at December 31, 2008, and $440.9 million at December 31, 2007, and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders. All the floorplan facilities are at one month LIBOR based rates of interest. Floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds 45 the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables. Share Repurchases and Dividends The following table sets forth information regarding our share repurchases over the past three years: Year Ended December 31: Shares Repurchased Aggregate Purchase Price 2008 3.8 $ 54.1 2007 33.2 $ 645.7 2006 61.2 $ 1,380.6 As of December 31, 2008, $142.7 million remained available for share repurchases under the existing repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes. The decision to repurchase shares in the future will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with the financial ratios in our debt agreements), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. In 2008, in light of the economic conditions, our liquidity and capital resource strategies were focused on generating cash and paying down debt to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements. We expect that in 2009 we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash to pay down debt. See also Restrictions and Covenants below. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends. See Restrictions and Covenants below. Restrictions and Covenants Our amended credit agreement, the indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes, our vehicle floorplan payable facilities, and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to declare cash dividends, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. For example, under the amended credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, as defined (3.0 times through September 30, 2009, after which it will revert to 2.75 times). In March 2008, we amended our credit agreement to provide that non cash impairment losses associated with goodwill and intangible assets as well as certain other non cash charges would be excluded from the computation of the maximum consolidated leverage ratio. We are also required to remain in compliance with a maximum capitalization ratio (65%), as defined. In addition, the indenture for the floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes contains a debt incurrence restriction based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (2:1), and the mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage. The indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to make payments in connection with share repurchases, dividends, debt retirement, investments, and similar matters to a cumulative aggregate amount that is limited to $500.0 million plus 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture) since April 1, 2006, the net proceeds of stock option exercises, and certain other items, subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the indenture. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation. 46 During 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $1.76 billion ($1.46 billion after tax) associated with goodwill and franchise rights. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite these impairment charges, as of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements. As of December 31, 2008, under our amended credit agreement, our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.45 to 1, as defined in our credit agreement. Our capitalization ratio was adversely impacted by the impairment charges, and as of December 31, 2008, this ratio was approximately 59.7%, as defined in our credit agreement. Both the consolidated leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional floorplan indebtedness. Our liquidity and capital resource strategies are currently focused on generating cash and paying down debt to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements. To the extent that in the future we believe that we will be unable to comply with the covenants in our amended credit agreement, we will seek an amendment or waiver of our amended credit agreement, which could increase the cost of our debt. We may also consider other options, such as raising capital through an equity issuance to pay down debt, which could be dilutive to stockholders. See the risk factor Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility, and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business in Part I, Item 1A, of this Form 10 K. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the amended credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Certain covenants in the indenture for the floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with an upgrade of our senior unsecured notes to investment grade by either Standard Poors or Moodys. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $78.0 million during 2008, and decreased by $19.7 million during 2007 and $197.5 million during 2006. The major components of these changes are discussed below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was $685.4 million, as compared to $207.2 million in 2007, and $299.5 million in 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was primarily affected by a change in the classification of borrowings from a floorplan lender, and a reduction in earnings, as further discussed below. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was affected by a change in the classification of borrowings from a floorplan lender, in connection with the sale of a majority stake in General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) by General Motors (GM), which was GMs wholly owned captive finance subsidiary prior to this transaction. As a result of this sale, which occurred on November 30, 2006, we have classified new borrowings from GMAC subsequent to this transaction as vehicle floorplan non trade, with related changes reflected as financing cash flows. Accordingly, net floorplan borrowings from GMAC subsequent to this transaction are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, while repayments in 2007 of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction (totaling $305.8 million during 2007) are reflected as cash used by operating activities. During 2008, all borrowings and repayments related to GMAC were reflected as financing activities, since the repayment of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction were completed during 2007. After considering the effect of this reclassification, net cash provided by operating activities during 2008, compared to 2007, was impacted by an increase in cash provided by changes in working capital, partially offset by a reduction in earnings. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007, as compared to 2006, was also impacted by the GMAC reclassification. Net floorplan borrowings from GMAC totaled $231.5 million during 2007 and were reflected as cash provided by financing activities, while repayments in 2007 of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction continued to be reflected as cash used by operating activities. Partially offsetting the GMAC 47 reclassification was a $130.4 million reduction in tax payments during 2007, as compared to 2006. A portion of this reduction pertains to estimated federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million that we made in 2006, related to estimated taxes for the third and fourth quarter of 2005, payment for which had been deferred as allowed for filers affected by hurricanes in 2005. The reduction in cash provided by operating activities also reflects lower earnings in 2007, as compared to 2006. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted in 2006 by a $34.5 million adjustment to net income to reflect tender premium and other financing costs related to our April 2006 debt tender offer as a financing activity. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions as further described below. Capital expenditures, including property operating lease buy outs, were $117.4 million during 2008, as compared to $159.7 million in 2007, and $175.0 million in 2006. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We project that 2009 full year capital expenditures will be approximately $90 million to $95 million. Excluding acquisition related spending, land purchased for future sites, and lease buy outs, and net of related asset sales, we expect full year 2009 capital expenditures will be approximately $75 million to $80 million. Property operating lease buy outs were $20.4 million during 2008, as compared to $2.3 million in 2007, and $5.9 million in 2006. We continue to analyze certain higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment including the disposal of property held for sale were $3.3 million in 2008, $12.3 million in 2007, and $7.8 million in 2006. These amounts are primarily from the sales of stores and other properties held for sale. Cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, totaled $49.6 million in 2008, $55.1 million in 2007, and $24.0 million in 2006. Total cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $32.2 million in 2008, $6.7 million in 2007, and $166.7 million in 2006. During 2008, we acquired three automotive retail franchises and other related assets as compared to ten in 2007 and five in 2006. Cash used in business acquisitions included deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions of $0.2 million in 2006. See discussion in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity, and changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade. We repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $54.1 million during 2008 (average purchase price per share of $14.37). We repurchased 33.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $645.7 million during 2007 (average purchase price per share of $19.43), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2007. During 2008, proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $1.0 million (average exercise price per share of $10.71), as compared to $96.6 million in 2007 (average exercise price per share of $14.12), and $75.7 million in 2006 (average exercise price per share of $13.24). During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $79.8 million (including $0.8 million of accrued interest) and $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $102.3 million (including $2.5 million of accrued interest). We repaid $14.1 million of our 9% senior unsecured notes that matured on August 1, 2008. 48 We repaid $6.4 million during 2008, $4.0 million in 2007, and $37.7 million in 2006 of amounts outstanding under our mortgage facilities. During 2008, we borrowed $531.0 million and repaid $791.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, for net repayments of $260.0 million. During 2007, we borrowed $1.32 billion and repaid $1.26 billion outstanding under our revolving credit facility, for net borrowings of $65.0 million. During 2006, we borrowed $1.04 billion and repaid $844.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, for net borrowings of $195.0 million. Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling net proceeds of $3.3 million during 2008, net proceeds of $211.5 million during 2007, and net proceeds of $84.7 million during 2006. As discussed above, the repayment of $305.8 million of amounts due to GMAC prior to the sale by GM of a majority interest in GMAC were reflected as cash used by operating activities during 2007, while all repayments to GMAC were reflected as cash used by financing activities during 2008. Proceeds received and repayments made under the floorplan credit agreements we entered into during the second quarter of 2008 to finance a portion of our used vehicle inventory were reflected as cash provided by (used in) financing activities during 2008. In April 2006, we sold $300.0 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $300.0 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. In connection with the issuance of the April 2006 senior unsecured notes, we amended our existing credit agreement to provide: (1) a $675.0 million revolving credit facility for which we had no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and (2) a $600.0 million term loan facility. In December 2006, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility increased to $700.0 million under the amended credit agreement. The proceeds of the senior unsecured notes issued in April 2006 and term loan facility, together with cash on hand and borrowings of $80.0 million under the amended revolving credit facility, were used to: (1) purchase 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer, (2) purchase $309.4 million aggregate principal of our 9% senior unsecured notes for an aggregate total consideration of $339.8 million ($334.2 million of principal and tender premium and $5.6 million of accrued interest) pursuant to our debt tender offer and consent solicitation, and (3) pay related financing costs. During 2006, we expensed $34.5 million of tender premium ($24.8 million) and other deferred financing costs ($9.7 million) related to our debt tender offer. As discussed above, in April 2006, we purchased 50 million shares of our common stock at $23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.15 billion pursuant to our equity tender offer. We repurchased an additional 11.2 million shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $228.9 million during 2006, for a total of 61.2 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.38 billion in 2006. 49 Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 1,927.9 $ 1,927.9 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 7)* 1,258.9 33.3 50.8 812.1 362.7 Interest payments** 177.8 26.4 50.7 48.7 52.0 Operating lease commitments (Note 8)*** 569.3 51.9 93.8 85.8 337.8 Acquisition purchase price commitments 17.5 4.4 13.1 FIN 48 unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)* 9.3 5.4 0.6 3.3 Purchase obligations 168.5 45.5 54.8 47.4 20.8 Total $ 4,129.2 $ 2,089.4 $ 255.5 $ 994.6 $ 789.7 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ** Primarily represents scheduled interest payments on fixed rate senior unsecured notes and mortgage facilities. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. *** Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2008, these charges totaled approximately $48 million. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2008, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $110.2 million, including $72.4 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, seeks, projects, will, would, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. We intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we set forth this statement in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions. You should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions, and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. Our results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the conditions in the credit markets and the declining economic conditions in the United States. Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility, and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by and significant influence from vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. Our operations, including, without limitation, our sales of finance and insurance and vehicle protection products, are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation 51 of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our floorplan payable, revolving credit facility, term loan facility, and floating rate senior unsecured notes that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our largest stockholder, as a result of its voting ownership, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt when appropriate based on market conditions. At December 31, 2008, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $465.1 million and had a fair value of $377.8 million. At December 31, 2007, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $595.2 million and had a fair value of $578.9 million. Interest Rate Risk We had $1.9 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payables at December 31, 2008, and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $19.3 million in 2008 and $21.2 million in 2007 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. We had $0.8 billion of other variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Based on the amounts outstanding at year end, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of $7.9 million in 2008 and $11.8 million in 2007. 52
