ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, we owned and operated 246 new vehicle franchises from 203 stores located in major metropolitan markets, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 33 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 96% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2009, are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, Mercedes, BMW, and Chrysler. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, implementing standardized processes, and increasing productivity across all of our stores. As of December 31, 2009, we had three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2009, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 53% of our total revenue, but approximately 20% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 23% of total revenue, contributed approximately 67% of our gross margin. We had net income from continuing operations of $234.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in 2009, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.21 billion and a diluted loss per share of $6.82 in 2008. The 2009 results were impacted by a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $12.7 million, a net gain on asset sales and dispositions of $16.8 million ($10.4 million after tax), and a gain on senior note repurchases of $13.0 million ($8.1 million after tax). See further discussion of these items in Note 7 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2008 results were impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax), non cash franchise impairments of $127.4 million ($79.1 million after tax), a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $35 million, and a gain on senior note repurchases of $51.3 million ($31.5 million after tax). Market Conditions Our results for 2009 reflected a challenging automotive retail market impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including high economic uncertainty, low consumer confidence, high unemployment, tight credit conditions, and the decline in wealth resulting from depressed housing markets. In 2009, 10.4 million new vehicles were sold in the United States. In comparison, full year U.S. industry new vehicle sales were 13.2 million in 2008 and 16.1 million in 2007. New vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2009 benefited from the cash for clunkers program (discussed below) while the program ran in July and August 2009. Excluding the vehicles sold under cash for clunkers in the third quarter, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) improved in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the previous three quarters. While we believe that new vehicle sales will gradually improve in 2010 as compared to 2009, we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle sales will remain depressed by historical standards in 2010. In addition, we expect that the decline in new vehicle sales over the past few years, which has led to a decline in the number of recent model year vehicles in operation, our primary service base, may have an adverse impact on our parts and service business for the next several years. 21 Table of Contents Chrysler and General Motors Bankruptcies On April 30, 2009, Chrysler and several of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code). In connection with the bankruptcy, Chrysler filed, and the bankruptcy court approved, a dealer consolidation plan to close approximately 789 dealerships, including seven of our Chrysler dealerships. The bankruptcy court also approved the sale of certain Chrysler assets to a new company, Chrysler Group LLC, that will operate the reorganized Chrysler business. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler completed the sale, and under the terms approved by the bankruptcy court, the autoworkers union retirement health care trust received approximately 55% of the equity in the new company, Fiat approximately 20% (Fiats equity interest will increase in increments by up to a total of 35% in the event that certain milestones are achieved), the U.S. Treasury approximately 8%, and the government of Canada approximately 2%. Chrysler Group LLC assumed our remaining Chrysler franchise agreements under which we will continue to operate our remaining Chrysler dealerships that were not terminated in the bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2009, we had nine Chrysler dealerships. On June 1, 2009, General Motors and several of its affiliates also filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the bankruptcy, we entered into wind down agreements with General Motors pursuant to which we agreed to close four of our dealerships by October 2010 in exchange for certain wind down payments. At the same time, we entered into participation agreements under which our remaining General Motors dealerships will continue to operate as franchisees of the new General Motors formed as a result of the bankruptcy. Certain of our dealerships with multiple General Motors franchises entered into a participation agreement as to certain franchises and a wind down agreement as to other franchises (such as Pontiac, which General Motors is discontinuing as part of the bankruptcy). On July 5, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved General Motors plan to sell certain assets to a new company, General Motors Company, that will operate the reorganized General Motors business, and, on July 10, 2009, General Motors completed the sale. Under the terms approved by the bankruptcy court, the U.S. Treasury received approximately 61% of the equity in the new company, the autoworkers union retirement health care trust approximately 17%, the governments of Canada and Ontario approximately 12%, and the old General Motors bondholders approximately 10%. During the third quarter of 2009, we closed all four General Motors dealerships referenced above. As of December 31, 2009, we had 36 General Motors dealerships. The operating results of the Chrysler and General Motors dealerships that were closed in connection with the bankruptcies were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Discontinued Operations below for a discussion of estimated losses associated with the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies that we recorded in discontinued operations. Cash for Clunkers Our results of operations for 2009 were favorably impacted by the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, commonly referred to as cash for clunkers, that was enacted at the end of June 2009. Under the cash for clunkers program, which officially began in July 2009, certain new vehicle buyers who traded in less fuel efficient vehicles were eligible for a credit of up to $4,500 from the federal government. Cash for clunkers stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles, and we sold approximately 12,500 new vehicles under the program. Since new vehicles with a manufacturers suggested retail price above $45,000 did not qualify under the program, and since each new vehicle sold had to be more fuel efficient than the related trade in vehicle, cash for clunkers disproportionately benefited sales of smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, primarily in our Domestic and Import segments. Cash for clunkers officially ended on August 24, 2009. Toyota Recalls On October 5, 2009, Toyota initiated a recall for potential floor mat interference with accelerator pedals, referred to as the pedal entrapment recall, currently covering over 5 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles. On January 21, 2010, Toyota announced a recall for sticking accelerator pedals, referred to as the accelerator pedal recall, currently covering approximately 2.3 million Toyota vehicles, and, five days later, Toyota temporarily suspended sales of the eight new vehicle models covered by the accelerator pedal recall. In early February, Toyota announced that dealers can resume selling vehicles covered by the accelerator pedal recall, to the extent they perform the necessary repairs to address such recall. On February 8, 2010, Toyota announced additional recalls covering 2010 model year Prius vehicles as well as other Toyota and Lexus vehicles. We own a total of 21 Toyota and Lexus dealerships, and a substantial amount of our Toyota vehicle inventory is covered by one or more of these recalls. While we do not project a material impact on our business from the Toyota recalls based on current information, the overall impact is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 22 Table of Contents Inventory Management Our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We reduced our new vehicle inventory to 35,996 units at December 31, 2009, from 50,585 units at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, our days supply of new vehicle inventory was 54 days, as compared to 83 days at December 31, 2008. During the first half of 2009, we maintained relatively low new vehicle inventory levels in response to the economic downturn. As noted above under Market Conditions, the federal cash for clunkers program stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles during the third quarter of 2009, which impacted our supply of new vehicles. Additionally, the reduced production levels of certain automotive manufacturers during the second quarter of 2009, including the factory shut downs by General Motors and Chrysler, led to a lower supply of new vehicles in the market generally in the third quarter of 2009. During the second half of 2009, we increased our orders for new vehicles to manage our inventory in expectation of increased demand for the fourth quarter of 2009 and into 2010. We continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate. In general, used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $0.7 million at December 31, 2009, and $1.7 million at December 31, 2008. Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first in, first out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $4.4 million at December 31, 2009, and $6.3 million at December 31, 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2008, we recorded $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax) of non cash goodwill impairment charges and $146.5 million ($90.8 million after tax) of non cash impairment charges related to franchise rights. During 2009, we reclassified impairment charges related to franchise rights of $19.1 million ($11.7 million after tax) that were recorded during 2008 to Loss from Discontinued Operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the stores associated with these impairment charges were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2009. We completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill on April 30, 2009, and no goodwill impairment charges resulted from the required impairment test. The goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income valuation approach, which discounts projected free cash flows (DCF) of the reporting unit at a computed weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate. The income valuation approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include revenue growth rates and future operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. We base our cash flow forecasts on our knowledge of the automotive industry, 23 Table of Contents our recent performance, our expectations of our future performance, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We also make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. The test for goodwill impairment is a two step approach. A first step failure would have required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge. As of December 31, 2009, we allocated $155.7 million of goodwill to the Domestic reporting unit, $500.1 million to the Import reporting unit, and $469.3 million to the Premium Luxury reporting unit. A significant change in the assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting units. The fair values of the Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 7%, 23%, and 43%, respectively, as of April 30, 2009, the date of our most recent annual impairment test. The value of our Domestic reporting unit is heavily dependent on the success of the business plans for General Motors and, to a lesser extent, Chrysler. As of December 31, 2009, we would have been in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements even if we had impaired all of the goodwill associated with our Domestic reporting unit. We also completed our annual impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives as of April 30, 2009, and we recorded $1.5 million ($0.9 million, net of tax) of non cash impairment charges related to rights under an Import stores franchise agreement. Our franchise rights, which related to 20 franchises and totaled approximately $173.9 million at April 30, 2009, are evaluated for impairment on a franchise by franchise basis. If the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to be a hypothetical 10% lower as of the valuation date of April 30, 2009, the resulting incremental impairment charge would have been less than $5.0 million. We will continue to monitor events in future periods to determine if additional asset impairment testing should be performed. We continue to face a challenging automotive retail environment and an uncertain economic environment in general. As a result of these conditions, there can be no assurance that an additional material impairment charge will not occur in a future period. Long Lived Assets We estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more likely than not a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held and used are based on Level 3 inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset groups carrying amount exceeds the asset groups estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodologies described above, we recorded $0.7 million during 2009 of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment held and used in continuing operations to reduce the value of these assets to fair market value. These charges are recorded as a component of Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. When property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long lived assets or disposal groups carrying amount to fair value less 24 Table of Contents cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long lived asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2009, we had assets held for sale of $73.6 million in continuing operations and $78.2 million in discontinued operations. During 2009, we recorded net impairment charges of $1.1 million associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations, which is included in Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $22.1 million associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations, which is included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Chargeback Reserve Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, insurance, or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers (chargebacks). These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. We estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $48.7 million at December 31, 2009, and $61.0 million at December 31, 2008. Chargebacks are influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. The decline in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to lower volume of vehicle sales, partially offset by an increase in customer cancellations of finance and insurance products. A 10% change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2009, by approximately $4.9 million. See Finance and Insurance below and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Finance Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities. Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, commissions from related finance and insurance products, sales of parts and services, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition. 25 Table of Contents Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. Accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted a standard related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the elimination of a deferred tax liability of $12.7 million, which was reflected as a benefit in our tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2009. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.

The decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment, which for much of 2009 included reduced credit availability offered to consumers, the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and low consumer confidence. The cash for clunkers program discussed above in Market Conditions favorably impacted 2009 results as sales increased during the period the program occurred. Although full year 2009 new vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, new vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Revenue per new vehicle retailed benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix away from more fuel efficient vehicles that have relatively lower selling prices. The increase in revenue per new vehicle retailed was also due in part to a recovery in prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased 4.9% during 2009, as compared to 2008, due in part to a recovery in margins for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Margins also improved partially due to supply and demand imbalances as a result of reduced vehicle production levels of certain automotive manufacturers, which limited supply, and overall improving market conditions in the second half of 2009, which increased demand. While we believe that new vehicle sales will gradually improve in 2010 as compared to 2009, we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle sales will remain depressed by historical standards in 2010. 31 Table of Contents 2008 compared to 2007 Same store new vehicle revenue decreased $2.30 billion or 23.0% during 2008, as compared to 2007, as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume of 21.1% and a decrease in same store revenue per vehicle retailed of 2.4%. These decreases were primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment, particularly with respect to domestic vehicles. Results were adversely impacted by overall economic conditions, including reduced credit availability offered to consumers, particularly in the second half of 2008, the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and a decline in consumer confidence. Additionally, volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models, which led to supply and demand imbalances. The significantly higher fuel prices during most of 2008 caused a shift in consumer demand toward more fuel efficient vehicles. In addition, there was a shift in demand toward entry level premium luxury vehicles as a result of the economic conditions and premium luxury manufacturer programs launching and promoting these types of vehicles during 2008. The average revenue per vehicle retailed declined due to the relatively lower selling prices of these vehicles. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed decreased 9.3% during 2008, as compared to 2007. The decrease was driven largely by more stringent credit conditions in the automotive retail credit market and by the shift in demand to lower priced premium luxury vehicles which have lower margins. New Vehicle Inventories Our new vehicle inventories were $1.1 billion or 54 days supply at December 31, 2009, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.5 billion or 83 days supply at December 31, 2008. We reduced our new vehicle inventory to 35,996 units at December 31, 2009, from 50,585 units at December 31, 2008.

The increase in the net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit of $25.8 million during 2009 is due to a decrease in new vehicle floorplan interest expense primarily due to lower short term LIBOR interest rates and lower average vehicle floorplan payable balances, partially offset by a decrease in floorplan assistance due to lower new vehicle sales and a decrease in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. 2008 compared to 2007 The net new vehicle inventory carrying cost (new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) decreased $15.6 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily as a result of a decrease in new vehicle floorplan interest expense due to lower floorplan interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in floorplan assistance due to lower new vehicle sales and a decrease in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. 32 Table of Contents Used Vehicle ($ in millions, except pervehicle data) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Reported: Retail revenue $ 2,204.7 $ 2,653.2 $ (448.5) (16.9) $ 3,088.2 $ (435.0) (14.1) Wholesale revenue 304.1 495.7 (191.6) (38.7) 776.0 (280.3) (36.1) Total revenue $ 2,508.8 $ 3,148.9 $ (640.1) (20.3) $ 3,864.2 $ (715.3) (18.5) Retail gross profit $ 225.2 $ 270.7 $ (45.5) (16.8) $ 331.5 $ (60.8) (18.3) Wholesale gross profit 4.7 (6.8) 11.5 2.4 (9.2) Total gross profit $ 229.9 $ 263.9 $ (34.0) (12.9) $ 333.9 $ (70.0) (21.0) Retail vehicle unit sales 135,302 169,031 (33,729) (20.0) 187,886 (18,855) (10.0) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 16,295 $ 15,697 $ 598 3.8 $ 16,437 $ (740) (4.5) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,664 $ 1,601 $ 63 3.9 $ 1,764 $ (163) (9.2) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.2% 10.2% 10.7% Days supply (trailing 30 days) 41 days 30 days Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Same Store: Retail revenue $ 2,188.7 $ 2,616.5 $ (427.8) (16.4) $ 2,819.1 $ 3,305.2 $ (486.1) (14.7) Wholesale revenue 300.1 487.3 (187.2) (38.4) 517.2 832.1 (314.9) (37.8) Total revenue $ 2,488.8 $ 3,103.8 $ (615.0) (19.8) $ 3,336.3 $ 4,137.3 $ (801.0) (19.4) Retail gross profit $ 223.1 $ 266.2 $ (43.1) (16.2) $ 284.7 $ 351.0 $ (66.3) (18.9) Wholesale gross profit 4.9 (6.5) 11.4 (10.3) (1.1) (9.2) Total gross profit $ 228.0 $ 259.7 $ (31.7) (12.2) $ 274.4 $ 349.9 $ (75.5) (21.6) Retail vehicle unit sales 134,422 166,380 (31,958) (19.2) 180,304 201,134 (20,830) (10.4) Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 16,282 $ 15,726 $ 556 3.5 $ 15,635 $ 16,433 $ (798) (4.9) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,660 $ 1,600 $ 60 3.8 $ 1,579 $ 1,745 $ (166) (9.5) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 10.2% 10.2% 10.1% 10.6% 2009 compared to 2008 Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased $427.8 million or 16.4% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume partially offset by an increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. The decrease in used vehicle sales volume was driven by the challenging automotive retail environment in which we maintained relatively low levels of used vehicle inventory during most of 2009 in response to the economic downturn. Used vehicle sales volume was also constrained by the reduced credit availability offered to consumers for much of 2009. Additionally, used vehicle sales volume was adversely impacted by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Revenue per used vehicle retailed benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have higher average selling prices than domestic and import vehicles. This benefit was partially offset, however, by a decrease in the average revenue per used 33 Table of Contents vehicle retailed for premium luxury vehicles. The increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed was also due in part to a recovery in prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed increased 3.8% during 2009, as compared to 2008, as tighter inventories improved profitability per unit. Used vehicle inventory supply has been impacted by the decline in new vehicle sales, which has reduced trade in volume, as well as by customers retaining their vehicles for longer periods of time. Additionally, reduced fleet inventory has decreased the number of vehicles moving from fleet inventory to used vehicle inventory. Gross profit per used vehicle retailed also benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have higher average gross margins than domestic and import vehicles. 2008 compared to 2007 Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased $486.1 million or 14.7% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in revenue per vehicle retailed and a decrease in same store unit volume. The decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was driven by the challenging automotive retail environment, including the reduced credit availability offered to consumers, particularly in the second half of 2008, and a decline in consumer confidence. The decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was also driven in part by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales, as well as a reduction in traffic into our stores resulting from the significant decline in consumer confidence during 2008. Additionally, volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models, which led to supply and demand imbalances. The changes in consumer preference in used vehicles created market volatility, which was unprecedented in the industry. Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed decreased 9.5% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due to more stringent credit conditions in the automotive retail credit market and increased pricing pressure as a result of a competitive retail environment. Additionally, significantly higher fuel costs during most of 2008 put increasing margin pressure on less fuel efficient trucks and sport utility vehicles, particularly during the period of peak fuel prices. Used Vehicle Inventories Used vehicle inventories were $221.8 million or 41 days supply at December 31, 2009, compared to $140.1 million or 30 days at December 31, 2008. We reduced our used vehicle inventories and days supply during 2008 to manage cash flow and to mitigate our exposure to the volatility of the used vehicle market by enabling us to react more quickly to consumer demand. During the first half of 2009, we maintained relatively low levels of used vehicle inventory in response to the economic downturn. In the second half of 2009, we increased our used vehicle inventory in expectation of increased demand. 34 Table of Contents Parts and Service Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 ($ in millions) VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Reported: Revenue $ 2,137.4 $ 2,300.6 $ (163.2) (7.1) $ 2,375.7 $ (75.1) (3.2) Gross profit $ 934.7 $ 1,002.8 $ (68.1) (6.8) $ 1,037.8 $ (35.0) (3.4) Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.7% 43.6% 43.7% Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Same Store: Revenue $ 2,126.4 $ 2,266.0 $ (139.6) (6.2) $ 2,450.5 $ 2,539.7 $ (89.2) (3.5) Gross profit $ 930.0 $ 990.9 $ (60.9) (6.1) $ 1,062.8 $ 1,106.4 $ (43.6) (3.9) Gross profit as a percentage of revenue 43.7% 43.7% 43.4% 43.6% Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by the customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs. 2009 compared to 2008 During 2009, same store parts and service gross profit decreased $60.9 million or 6.1%, as compared to 2008. This decrease is primarily due to declines in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties of $22.3 million, warranty of $15.1 million, customer pay service of $14.9 million, and wholesale and retail counter parts of $5.2 million. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties was adversely impacted primarily by lower new and used vehicle sales volume. Warranty was adversely impacted by fewer vehicles in operation as a result of lower vehicle sales in recent years and, to a lesser extent, improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years. Customer pay service and wholesale and retail counter parts gross profit were also adversely impacted by fewer vehicles in operation, as well as by the difficult market conditions. We expect that the decline in new vehicle sales over the past few years, which has led to a decline in the total number of recent model year vehicles in operation, our primary service base, may have an adverse impact on our parts and service business for the next several years. 2008 compared to 2007 Same store parts and service gross profit decreased $43.6 million or 3.9% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to declines in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties of $23.8 million, warranty of $7.8 million, wholesale and retail counter parts of $5.9 million, and customer pay service of $5.2 million. The decrease in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties was primarily due to lower new and used vehicle unit sales volume. Warranty declines were driven in part by improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years, as well as changes to certain manufacturers warranty and prepaid service programs and lower vehicle sales volume. Wholesale and retail counter parts gross profit decreased in 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Customer pay service business growth was constrained by economic pressures on consumer spending. 35 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 351.2 $ 460.2 $ (109.0) (23.7) $ 555.7 $ (95.5) (17.2) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,102 $ 1,114 $ (12) (1.1) $ 1,124 $ (10) (0.9) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 349.7 $ 456.4 $ (106.7) (23.4) $ 479.7 $ 584.3 $ (104.6) (17.9) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,103 $ 1,117 $ (14) (1.3) $ 1,103 $ 1,115 $ (12) (1.1) 2009 compared to 2008 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased $106.7 million or 23.4% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower new and used sales volumes. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit during 2009 were impacted by a favorable adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 2009 of $5.2 million ($3.2 million after tax) on our reserves for expected chargebacks. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 1.3% during 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed were adversely impacted by fewer customers financing vehicles through the dealerships. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed were also adversely impacted by the current unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including lower commissions due to tightness in the automotive lending environment for much of 2009, partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer. 2008 compared to 2007 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased $104.6 million or 17.9% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower new and used sales volumes. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased 1.1% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to the current unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including increased tightening in the automotive retail credit market, partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit during 2008 were negatively impacted by an increase in the rate of chargebacks as a percentage of finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding chargeback liabilities. 36 Table of Contents Segment Results In the following table of financial data, total Segment Income (Loss) of the operating segments is reconciled to consolidated operating income (loss).

For much of 2009, a reduction in the availability of customer financing, including the discontinuation or limitation of certain lease programs for domestic vehicles, and customer uncertainty surrounding the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies contributed to the decline in sales volume from our Domestic stores. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per new vehicle retailed for domestic vehicles due to a recovery in prices for large vehicles. Prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, increased as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices in 2009. The decrease in sales volume was also partially mitigated by the sales of vehicles under the cash for clunkers program. Although full year 2009 Domestic new vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Domestic new vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Domestic segment income decreased $3.6 million or 3.3% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased revenues as a result of the competitive retail environment. Domestic segment income was also impacted by a decrease in finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed as a result of the reduction in credit availability. Domestic segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. In the second quarter of 2009, each of Chrysler and General Motors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The operating results of the Chrysler and General Motors dealerships that were closed in connection with these bankruptcies were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Market Conditions Chrysler and General Motors Bankruptcies above. 2008 compared to 2007 Domestic revenue decreased $1.47 billion or 25.3% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. The decrease in volume was more pronounced in the Domestic segment, as compared to the Import and Premium Luxury segments. As a result, the decline in revenues in the Domestic segment was much greater than the decline in the revenues of our other segments. Our Domestic stores derive a greater proportion of their revenue and earnings from sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles, and, as a result of significantly higher fuel prices during most of 2008, particularly in the third quarter, demand shifted away from those types of vehicles to smaller, more fuel efficient cars. Additionally, a reduction in the availability of favorable customer financing from the finance captives of domestic manufacturers, including the discontinuation or limitation of certain lease programs for domestic vehicles, contributed to the decline in sales volume from our Domestic stores. The decline in Domestic parts and service business was also greater in comparison to Import and Premium Luxury due to the improved quality of domestic vehicles, fewer units in operation, and lower domestic vehicle sales volume. Domestic segment income decreased $90.3 million or 45.3% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. Additionally, the disproportionate decline in revenues in the Domestic segment as compared to our other segments resulted in a much more significant deleveraging of the Domestic segments cost structure, as costs and expenses could not be reduced in proportion to the reduction in revenues. 38 Table of Contents Import The Import segment operating results included the following: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2007 VarianceFavorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue $ 4,126.0 $ 5,280.5 $ (1,154.5) (21.9) $ 6,194.6 $ (914.1) (14.8) Segment income $ 175.1 $ 184.5 $ (9.4) (5.1) $ 246.1 $ (61.6) (25.0) Retail new vehicle unit sales 98,015 132,662 (34,647) (26.1) 157,911 (25,249) (16.0) 2009 compared to 2008 Import revenue decreased $1.15 billion or 21.9% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Lower sales were partially attributable during the first half of 2009 to a decline in customer demand for import vehicles due to a shift in consumer preferences away from more fuel efficient vehicles as fuel prices decreased. The decrease in sales volume was partially mitigated by the sales of vehicles under the cash for clunkers program. Although full year 2009 Import new and used vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Import new and used vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Import segment income decreased $9.4 million or 5.1% during 2009, as compared to 2008. The decrease in segment income was driven largely by a decline in sales due to a competitive retail environment. Import segment income was also impacted by a decrease in finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed as a result of tighter credit conditions. Import segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. See Market Conditions Toyota Recalls above for information regarding recent recalls announced by Toyota. 2008 compared to 2007 Import revenue decreased $914.1 million or 14.8% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Sales volume decreases in the Import segment were partially mitigated by the shift in demand toward more fuel efficient vehicles, from which our Import stores derive a greater proportion of their business, as compared to our Domestic and Premium Luxury stores. Import segment income decreased $61.6 million or 25.0% during 2008, as compared to 2007, due to decreased revenues and increased pricing pressure as a result of the competitive retail environment. 39 Table of Contents Premium Luxury The Premium Luxury segment operating results included the following: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2007 VarianceFavorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue $ 3,073.1 $ 3,629.5 $ (556.4) (15.3) $ 4,248.9 $ (619.4) (14.6) Segment income $ 175.5 $ 183.7 $ (8.2) (4.5) $ 225.3 $ (41.6) (18.5) Retail new vehicle unit sales 31,922 40,128 (8,206) (20.4) 47,824 (7,696) (16.1) 2009 compared to 2008 Premium Luxury revenue decreased $556.4 million or 15.3% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales and a decrease in revenue per new vehicle retailed, reflecting the challenging automotive retail environment. Although full year 2009 Premium Luxury new and used vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Premium Luxury new and used vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Premium Luxury segment income decreased $8.2 million or 4.5% during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales, in addition to margin compression as a result of a decrease in the average revenue per new vehicle retailed. Premium Luxury segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. 2008 compared to 2007 Premium Luxury revenue decreased $619.4 million or 14.6% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower vehicle sales and a decrease in revenue per vehicle retailed. The results for our Premium Luxury segment were adversely affected by a shift in consumer demand toward lower priced premium luxury vehicles. This shift in demand was caused by the difficult economic conditions, as well as several premium luxury manufacturers launching and promoting lower priced vehicles during 2008. Premium Luxury segment income decreased $41.6 million or 18.5% during 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to margin compression as a result of the shift in consumer demand toward lower priced premium luxury vehicles. 40 Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 2009 compared to 2008 During 2009, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses decreased $234.0 million or 13.8%. As a percentage of total gross profit, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses increased to 75.9% in 2009 from 75.5% in 2008 resulting from a deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicle sales, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to a $140.7 million decrease in compensation expense and a $42.4 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. 2008 compared to 2007 During 2008, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses decreased $178.0 million or 9.5%. As a percentage of total gross profit, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses increased to 75.5% in 2008 from 71.0% in 2007 resulting from deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicle sales, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses decreased in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to a $114.6 million decrease in compensation expense and a $41.4 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. Compensation expense for 2008 includes a $5.3 million non cash stock based compensation expense adjustment as discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $36.1 million in 2009, $81.1 million in 2008, and $118.1 million in 2007. 2009 compared to 2008 The decrease in floorplan interest expense of $45.0 million in 2009, as compared to 2008, is primarily the result of lower short term LIBOR interest rates and lower average vehicle floorplan payable balances. 2008 compared to 2007 The decrease in floorplan interest expense of $37.0 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, is primarily the result of lower short term LIBOR interest rates, partially offset by higher average vehicle floorplan balances and the additional floorplan interest expense incurred in connection with the floorplan credit agreements we entered into during the second quarter of 2008 to finance a portion of our used vehicle inventory. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facility, mortgage facility, revolving credit facility, and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $42.6 million in 2009, $89.4 million in 2008, and $114.1 million in 2007. 2009 compared to 2008 The decrease in other interest expense of $46.8 million in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a $20.9 million decrease in interest expense related to the cumulative repurchase of our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes of $321.3 million since August 2008, a $16.3 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our term loan facility, and a $7.4 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year primarily associated with our revolving credit facility, 9% senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, and the financing liability related to our former corporate headquarters. 41 Table of Contents 2008 compared to 2007 The decrease in other interest expense of $24.7 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily due to a $14.4 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our term loan facility, a $7.9 million decrease in interest expense related to the repurchase of our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes of $232.9 million, and a $6.0 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our revolving credit facility and 9% senior unsecured notes. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility. Gain on Senior Note Repurchases During 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 33.3% in 2009, 13.5% in 2008, and 37.3% in 2007. The tax rate for 2008 reflects the fact that a significant portion of the impairment charges taken in 2008 was not deductible for income tax purposes. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the elimination of a deferred tax liability of $12.7 million, which was reflected as a benefit in our tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with an accounting standard related to unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2010. During 2008, our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately $35 million (net of tax effect) as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in October 2008. During 2007, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $12.0 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters, changes in certain state tax laws, and other adjustments. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated, that we have entered into an agreement to sell or terminate, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction or termination to be probable, with no material changes expected. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $36.2 million during 2009, $30.7 million in 2008, and $5.3 million in 2007, net of income taxes. During 2009, we recorded in discontinued operations estimated losses associated with the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies of approximately $11 million (after tax), including expected losses on the disposition of real estate. 42 Table of Contents See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of discontinued operations. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for years ended 2009, 2008, and 2007 have been adjusted to classify the results of these stores as discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and secured used floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Available Liquidity Resources We had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 173.7 $ 110.2 Revolving Line of Credit (as limited by applicable covenants)(1) $ 163.9 $ 300.8 Secured Used Floorplan Facilities(2) $ 53.1 $ (1) Under our amended credit agreement, we have a $700.0 million revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $64.7 million at December 31, 2009, and $72.4 million at December 31, 2008. The amounts included in the table above reflect our borrowing capacity as limited under the maximum consolidated leverage ratio contained in our amended credit agreement. For additional information regarding our amended credit agreement, please refer to Notes Payable and Long Term Debt Senior Unsecured Notes and Amended Credit Agreement below. (2) We maintain secured used floorplan facilities primarily collateralized by used vehicle inventories and related receivables. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate capacity under these facilities was $170.0 million. As of that date, $80.8 million had been borrowed under these facilities. The remaining borrowing capacity under these facilities of $89.2 million was limited to $53.1 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate capacity under these facilities was $230.0 million. As of that date, $105.0 million had been borrowed under these facilities. The remaining borrowing capacity of $125.0 million was not available since all of our eligible used vehicle inventory had been pledged as collateral. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2009, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $96.4 million, including the $64.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. In February 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscriptions rights, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts and units. Capital Allocation In early 2009, due to the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and abroad, our capital allocation strategy was focused primarily on generating cash and paying down debt to remain in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements. By late 2009, based on our available liquidity and our expected operating cash flows, we adopted a more balanced capital allocation strategy, which included share repurchases and dealership acquisitions. In 2010, we expect to continue to use our cash flow to make capital investments in our business, to complete dealership acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock and or debt. 43 Table of Contents Share Repurchases The following table sets forth information regarding our share repurchases over the past three years: (In millions, except per share data) Years Ended December 31: Shares Repurchased Aggregate Purchase Price Average Purchase Price Per Share 2009 7.7 $135.7 $17.74 2008 3.8 $ 54.1 $14.37 2007 33.2 $645.7 $19.43 In October 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, $256.9 million remained available for share repurchases under our repurchase program. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes. As of January 1, 2010, $45.3 million remained available for share repurchases and other restricted payments under the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes. This amount will increase in future periods by 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture), the net proceeds of stock option exercises, and certain other items, and decrease by the amount of future share repurchases and other restricted payments subject to these limitations. The decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with financial ratios in our debt agreements), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. Senior Note Repurchases The following table sets forth information regarding our debt repurchases over the past three years: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured notes repurchased $ 48.4 $ 105.5 $ Aggregate principal amount of 7% senior unsecured notes repurchased 40.0 127.4 Total $ 88.4 $ 232.9 $ We may from time to time repurchase additional senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt is based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. We may also consider refinancing or restructuring our existing debt obligations. Capital Expenditures The following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy outs $ 75.5 $ 110.4 $ 158.2 We anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately $150 million in 2010, primarily to improve our store facilities. We may from time to time use capital resources for capital expenditures where there are significant opportunities to grow revenue, the expected returns meet or exceed our investment criteria, and the probability of success is significant. 44 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures The following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ (0.2) $ (32.2) $ (6.7) Cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished $ 65.9 $ 49.6 $ 55.1 Cash Dividends We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends. See Restrictions and Covenants below. Notes Payable and Long Term Debt Notes payable and long term debt at December 31 were as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 Floating rate senior unsecured notes, due 2013 $ 146.1 $ 194.5 7% senior unsecured notes, due 2014 132.6 172.6 Term loan facility, due 2012 600.0 600.0 Revolving credit facility, due 2012 Mortgage facility (1) 226.4 233.3 Other debt, due from 2010 to 2025 7.5 58.5 1,112.6 1,258.9 Less: current maturities (7.6) (33.3) Long term debt, net of current maturities $ 1,105.0 $ 1,225.6 (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Senior Unsecured Notes and Amended Credit Agreement At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding $146.1 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, and $132.6 million of 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, in each case at par. The floating rate senior unsecured notes bear interest at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum, adjusted quarterly, and may be redeemed by us currently at 102% of principal, at 101% of principal on or after April 15, 2010, and at 100% of principal on or after April 15, 2011. The 7% senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by us currently at 105.25% of principal, at 103.5% of principal on or after April 15, 2010, at 101.75% of principal on or after April 15, 2011, and at 100% of principal on or after April 15, 2012. During 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, for an aggregate total consideration of $41.1 million. We also repurchased $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, for an aggregate total consideration of $34.5 million. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million during 2009 in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013, for an aggregate total consideration of $79.8 million. We also repurchased $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014, for an aggregate total consideration of $102.3 million. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million during 2008 in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 45 Table of Contents In July 2007, we completed a second amendment of our credit agreement. Under the terms of the second amendment, the interest rate on the term loan facility decreased from LIBOR plus 1.25% to LIBOR plus 0.875% and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased from LIBOR plus 0.80% to LIBOR plus 0.725%. Additionally, the credit agreement termination date was extended from July 14, 2010, to July 18, 2012, and certain other terms and conditions were modified as a result of this amendment. We incurred $1.6 million of expenses in connection with this modification during 2007, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our amended credit agreement which terminates on July 18, 2012, we have a $700.0 million revolving credit facility that provides for various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 0.725% and a $600.0 million term loan facility bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875%. We also have a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $64.7 million at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, leaving $635.3 million of borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2009, this borrowing capacity was limited under the maximum consolidated leverage ratio contained in our amended credit agreement to approximately $164 million. The credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility and term loan facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings from Standard & Poors (BB+, with stable outlook) and Moodys (Ba1, with stable outlook). For instance, under the current terms of our amended credit agreement, a one notch downgrade of our senior unsecured credit rating by either Standard & Poors or Moodys would result in a 25 basis point increase in the credit spread under our term loan facility, a 20 basis point increase in the credit spread under our revolving credit facility, and a 5 basis point increase in the facility fee applicable to our revolving credit facility. Credit ratings and or outlook could be lowered if new vehicle demand worsens significantly, threatening our earnings and cash flow, or if we increase our financial leverage through acquisitions or share repurchases. Credit ratings and or outlook could improve if market demand increases or if we demonstrate our ability to reduce our financial leverage and preserve our ability to generate cash flow while maintaining moderate financial policies. Vehicle Floorplan Payable Vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $357.6 million at December 31, 2009, and $453.4 million at December 31, 2008, and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders. All the floorplan facilities utilize LIBOR based interest rates. Floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables. Other Debt On August 1, 2008, we repaid $14.1 million of 9% senior unsecured notes that matured on that date. At December 31, 2009, we had $226.4 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. The mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in November 2007 to provide a fixed interest rate (5.864%) and provide financing secured by 10 year mortgages on certain of our store properties. In connection with this refinancing, in 2007 we received net proceeds of approximately $126.4 million and recorded $1.0 million of expenses, which are included as a component of Other Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to this refinancing, the facility utilized short term LIBOR based interest rates, which averaged 6.54% for 2007. The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. 46 Table of Contents In 2000, we sold our corporate headquarters facility and leased it back in a transaction that was originally accounted for as a financing. During the first quarter of 2009, we amended this lease, resulting in a change in accounting method from financing to sale leaseback. As a result of this change, we derecognized $21.4 million of assets and a $37.5 million financing liability in the first quarter of 2009. We also recognized a $16.1 million gain on the sale, which is recorded in Other Expenses (Income), Net, and rent expense of $9.1 million, which is recorded in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2009. Restrictions and Covenants Our amended credit agreement, the indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes, our vehicle floorplan payable facilities, and our mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to declare cash dividends, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. For example, under the amended credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (2.75:1), as defined. In March 2008, we amended our credit agreement to provide that non cash impairment losses associated with goodwill and intangible assets as well as certain other non cash charges would be excluded from the computation of the maximum consolidated leverage ratio. We are also required to remain in compliance with a maximum capitalization ratio (65%), as defined. In addition, the indenture for the floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes contains a debt incurrence restriction based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (2.00:1), and the mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage. The indenture for our floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to make payments in connection with share repurchases, dividends, debt retirement, investments, and similar matters to a cumulative aggregate amount that is limited to $500.0 million plus 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income (as defined in the indenture) since April 1, 2006, the net proceeds of stock option exercises, and certain other items, subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the indenture. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements; our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.41:1 and our capitalization ratio was 52.7%, each as defined in our credit agreement. Both the consolidated leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional floorplan indebtedness. To the extent that in the future we believe that we will be unable to comply with the covenants in our amended credit agreement, we will seek an amendment or waiver of our amended credit agreement, which could increase the cost of our debt. We may also consider other options, such as raising capital through an equity issuance to pay down debt, which could be dilutive to stockholders. See the risk factor Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility, and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business in Part I, Item 1A, of this Form 10 K. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the amended credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Certain covenants in the indenture for the floating rate and 7% senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with an upgrade of our senior unsecured notes to investment grade by either Standard & Poors or Moodys. 47 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Variance 2009 vs. 2008 2007 % Variance 2008 vs. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 369.5 $ 684.1 (46.0) $ 205.1 233.5 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 13.9 $ (75.1) NM $ (89.6) (16.2) Cash used in financing activities $ (319.9) $ (532.2) (39.9) $ (136.4) 290.2 NM Not Meaningful Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts in transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable trade, personnel related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties. 2009 compared to 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities during 2009, as compared to 2008, was impacted by a decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital. 2008 compared to 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was affected by a change in the classification of borrowings from a floorplan lender in connection with the sale of a majority stake in General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) by General Motors (GM), which was GMs wholly owned captive finance subsidiary prior to this transaction. As a result of this sale, which occurred on November 30, 2006, we have classified new borrowings from GMAC subsequent to this transaction as vehicle floorplan non trade, with related changes reflected as financing cash flows. Accordingly, net floorplan borrowings from GMAC subsequent to this transaction are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, while repayments in 2007 of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction (totaling $305.8 million during 2007) are reflected as cash used by operating activities. During 2008, all borrowings and repayments related to GMAC were reflected as financing activities, since the repayment of amounts due to GMAC prior to this transaction were completed during 2007. After considering the effect of this reclassification, net cash provided by operating activities during 2008, as compared to 2007, was impacted by an increase in cash provided by changes in working capital, partially offset by a reduction in earnings. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions. 2009 compared to 2008 Cash provided by investing activities increased in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures, including property operating lease buy outs. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We project that 2010 full year capital expenditures will be approximately $150 million. Cash provided by investing activities also increased in 2009 due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment including the disposal of assets held for sale, an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, and a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During 2009, we acquired one automotive retail franchise and other related assets as compared to three in 2008. 48 Table of Contents 2008 compared to 2007 Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity, and changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade. Proceeds received and repayments made under the floorplan credit agreements we entered into during the second quarter of 2008 to finance a portion of our used vehicle inventory were reflected as cash provided by (used in) financing activities during 2009 and 2008. 2009 compared to 2008 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during 2009 primarily due to a decrease in net payments of our revolving credit facility. In 2009, we had no borrowings or repayments of our revolving credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net payments of vehicle floorplan payable non trade. During 2009, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and an increase in the related tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. 2008 compared to 2007 Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise). As discussed above, the repayment of $305.8 million of amounts due to GMAC prior to the sale by GM of a majority interest in GMAC were reflected as cash used by operating activities during 2007, while all repayments to GMAC were reflected as cash used by financing activities during 2008. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less ThanOne Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5Years Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)* $ 1,388.0 $ 1,388.0 $ $ $ Notes payable and long term debt (Note 7)* 1,112.6 7.6 616.7 297.5 190.8 Interest payments ** 141.7 23.5 45.6 38.6 34.0 Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8)*** 592.3 55.5 106.0 85.8 345.0 Acquisition purchase price commitments 29.9 16.8 13.1 Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)* 3.6 0.3 0.1 3.2 Purchase obligations 128.3 54.8 52.6 20.6 0.3 Total $ 3,396.4 $ 1,546.5 $ 821.0 $ 455.6 $ 573.3 * See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ** Primarily represents scheduled interest payments on fixed rate senior unsecured notes and mortgage facilities. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. *** Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2009, these charges totaled approximately $30 million. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2009, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $96.4 million, including $64.7 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans, or goals, are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, foresee, likely, will, or other similar words or phrases. Our forward looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or when made, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include the following: The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. Our results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States. Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, mortgage facility, and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business. 50 Table of Contents We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by and significant influence from vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, term loan facility, and floating rate senior unsecured notes that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our largest stockholder, as a result of its voting ownership, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions. At December 31, 2009, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $366.5 million and had a fair value of $353.3 million. At December 31, 2008, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $465.1 million and had a fair value of $377.8 million. Interest Rate Risk We had $1.4 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payables at December 31, 2009, and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $13.9 million in 2009 and $18.1 million in 2008 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payables is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. We had $0.7 billion of other variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Based on the amounts outstanding at year end, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of $7.5 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2008. 51 Table of Contents
