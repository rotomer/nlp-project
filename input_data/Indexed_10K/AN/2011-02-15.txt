ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented. Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2010, we owned and operated 242 new vehicle franchises from 206 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 31 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 93% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2010, are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, Mercedes, BMW, and Chrysler. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services (also referred to as parts and service), and automotive finance and insurance products (also referred to as finance and insurance), which includes the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, implementing standardized processes, and increasing productivity across all of our stores. As of December 31, 2010, we had three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2010, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue, but approximately 21% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue, and approximately 13% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 21% of total revenue, contributed approximately 65% of our gross profit. Results of Operations We had net income from continuing operations of $235.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.48 in 2010, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $233.1 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in 2009, and a net loss from continuing operations of $1.21 billion and a diluted loss per share of $6.82 in 2008. The 2010 results were adversely impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment, including debt refinancing costs and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs, of $19.6 million ($12.1 million after tax). 27 Table of Contents The 2009 results were impacted by a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $12.7 million, a net gain on asset sales and dispositions of $16.8 million ($10.4 million after tax), and a gain on senior note repurchases of $13.0 million ($8.1 million after tax). See Notes 7 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our results of operations for 2009 were also favorably impacted by the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, commonly referred to as cash for clunkers, that officially began in July 2009 and ended in August 2009. Cash for clunkers stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles, and we sold approximately 12,500 new vehicles under the program. The 2008 results were impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax), non cash franchise impairments of $127.4 million ($79.1 million after tax), a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $35 million, and a gain on senior note repurchases of $51.3 million ($31.5 million after tax). Market Conditions While unemployment in the United States remains high, housing markets remain depressed, and the SAAR remains at historically low levels, we saw an improving automotive retail market during 2010 and expect continued improvement over the next several years. Full year U.S. industry new vehicle sales were 11.5 million in 2010, as compared to 10.4 million in 2009 and 13.2 million in 2008. We currently anticipate full year industry new vehicle sales will increase to approximately 12.8 million units in 2011. However, actual sales may materially differ. While we believe that new vehicle sales will gradually improve in 2011 and over the next several years, we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle sales will remain depressed by historical standards in 2011. In addition, we expect that the decline in new vehicle sales over the past few years, which has led to a decline in the number of recent model year vehicles in operation, our primary service base, may have an adverse impact on our parts and service business for the next several years. Debt Refinancing Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Refinancing below for a discussion of certain refinancing transactions that we completed during the second quarter of 2010. Inventory Management Our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 48,499 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2010, and 35,680 units at December 31, 2009. We continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate. In general, used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $0.4 million at December 31, 2010, and $0.7 million at December 31, 2009. Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first in, first out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $3.4 million at December 31, 2010, and $4.4 million at December 31, 2009. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2008, we recorded $1.61 billion ($1.37 billion after tax) of non cash goodwill impairment charges and $146.5 million ($90.8 million after tax) of non cash impairment charges related to franchise rights. During 2009, we reclassified impairment charges related to franchise rights of $19.1 million ($11.7 million after tax) that were recorded during 2008 to Loss from Discontinued Operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the stores associated with these impairment charges were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2009. We completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill on April 30, 2010, and no goodwill impairment charges resulted from the required impairment test. The goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income valuation approach, which discounts projected free cash flows of the reporting unit at a computed weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate. The income valuation approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include revenue growth rates and future operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. In connection with this process, we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium that represents the estimated amount an investor would pay for our equity securities to obtain a controlling interest. We believe this reconciliation process is consistent with a market participant perspective. We base our cash flow forecasts on our knowledge of the automotive industry, our recent performance, our expectations of our future performance, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We also make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. The test for goodwill impairment is a two step approach. A first step failure would have required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge. As of December 31, 2010, we have $156.1 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $516.7 million related to the Import reporting unit, and $469.3 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit. A significant change in the assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting units. The fair values of the Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of April 30, 2010, the date of our most recent annual impairment test. 29 Table of Contents Our principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested at least annually on April 30 for impairment. The impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives requires the comparison of estimated fair value to its carrying value by store. Fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows of the store. We completed our annual impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives as of April 30, 2010, and no impairment charges resulted from the required impairment tests. Long Lived Assets We estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more likely than not a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held and used are based on Level 3 inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset groups carrying amount exceeds the asset groups estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset. Using the impairment evaluation methodologies described above, we recorded $0.6 million during 2010 of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment held and used in continuing operations to reduce the value of these assets to fair market value. These charges are recorded as a component of Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long lived assets or disposal groups carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources. As of December 31, 2010, we had assets held for sale of $62.5 million in continuing operations and $53.8 million in discontinued operations. During 2010, we recorded net impairment charges of $2.5 million associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations, which is included in Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and $3.4 million associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations, which is included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 30 Table of Contents Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Chargeback Reserve Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts sold, and (iii) insurance and other products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, insurance, or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers (chargebacks). These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. We estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $42.5 million at December 31, 2010, and $48.7 million at December 31, 2009. Chargebacks are influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. The decline in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to lower volume of vehicle sales in recent years, partially offset by an increase in customer cancellations of finance and insurance products. A 10% change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2010, by approximately $4.3 million. See Finance and Insurance below and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Finance Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities. Self Insurance Reserves Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims handling procedures. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self insurance reserves totaled $64.0 million at December 31, 2010, and $70.7 million at December 31, 2009. A 10% change in the volume of claims would have changed our estimated liability at December 31, 2010, by approximately $6.4 million. We believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. 31 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. Accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribe a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to certain legal proceedings, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations, and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation. 32 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2008 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Revenue: New vehicle $ 6,669.1 $ 5,674.6 $ 994.5 17.5 $ 7,339.4 $ (1,664.8 ) (22.7 ) Used vehicle 3,116.1 2,485.9 630.2 25.4 3,111.7 (625.8 ) (20.1 ) Parts and service 2,209.1 2,109.8 99.3 4.7 2,271.1 (161.3 ) (7.1 ) Finance and insurance, net 418.9 348.6 70.3 20.2 455.7 (107.1 ) (23.5 ) Other 47.8 47.1 0.7 60.8 (13.7 ) Total revenue $ 12,461.0 $ 10,666.0 $ 1,795.0 16.8 $ 13,238.7 $ (2,572.7 ) (19.4 ) Gross profit: New vehicle $ 451.2 $ 384.0 $ 67.2 17.5 $ 485.1 $ (101.1 ) (20.8 ) Used vehicle 266.7 228.7 38.0 16.6 261.0 (32.3 ) (12.4 ) Parts and service 963.2 922.2 41.0 4.4 989.3 (67.1 ) (6.8 ) Finance and insurance 418.9 348.6 70.3 20.2 455.7 (107.1 ) (23.5 ) Other 27.5 26.3 1.2 33.9 (7.6 ) Total gross profit 2,127.5 1,909.8 217.7 11.4 2,225.0 (315.2 ) (14.2 ) Selling, general, and administrative expenses 1,552.1 1,446.9 (105.2 ) (7.3 ) 1,675.1 228.2 13.6 Depreciation and amortization 76.8 76.7 (0.1 ) 84.0 7.3 Goodwill impairment 1,610.0 1,610.0 Franchise rights impairment 1.5 1.5 127.4 125.9 Other expenses (income), net 2.0 (23.3 ) (25.3 ) 9.6 32.9 Operating income (loss) 496.6 408.0 88.6 21.7 (1,281.1 ) 1,689.1 NM Floorplan interest expense (42.5 ) (35.7 ) (6.8 ) (79.8 ) 44.1 Other interest expense (56.1 ) (42.6 ) (13.5 ) (89.4 ) 46.8 Loss on debt extinguishment (19.6 ) (19.6 ) Gain on senior note repurchases 13.0 (13.0 ) 51.3 (38.3 ) Interest income 1.4 1.1 0.3 2.2 (1.1 ) Other gains (losses), net 1.5 5.4 (3.9 ) (4.7 ) 10.1 Income (loss) from continuing operations before incometaxes $ 381.3 $ 349.2 $ 32.1 9.2 $ (1,401.5 ) $ 1,750.7 NM Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 206,456 182,160 24,296 13.3 241,625 (59,465 ) (24.6 ) Used vehicle 160,126 133,990 26,136 19.5 166,897 (32,907 ) (19.7 ) 366,582 316,150 50,432 16.0 408,522 (92,372 ) (22.6 ) Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 32,303 $ 31,152 $ 1,151 3.7 $ 30,375 $ 777 2.6 Used vehicle $ 17,266 $ 16,303 $ 963 5.9 $ 15,705 $ 598 3.8 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,185 $ 2,108 $ 77 3.7 $ 2,008 $ 100 5.0 Used vehicle $ 1,612 $ 1,670 $ (58 ) (3.5 ) $ 1,606 $ 64 4.0 Finance and insurance $ 1,143 $ 1,103 $ 40 3.6 $ 1,115 $ (12 ) (1.1 ) NM Not Meaningful 33 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 (%) 2009 (%) 2008 (%) Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle 53.5 53.2 55.4 Used vehicle 25.0 23.3 23.5 Parts and service 17.7 19.8 17.2 Finance and insurance, net 3.4 3.3 3.4 Other 0.4 0.4 0.5 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle 21.2 20.1 21.8 Used vehicle 12.5 12.0 11.7 Parts and service 45.3 48.3 44.5 Finance and insurance 19.7 18.3 20.5 Other 1.3 1.3 1.5 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle 6.8 6.8 6.6 Used vehicle retail 9.3 10.2 10.2 Parts and service 43.6 43.7 43.6 Total 17.1 17.9 16.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12.5 13.6 12.7 Operating income 4.0 3.8 NM Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses 73.0 75.8 75.3 Operating income 23.3 21.4 NM NM Not Meaningful December 31, 2010 2009 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet) 63 days 55 days Used vehicle (trailing 31 days) 42 days 41 days The following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit (cost), consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory).

The Same Store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison, commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us. For example, the results for a dealership acquired in February 2009 would be included only in our same store comparison of 2010 to 2009, not in our same store comparison of 2009 to 2008.

The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers, the reinstatement or expansion of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and an increase in consumer confidence. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for new vehicles in all three segments Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury primarily due to improved market conditions. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed also benefited from a shift in mix toward large vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due in part to a recovery in margins for both small and large vehicles in all three segments as a result of improved market conditions. Additionally, we achieved certain manufacturer incentive program goals during the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result, we were able to recognize certain performance based manufacturer incentives, primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold, which favorably impacted gross profit by $13.1 million and operating income by $11.8 million. We expect to recognize approximately $9 million of additional amounts in operating income related to these incentives over the next two quarters. 37 Table of Contents 2009 compared to 2008 Same store new vehicle revenue decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in same store revenue per new vehicle retailed. The decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment, which for much of 2009 included reduced credit availability offered to consumers, the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and low consumer confidence. The cash for clunkers program discussed above in Results of Operations favorably impacted 2009 results as sales increased during the period the program occurred. Although full year 2009 same store new vehicle sales were lower compared to 2008, same store new vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed benefited from lower average fuel prices, which caused a shift in mix away from more fuel efficient vehicles that have relatively lower selling prices. The increase in same store revenue per new vehicle retailed was also due in part to a recovery in prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased during 2009, as compared to 2008, due in part to a recovery in margins for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Margins also improved partially due to supply and demand imbalances as a result of reduced vehicle production levels of certain automotive manufacturers, which limited supply, and overall improving market conditions in the second half of 2009, which increased demand. New Vehicle Inventories Our new vehicle inventories were $1.5 billion or 63 days supply at December 31, 2010, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.1 billion or 55 days supply at December 31, 2009. We had 48,499 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2010, and 35,680 units at December 31, 2009. The following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit (cost), consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory).

The increase in used vehicle sales volume was driven in part by improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers and an increase in consumer confidence. Additionally, used vehicle sales volumes benefited from an increase in trade in volume associated with the increase in new vehicle sales volume. Same store revenue per used vehicle retailed benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have a higher average selling price than domestic and import vehicles, as well as an increase in the average selling prices for used vehicles in all three segments. The increase in same store revenue per used vehicle retailed was also due in part to tighter supply, which has driven up the wholesale values of used vehicles. Used vehicle inventory has been impacted by the decline in new vehicle sales in recent years, as well as by customers retaining their vehicles for longer periods of time. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed also benefited from a shift in mix toward certified pre owned vehicles, which have higher average selling prices. Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed decreased during 2010, as compared to 2009. While credit availability has improved as compared to the prior year, gross profit per used vehicle retailed was adversely impacted by lender advances not increasing at the same level as used vehicle values. 2009 compared to 2008 Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume, partially offset by an increase in same store revenue per used vehicle retailed. The decrease in used vehicle sales volume was driven by the challenging automotive retail environment in which we maintained relatively low levels of used vehicle inventory during most of 2009 in response to the economic downturn. Used vehicle sales volume was also constrained by the reduced credit availability offered to consumers for much of 2009. Additionally, used vehicle sales volume was adversely impacted by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales. Same store revenue per used vehicle retailed benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have higher average selling prices than domestic and import vehicles. This benefit was partially offset, however, by a decrease in the average revenue per used vehicle retailed for premium luxury vehicles. The increase in same store revenue per used vehicle retailed was also due in part to a recovery in prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices. Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed increased during 2009, as compared to 2008, as tighter inventories improved profitability per unit. Used vehicle inventory supply has been impacted by the decline in new vehicle sales, which has reduced trade in volume, as well as by customers retaining their vehicles for longer periods of time. Additionally, reduced fleet inventory has decreased the number of vehicles moving from fleet inventory to used vehicle inventory. Gross profit per used vehicle retailed also benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have higher average gross margins than domestic and import vehicles. Used Vehicle Inventories Used vehicle inventories were $271.8 million or 42 days supply at December 31, 2010, compared to $219.5 million or 41 days at December 31, 2009. 40 Table of Contents Parts & Service Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from vehicle repairs paid directly by the customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranty programs.

Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties benefited from higher new and used vehicle sales volume. Warranty was favorably impacted by the rise in manufacturer recalls in the automotive industry, partially offset by an adverse impact from fewer vehicles in operation as a result of lower vehicle sales in recent years and, to a lesser extent, improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years. Wholesale and retail counter parts gross profit increased in 2010 primarily due to improving market conditions. 2009 compared to 2008 During 2009, same store parts and service gross profit decreased as compared to 2008. This decrease is primarily due to declines in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties of $22.3 million, warranty of $15.1 million, customer pay service of $14.9 million, and wholesale and retail counter parts of $5.2 million. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale and service work outsourced to third parties was adversely impacted primarily by lower new and used vehicle sales volume. Warranty was adversely impacted by fewer vehicles in operation as a result of lower vehicle sales in recent years and, to a lesser extent, improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years. Customer pay service and wholesale and retail counter parts gross profit were also adversely impacted by fewer vehicles in operation, as well as by the difficult market conditions. 41 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % Variance 2008 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 418.9 $ 348.6 $ 70.3 20.2 $ 455.7 $ (107.1 ) (23.5 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,143 $ 1,103 $ 40 3.6 $ 1,115 $ (12 ) (1.1 ) Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % Variance 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 414.3 $ 348.0 $ 66.3 19.1 $ 349.7 $ 456.4 $ (106.7 ) (23.4 ) Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,146 $ 1,104 $ 42 3.8 $ 1,103 $ 1,117 (14 ) (1.3 ) 2010 compared to 2009 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in new and used vehicle sales volumes. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed increased during 2010, as compared to 2009. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed during 2010 benefited from more customers financing vehicles through the dealerships and an increase in amounts financed per transaction. 2009 compared to 2008 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower new and used sales volumes. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit during 2009 were impacted by a favorable adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 2009 of $5.2 million ($3.2 million after tax) on our reserves for expected chargebacks. Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed decreased during 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed were adversely impacted by fewer customers financing vehicles through the dealerships. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed were also adversely impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, including lower commissions due to tightness in the automotive lending environment for much of 2009, partially offset by an increase in finance and insurance products sold per customer. 42 Table of Contents Segment Results In the following table of financial data, total Segment Income (Loss) of the operating segments is reconciled to consolidated operating income (loss).

The increase in new and used unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers, reinstatement or expansion of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and an increase in consumer confidence. Additionally, new vehicle unit volume in the prior year was adversely impacted by customer uncertainty surrounding the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies. Revenue per new and used vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for both small and large vehicles. New and used revenue and unit sales increased for both Ford and General Motors as compared to the prior year. Domestic segment income increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in new and used unit volume and a recovery in new vehicle margins for both small and large vehicles as a result of improved market conditions. Domestic segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to higher new and used vehicle sales. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses. 2009 compared to 2008 Domestic revenue decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. For much of 2009, a reduction in the availability of customer financing, including the discontinuation or limitation of certain lease programs for domestic vehicles, and customer uncertainty surrounding the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies contributed to the decline in sales volume from our Domestic stores. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per new vehicle retailed for domestic vehicles due to a recovery in prices for large vehicles. Prices for large vehicles, including trucks and sport utility vehicles, increased as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices in 2009. The decrease in sales volume was also partially mitigated by the sales of vehicles under the cash for clunkers program. Although full year 2009 Domestic new vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Domestic new vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Domestic segment income decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased revenues as a result of the competitive retail environment. Domestic segment income was also impacted by a decrease in finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed as a result of the reduction in credit availability. Domestic segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. In the second quarter of 2009, each of Chrysler and General Motors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the bankruptcies, we closed certain Chrysler and General Motors dealerships, the operating results of which were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Import The Import segment operating results included the following: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2008 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance Revenue $ 4,708.4 $ 4,103.8 $ 604.6 14.7 $ 5,251.8 $ (1,148.0 ) (21.9 ) Segment income $ 199.5 $ 175.4 $ 24.1 13.7 $ 185.2 $ (9.8 ) (5.3 ) Retail new vehicle unit sales 107,580 97,538 10,042 10.3 131,957 (34,419 ) (26.1 ) 2010 compared to 2009 Import revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due to an increase in new and used unit volume and an increase in revenue per new and used vehicle retailed. The increase in new and used unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers and an increase in consumer confidence. Revenue per new and used vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for both small and large vehicles. Import segment income increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a recovery in new vehicle margins for both small and large vehicles as a result of improved market conditions. Import segment income also benefited from an increase in parts and service business, which has higher margins, and an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to higher new and used vehicle sales. Increases in Import segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses. 2009 compared to 2008 Import revenue decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales. Lower sales were partially attributable during the first half of 2009 to a decline in customer demand for import vehicles due to a shift in consumer preferences away from more fuel efficient vehicles as fuel prices decreased. The decrease in sales volume was partially mitigated by the sales of vehicles under the cash for clunkers program. Although full year 2009 Import new and used vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Import new and used vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Import segment income decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, driven largely by a decline in sales due to a competitive retail environment. Import segment income was also impacted by a decrease in finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed as a result of tighter credit conditions. Import segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. 45 Table of Contents Premium Luxury The Premium Luxury segment operating results included the following: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2008 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue $ 3,509.0 $ 3,073.1 $ 435.9 14.2 $ 3,629.5 $ (556.4 ) (15.3 ) Segment income $ 208.4 $ 175.5 $ 32.9 18.7 $ 183.7 $ (8.2 ) (4.5 ) Retail new vehicle unit sales 34,559 32,091 2,468 7.7 40,128 (8,037 ) (20.0 ) 2010 compared to 2009 Premium Luxury revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due to an increase in new and used unit volume and an increase in revenue per new and used vehicle retailed. The increase in new and used unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers and an increase in consumer confidence. Revenue per new and used vehicle retailed benefited primarily from an increase in the average selling prices for large vehicles. Premium Luxury segment income increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a recovery in new vehicle margins for small and large vehicles, as a result of improved market conditions. Premium Luxury segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to higher new and used vehicle sales. Additionally, as noted above in New Vehicle section, we achieved certain manufacturer incentive program goals during the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result, we were able to recognize certain performance based manufacturer incentives, primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold, which favorably impacted Premium Luxury segment income. Increases in Premium Luxury segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses. 2009 compared to 2008 Premium Luxury revenue decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales and a decrease in revenue per new vehicle retailed, reflecting the challenging automotive retail environment. Although full year 2009 Premium Luxury new and used vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year, Premium Luxury new and used vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Premium Luxury segment income decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower vehicle sales, in addition to margin compression as a result of a decrease in the average revenue per new vehicle retailed. Premium Luxury segment income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2009, as compared to 2008, benefited from a mix shift toward higher margin parts and service business, a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a reduction in floorplan interest expense. 46 Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Our Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (SG&A) consist primarily of compensation, including salaries, commissions and incentive based compensation, as well as advertising (net of reimbursement based manufacturer advertising rebates), occupancy costs, legal, accounting, and professional services, and general corporate expenses. 2010 compared to 2009 SG&A expenses increased $105.2 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, due to a $90.0 million volume driven increase in compensation expense and a $20.0 million increase in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 73.0% in 2010 from 75.8% in 2009 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure and improved gross profit. 2009 compared to 2008 SG&A expenses decreased $228.2 million during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to a $137.6 million decrease in compensation expense and a $39.2 million decrease in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased to 75.8% in 2009 from 75.3% in 2008 resulting from a deleveraging of our cost structure due to the decline in vehicle sales, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives. Non Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $42.5 million in 2010, $35.7 million in 2009, and $79.8 million in 2008. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in floorplan interest expense of $6.8 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances. 2009 compared to 2008 The decrease in floorplan interest expense of $44.1 million in 2009, as compared to 2008, is primarily the result of lower short term LIBOR interest rates and lower average vehicle floorplan payable balances. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, mortgage facility, and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $56.1 million in 2010, $42.6 million in 2009, and $89.4 million in 2008. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in other interest expense of $13.5 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and revolving credit facilities, and a $3.6 million in increase in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates on our extended term loan facility. These increases were partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease due to lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, 7% Senior Notes due 2014, and mortgage facility. 2009 compared to 2008 The decrease in other interest expense of $46.8 million in 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to a $20.9 million decrease in interest expense related to the cumulative repurchase of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Notes due 2014 of $321.3 million since August 2008, a $16.3 million decrease in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on our term loan facility, and a $7.4 million decrease in 47 Table of Contents interest expense resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year primarily associated with our revolving credit facility, 9% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2008, mortgage facility, and the financing liability related to our former corporate headquarters. Loss on Debt Extinguishment We expensed $19.6 million pre tax in the second quarter of 2010, related to the debt refinancing transactions discussed below, including $3.5 million for the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs. This expense is recorded in Loss on Debt Extinguishment in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gain on Senior Note Repurchases During 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, and $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, and $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. Our effective income tax rate was 38.3% in 2010, and reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. As of December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with an accounting standard related to unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2011. Our effective income tax rate was 33.2% in 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the elimination of a deferred tax liability of $12.7 million, which was reflected as a benefit in our tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 13.5% in 2008. The tax rate for 2008 reflects the fact that a significant portion of the impairment charges taken in 2008 was not deductible for income tax purposes. During 2008, our unrecognized tax benefits and associated accumulated interest and penalties were reduced by approximately $35 million (net of tax effect) as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in October 2008. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated, that we have entered into an agreement to sell or terminate, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction or termination to be probable, with no material changes expected. We account for a store that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale as a discontinued operation if (a) the operations and cash flows of the store have been (or will be) eliminated from our ongoing operations and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the store after the disposal transaction. 48 Table of Contents In evaluating whether a stores cash flows will be eliminated from our ongoing operations, we consider whether we expect to continue to generate revenues or incur expenses from the sale of similar products or services to customers of the disposed store in the same geographic market. If we believe that a significant portion of the cash flows previously generated by the disposed store will migrate to our other operating stores, we will not treat the disposition as a discontinued operation. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $8.7 million in 2010, $35.1 million in 2009, and $30.8 million in 2008, net of income taxes. During 2009, we recorded in discontinued operations estimated losses associated with the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies of approximately $11 million (after tax), including expected losses on the disposition of real estate. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of discontinued operations. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for years ended 2010, 2009, and 2008 have been adjusted to classify the results of these stores as discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities and secured used floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Debt Refinancing On March 31, 2010, we (1) commenced cash tender offers (referred to as the tender offers) to purchase any and all of our outstanding floating rate senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2013 (also referred to as the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013) and 7% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2014 (also referred to as the 7% Senior Notes due 2014, and together with the Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, the old notes), (2) commenced related solicitations of consents from the holders of the old notes to certain amendments to the indenture for the old notes, (3) commenced a public offering (referred to as the debt offering) of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2018 (referred to as the new notes or the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018), and (4) announced our intention to amend and extend our credit agreement (we refer to our credit agreement, as it was prior to its amendment on April 14, 2010, as the prior credit agreement). Subsequently, also on March 31, 2010, we priced the new notes at 98.488% of the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount with an interest rate equal to 6.75% and a maturity date of April 15, 2018, providing for a yield to maturity of 7.0%. In April 2010, we (1) accepted for payment, and thereafter cancelled, all of our outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 88.9% of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014, representing an aggregate principal amount of $264.0 million of old notes, (2) amended the indenture for the old notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to shorten the notice periods required to undertake an optional redemption, (3) closed the debt offering and issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, and (4) amended and extended our credit agreement (we refer to our credit agreement, as it was amended on April 14, 2010, as the amended credit agreement). Following the completion of the tender offers and as of December 31, 2010, no Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Senior Notes due 2014 remained outstanding. 49 Table of Contents Our prior credit agreement, which was scheduled to terminate on July 18, 2012, provided for a $600.0 million term loan facility and a $700.0 million revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the amendment to our credit agreement, our term loan facility was reduced to $533.4 million and bifurcated into a $54.0 million tranche due July 18, 2012 (the non extended term loan facility) and a $479.4 million tranche due July 18, 2014 (the extended term loan facility). Our revolving credit facility was reduced to $638.6 million and bifurcated into a $57.0 million tranche due July 18, 2012 (the non extended revolving credit facility) and a $581.6 million tranche due July 18, 2014 (the extended revolving credit facility). The amendment also modified certain financial covenants for all tranches, including an increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75x to 3.25x and a decrease in the maximum capitalization ratio from 65% to 60%. In calculating our leverage ratio, we are no longer required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million), and, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are now permitted to add back to shareholders equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long lived asset impairment charges subsequent to 2007. See Long Term Debt Amended Credit Agreement below for additional information regarding our amended credit agreement and Long Term Debt Restrictions and Covenants for additional information regarding our financial covenants. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 was used (1) to pay approximately $274.5 million for the old notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment (which included accrued and unpaid interest for the old notes, as well as consent payments for those that were tendered and accepted for payment by April 13, 2010), (2) to reduce the size of our term loan facility by approximately $66.6 million (from $600.0 million to $533.4 million), (3) to pay transaction fees and expenses related to the debt offering, the tender offers, and the amendment to the credit agreement, and (4) for general corporate purposes. We expensed $19.6 million pre tax in the second quarter of 2010, related to these transactions, including $3.5 million for the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the old notes and prior credit agreement. The transactions described above extended our debt maturities, increased our available liquidity, and lowered our exposure to interest rate increases in the future. We believe that these transactions will provide us with additional flexibility to manage our business and optimize capital allocation. See Capital Allocation below for additional information regarding our capital allocation strategy. Available Liquidity Resources We had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 95.1 $ 173.5 Revolving Credit Facility $ 398.9 (1) $ 163.9 (2) Secured Used Floorplan Facilities (3) $ 70.6 $ 53.1 (1) Based on aggregate borrowings outstanding of $180.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $59.7 million at December 31, 2010. See Long Term Debt Amended Credit Agreement for additional information. (2) As limited by the applicable maximum leverage ratio that was contained in our credit agreement at December 31, 2009. See Long Term Debt Restrictions and Covenants for additional information regarding our financial covenants. (3) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Long Term Debt Vehicle Floorplan Payable for additional information. 50 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2010, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $91.0 million, including the $59.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. In February 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscriptions rights, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, and units. Our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 were offered pursuant to this shelf registration statement. Capital Allocation We use our capital resources to make capital investments in our business, to complete dealership acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock and or debt. During 2010, based on an anticipated industry recovery over the next several years, our operating performance and confidence in our financial and operational strength, and the additional liquidity and financial flexibility that we obtained as a result of our debt refinancing (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Refinancing), we opportunistically increased both our share repurchase and acquisition activities as outlined below. Share Repurchases A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows: (In millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 2008 Shares repurchased 26.6 7.7 3.8 Aggregate purchase price $ 523.7 $ 135.7 $ 54.1 Average purchase price per share $ 19.70 $ 17.74 $ 14.37 The decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our 3.25x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. The April 14, 2010 amendment to the indenture for our old notes eliminated, among other things, a restricted payments covenant that previously limited our ability to repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, and make certain other restricted payments. While the indenture governing our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 does contain certain limited covenants as described below under Restrictions and Covenants, it does not contain a restricted payments covenant that directly limits share repurchases and other uses of capital. As a result, under the indenture for our new notes, we have additional flexibility to optimize our capital allocation, including to repurchase shares. On July 20, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, $233.2 million remained available for share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. 51 Table of Contents Senior Note Repurchases The following table sets forth information regarding our debt repurchases over the past three years: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Aggregate principal amount repurchased: Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 $ $ 48.4 $ 105.5 7% Senior Notes due 2014 40.0 127.4 Total $ $ 88.4 $ 232.9 We may from time to time repurchase our outstanding senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt is based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. See Debt Refinancing above for information regarding certain refinancing transactions, including cash tender offers to purchase our Floating Rate Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Notes due 2014, that we completed during the second quarter of 2010. Capital Expenditures The following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy outs $ 161.8 $ 75.4 $ 110.2 Excluding acquisition related spending, land purchased for future sites, and lease buy outs, and net of related asset sales, we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately $140 million in 2011, primarily related to our store facilities. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years: (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash received from (used in) business acquisitions, net $ (73.1 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (32.2 ) Cash received from (used in) business divestitures, net $ 13.0 $ 65.9 $ 49.6 We acquired five automotive retail franchises and related assets during 2010, compared to one in 2009 and three in 2008. We have entered into an agreement to acquire Ft. Myers Toyota in Florida. The acquisition of this store is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011. Cash Dividends We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As discussed above, the restricted payments covenant contained in the indenture for our old notes, which previously limited, among other things, our ability to pay cash dividends, has been eliminated. 52 Table of Contents Long Term Debt The following table sets forth our non vehicle long term debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In millions) 2010 2009 Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 $ $ 146.1 7% Senior Notes due 2014 14.7 132.6 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 394.4 Term loan facility due 2012 54.0 600.0 Term loan facility due 2014 479.4 Revolving credit facility due 2012 16.1 Revolving credit facility due 2014 163.9 Mortgage facility (1) 219.2 226.4 Other debt due from 2011 to 2025 7.0 7.5 1,348.7 1,112.6 Less: current maturities (8.1 ) (7.6 ) Long term debt, net of current maturities $ 1,340.6 $ 1,105.0 (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Senior Unsecured Notes On April 14, 2010, we completed our offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018. The 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 were sold at 98.488% of the aggregate principal amount providing for a yield to maturity of 7.0%. Interest on the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. These notes will mature on April 15, 2018. See Debt Refinancing above for additional information. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding $394.4 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and $14.7 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2014. The 7% Senior Notes due 2014 may be redeemed by us currently at 103.5% of principal, at 101.75% of principal on or after April 15, 2011, and at 100% of principal on or after April 15, 2012. During 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 for an aggregate total consideration of $41.1 million. We also repurchased $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014 for an aggregate total consideration of $34.5 million. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million during 2009 in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2008, we repurchased $105.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 for an aggregate total consideration of $79.8 million. We also repurchased $127.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014 for an aggregate total consideration of $102.3 million. We recorded a gain of $51.3 million during 2008 in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The 7% Senior Notes due 2014 and the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. 53 Table of Contents Amended Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2010, we had borrowings outstanding of $16.1 million under the non extended revolving credit facility and $163.9 million under the extended revolving credit facility. We have a $200 million letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facilities. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facilities is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $59.7 million at December 31, 2010. Our additional borrowing capacity in the aggregate under both the non extended and extended revolving credit facilities was $398.9 million at December 31, 2010. Our prior term loan facility provided, and our non extended term loan facility provides, for various interest rates generally at LIBOR plus 0.875%. Our prior revolving credit facility provided, and our non extended revolving credit facility provides, for a 0.15% facility fee and various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 0.725%. Our extended term loan facility provides for various interest rates generally at LIBOR plus 2.25%, and our extended revolving credit facility provides for a commitment fee on undrawn amounts of 0.50% and various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 2.25%. The credit spread charged for our prior term loan and revolving credit facilities was, and the credit spread charged for our non extended term loan and revolving credit facilities is, impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings. The credit spread charged for both the extended term loan facility and the extended revolving credit facility is affected by our leverage ratio. For instance, an increase in our leverage ratio from greater than or equal to 2.0x but less than 3.0x to greater than or equal to 3.0x would result in a 25 basis point increase in the credit spread under both our extended term loan facility and extended revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the amended credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Vehicle Floorplan Payable Vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $486.5 million at December 31, 2010, and $353.5 million at December 31, 2009, and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders, as well as amounts borrowed under our secured used floorplan facilities, which are primarily collateralized by used vehicle inventories and related receivables. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate capacity under our used floorplan facilities was $170.0 million. As of that date, $89.0 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $81.0 million was limited to $70.6 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate capacity under our used floorplan facilities was $170.0 million. As of that date, $80.8 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $89.2 million was limited to $53.1 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. All the vehicle floorplan facilities utilize LIBOR based interest rates. Vehicle floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new vehicle floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Vehicle floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables. 54 Table of Contents Other Debt At December 31, 2010, we had $219.2 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. The mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in November 2007 to provide a fixed interest rate (5.864%) and provide financing secured by 10 year mortgages on certain of our store properties. In 2000, we sold our corporate headquarters facility and leased it back in a transaction that was originally accounted for as a financing. During the first quarter of 2009, we amended this lease, resulting in a change in accounting method from financing to sale leaseback. As a result of this change, we derecognized $21.4 million of assets and a $37.5 million financing liability in the first quarter of 2009, when we also recognized a $7.6 million gain on the sale, which is recorded in Other Expenses (Income), Net, and $1.8 million of rent expense, which is recorded in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The remaining gain of $8.5 million and remaining rent expense of $9.1 million were fully recognized through the third quarter of 2009. Restrictions and Covenants Our amended credit agreement, the indenture for our new notes, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. Under our prior credit agreement we were, and under our amended credit agreement we are, required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Pursuant to the April 14, 2010 amendment to our credit agreement, both of these covenants were modified. Under the amended credit agreement, the maximum capitalization ratio is 60%, compared to 65% prior to the amendment, and the maximum leverage ratio is 3.25x, compared to 2.75x prior to the amendment. In addition, in calculating our leverage ratio, we are no longer required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million), and, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are now permitted to add back to shareholders equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long lived asset impairment charges subsequent to 2007. The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our amended credit agreement, which we filed with our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the second quarter of 2010 on July 22, 2010. The indenture for our old notes previously contained several covenants, including a restricted payments covenant and a debt incurrence restriction, that were eliminated as part of the tender offers and consent solicitations described above. The indenture for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 contains certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions, but does not contain a restricted payments covenant or a debt incurrence restriction. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our amended credit agreement, at December 31, 2010, our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows: December 31, 2010 Requirement Actual Leverage ratio &lt;3.25x 2.41 Capitalization ratio &lt; 60% 47.2% 55 Table of Contents Both the leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional vehicle floorplan indebtedness. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the amended credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Cash Flows The following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities: ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 251.8 $ 369.3 $ 684.2 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (200.2 ) $ 14.0 $ (75.1 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (130.0 ) $ (319.9 ) $ (532.2 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts in transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable trade, personnel related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties. 2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, we paid $28.1 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness, including debt tender premiums. Cash flows from operating activities reflect $16.1 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to these transactions. In addition, we charged to expense $3.5 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities, discussed below, reflect $11.9 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the new debt arrangements. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements and debt refinancing costs noted above. 2009 compared to 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. Excluding acquisition related spending, land purchased for future sites, and lease buy outs, and net of related asset sales, we project that 2011 capital expenditures will be approximately $140 million. 56 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 We had net cash used in investing activities during 2010, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in 2009, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During 2010, we acquired five automotive retail franchises and other related assets as compared to one in 2009. Net cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by a decrease in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished. 2009 compared to 2008 Cash provided by investing activities increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures, including property operating lease buy outs. Cash provided by investing activities also increased in 2009 due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, including the disposal of assets held for sale, an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, and a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During 2009, we acquired one automotive retail franchise and other related assets as compared to three in 2008. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade, and stock option exercises. 2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, we repurchased 26.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $523.7 million (average purchase price per share of $19.70). During 2010, 36,614 shares were surrendered to AutoNation to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2009, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $135.7 million (average purchase price per share of $17.74), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2009. Additionally, 18,648 shares were surrendered to AutoNation to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2010, we (1) accepted for payment, and thereafter cancelled, all of our outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 88.9% of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014, representing an aggregate principal amount of $264.0 million of old notes, (2) amended the indenture for the old notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to shorten the notice periods required to undertake an optional redemption, (3) closed the debt offering and issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, and (4) amended and extended our credit agreement (we refer to our credit agreement, as it was amended on April 14, 2010, as the amended credit agreement). The 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 were sold at 98.488% of the aggregate principal amount providing for a yield to maturity of 7.0%. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 was used (1) to pay approximately $274.5 million for the old notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment (which included accrued and unpaid interest for the old notes, as well as consent payments for those that were tendered and accepted for payment by April 13, 2010), (2) to reduce the size of our term loan facility by approximately $66.6 million (from $600.0 million to $533.4 million), (3) to pay transaction fees and expenses related to the debt offering, the tender offers, and the amendment to the credit agreement, and (4) for general corporate purposes. As noted above under Cash Flows from Operating Activities, cash flows from financing activities reflect cash payments of $11.9 million that will be amortized to expense over the term of the new debt arrangements. During 2010, we borrowed $305.0 million and repaid $125.0 million under our revolving credit facility, for net borrowings of $180.0 million. During 2009, we had no borrowings or repayments under our revolving credit facility. 57 Table of Contents We did not repurchase any of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 or 7% Senior Notes due 2014 during 2010. During 2009, we repurchased $88.4 million aggregate principal amount of our old notes for an aggregate total consideration of $75.6 million (including $1.2 million of accrued interest). Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling net proceeds of $117.0 million during 2010 compared to net payments of $100.9 million in 2009. During 2010, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and an increase in the related tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2009. 2009 compared to 2008 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during 2009, as compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in net payments of our revolving credit facility. In 2009, we had no borrowings or repayments of our revolving credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net payments of vehicle floorplan payable non trade. During 2009, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and an increase in the related tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2008. Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1Year(2011) 1 3 Years(2012 and2013) 3 5 Years(2014 and2015) More Than 5Years(2016 andthereafter) Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)(1) $ 1,866.4 $ 1,866.4 $ $ $ Long term debt, including capital leases (Note 7)(1) 1,348.7 8.1 90.5 675.1 575.0 Interest payments (2) 291.8 41.8 81.9 78.0 90.1 Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8)(3) 534.8 55.8 96.8 76.5 305.7 Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)(1) 5.7 1.3 1.1 3.3 Deferred compensation obligations (4) 28.8 28.8 Estimated liability for chargebacks (Note 19)(5) 42.5 24.7 16.1 1.6 0.1 Estimated liability for self insurance obligations(6) 64.0 27.8 21.8 9.6 4.8 Purchase obligations 142.2 70.1 54.7 17.4 Total $ 4,324.9 $ 2,096.0 $ 362.9 $ 858.2 $ 1,007.8 (1) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Primarily represents scheduled interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes and mortgage facility. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. (3) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2010, these charges totaled approximately $27 million. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments, obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years column. 58 Table of Contents (5) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments can be estimated based on historical patterns. (6) Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. These amounts are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2010, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $91.0 million, of which $59.7 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Seasonality Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs. 59 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including statements regarding our expectations for the automotive retail industry, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Words such as anticipate, expect, intend, goal, plan, believe, continue, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Our forward looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retailing industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. Our results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States. Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores. We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer. 60 Table of Contents We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and term loan facility that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. These stockholders are represented on our Board of Directors and, therefore, may also have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our Board. In addition, future share repurchases and purchases by our affiliates could further reduce our public float and adversely impact the liquidity of our common stock. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions. At December 31, 2010, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $635.3 million and had a fair value of $644.1 million. At December 31, 2009, our fixed rate debt, primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and mortgages, totaled $366.5 million and had a fair value of $353.3 million. Interest Rate Risk We had $1.9 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payable at December 31, 2010, and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $18.7 million in 2010 and $13.7 million in 2009 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates. We had $713.4 million of other variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, and $746.1 million at December 31, 2009. Based on the amounts outstanding at year end, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to annual interest expense of $7.1 million in 2010 and $7.5 million in 2009. 61 Table of Contents
