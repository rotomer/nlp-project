ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10 K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K.Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented.Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.OverviewAutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2011, we owned and operated 258 new vehicle franchises from 215 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 32 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 90% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2011, are manufactured by Ford, Toyota, Nissan, General Motors, Honda, Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Chrysler.We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services (also referred to as parts and service), and automotive finance and insurance products (also referred to as finance and insurance), which includes the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management, implementing standardized processes, and increasing productivity across all of our stores.As of December 31, 2011, we had three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products.For the year ended December 31, 2011, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue, but approximately 24% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue, and approximately 12% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 20% of total revenue, contributed approximately 63% of our gross profit.Results of OperationsWe had net income from continuing operations of $284.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.93 in 2011, as compared to net income from continuing operations of $235.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.48 in 2010, and net income from continuing operations of $233.1 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in 2009.The 2011 results were impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment, including debt refinancing costs and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs, of $2.2 million ($1.4 million after tax).The 2010 results were impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment, including debt refinancing costs and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs, of $19.6 million ($12.1 million after tax).The 2009 results were impacted by a favorable tax adjustment of approximately $12.7 million, a net gain on asset sales and dispositions of $16.8 million ($10.4 million after tax), and a gain on senior note repurchases of $13.0 million ($8.1 million after tax). See Notes 7 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our results of operations for 2009 were also favorably impacted by the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, 23Table of Contentscommonly referred to as cash for clunkers, that officially began in July 2009 and ended in August 2009. Cash for clunkers stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles, and we sold approximately 12,500 new vehicles under the program.Market ConditionsFull year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 12.7 million in 2011, as compared to 11.5 million in 2010 and 10.4 million in 2009. While unemployment in the United States remained high, housing markets remained depressed, and the SAAR remained below pre recession levels, we saw an improving automotive retail market during 2011 as compared to the past few years, and we expect continued improvement over the next several years. We currently anticipate full year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales will increase to approximately 14.0 million in 2012. However, actual sales may materially differ.In 2011, the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan and the flooding in Thailand caused significant production and supply chain disruptions that resulted in significantly reduced new vehicle production and lower new vehicle shipments by Japanese manufacturers. These disruptions also impacted non Japanese manufacturers that rely on components produced in Japan and or Thailand. In 2011, our unit sales of new vehicles were adversely impacted by these disruptions; however, gross profit per vehicle retailed benefited significantly from constrained supply. Shipments from Japanese manufacturers began to improve at the end of the third quarter and continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that the improving supply environment will result in lower gross profit per vehicle retailed in 2012.While we believe that new vehicle unit sales will improve in 2012 and over the next several years, we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle unit sales will remain below pre recession levels in 2012. The rate of industry new vehicle unit sales over the past few years has led to a decline in the number of recent model year vehicles in operation, our primary service base, and it may take several years for this service base to return to pre recession levels. Debt RefinancingPlease refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Refinancing Transactions below for a discussion of certain refinancing transactions that we completed during the second quarter of 2010, the fourth quarter of 2011, and the first quarter of 2012.Inventory ManagementOur new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 43,906 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2011, and 48,499 units at December 31, 2010. We continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate.In general, used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $0.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $0.4 million at December 31, 2010.Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first in, first out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of $2.8 million at December 31, 2011, and $3.4 million at December 31, 2010.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set 24Table of Contentsforth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill as of April 30, 2011, and no goodwill impairment charges resulted from the required impairment test. The goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.As discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income valuation approach, which discounts projected free cash flows of the reporting unit at a computed weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate. The income valuation approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include revenue growth rates and future operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. In connection with this process, we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium that represents the estimated amount an investor would pay for our equity securities to obtain a controlling interest. We believe this reconciliation process is consistent with a market participant perspective. We base our cash flow forecasts on our knowledge of the automotive industry, our recent performance, our expectations of our future performance, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We also make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.The test for goodwill impairment is a two step approach. A first step failure would have required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge. As of December 31, 2011, we have $156.4 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $531.6 million related to the Import reporting unit, and $484.2 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit. A significant change in the assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting units.The fair values of the Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of April 30, 2011, the date of our most recent annual impairment test.Other Intangible AssetsOur principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested at least annually on April 30 for impairment. The impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives requires the comparison of estimated fair value to its carrying value by store. Fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows of the store. The forecasted cash flows contain inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates, margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and cost of capital, for which we utilize certain market participant based assumptions, using third party industry projections, economic projections, and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable.We completed our annual impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives as of April 30, 2011, and no impairment charges resulted from the required impairment tests. Our franchise rights, which related to 28 franchises and totaled $212.6 million at April 30, 2011, are evaluated for impairment on a franchise by franchise basis. If the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to a be a hypothetical 10% lower as of the valuation date of April 30, 2011, the resulting impairment charge would have been less than $3.0 million.Long Lived AssetsWe estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more likely than not a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly 25Table of Contentsbefore the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.When evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset groups estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held and used are based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset groups carrying amount exceeds the asset groups estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.When property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long lived assets or disposal groups carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets.We had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $70.1 million at December 31, 2011, and $62.5 million at December 31, 2010. We recorded $1.1 million during 2011 and $2.5 million during 2010 of non cash impairment charges associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value less cost to sell. During 2011, we also recorded $1.1 million of non cash impairment charges related to a valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation not recorded during the held for sale period for continuing operations assets that were reclassified from held for sale to held and used during 2011. The 2011 and 2010 charges are recorded as a component of Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are reported in the "Corporate and other" category of our segment information. We had assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $49.5 million at December 31, 2011, and $53.8 million at December 31, 2010. We recorded $0.5 million during 2011 and $3.4 million during 2010 of non cash impairment charges associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value less cost to sell. These charges are recorded as a component of Loss from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Income Statements.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets.Chargeback ReserveRevenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts sold, and (iii) insurance and other products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned.We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, insurance, or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers (chargebacks). These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks.26Table of ContentsWe estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $46.2 million at December 31, 2011, and $42.5 million at December 31, 2010.Chargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to higher volume of vehicle sales in recent years, as well as an increase in customer cancellations of finance and insurance products. A 10% change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2011, by approximately $4.6 million.See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Finance Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities.Self Insurance ReservesUnder our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims handling procedures. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self insurance reserves totaled $58.2 million at December 31, 2011, and $64.0 million at December 31, 2010. A 10% change in the volume of claims would have changed our estimated liability at December 31, 2011, by approximately $5.8 million. We believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.Revenue RecognitionRevenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition.Income TaxesEstimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs.Accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribe a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position.27Table of ContentsAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.OtherAdditionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to certain legal proceedings, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations, and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation.28Table of ContentsReported Operating Data Years Ended December 31,($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 20092011 2010 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %VarianceRevenue: New vehicle$7,498.9 $6,669.1 $829.8 12.4 $5,674.6 $994.5 17.5Used vehicle3,512.8 3,116.1 396.7 12.7 2,485.9 630.2 25.4Parts and service2,293.1 2,209.1 84.0 3.8 2,109.8 99.3 4.7Finance and insurance, net474.5 418.9 55.6 13.3 348.6 70.3 20.2Other53.0 47.8 5.2 47.1 0.7 Total revenue$13,832.3 $12,461.0 $1,371.3 11.0 $10,666.0 $1,795.0 16.8Gross profit: New vehicle$547.7 $451.2 $96.5 21.4 $384.0 $67.2 17.5Used vehicle284.8 266.7 18.1 6.8 228.7 38.0 16.6Parts and service970.1 963.2 6.9 0.7 922.2 41.0 4.4Finance and insurance474.5 418.9 55.6 13.3 348.6 70.3 20.2Other26.9 27.5 (0.6) 26.3 1.2 Total gross profit2,304.0 2,127.5 176.5 8.3 1,909.8 217.7 11.4Selling, general, and administrative expenses1,649.4 1,552.1 (97.3) (6.3) 1,446.9 (105.2) (7.3)Depreciation and amortization83.7 76.8 (6.9) 76.7 (0.1) Franchise rights impairment 1.5 1.5 Other expenses (income), net(1.1) 2.0 3.1 (23.3) (25.3) Operating income572.0 496.6 75.4 15.2 408.0 88.6 21.7Floorplan interest expense(42.7) (42.5) (0.2) (35.7) (6.8) Other interest expense(66.0) (56.1) (9.9) (42.6) (13.5) Loss on debt extinguishment(2.2) (19.6) 17.4 (19.6) Gain on senior note repurchases 13.0 (13.0) Interest income0.7 1.4 (0.7) 1.1 0.3 Other gains (losses), net(0.5) 1.5 (2.0) 5.4 (3.9) Income from continuing operations before income taxes$461.3 $381.3 $80.0 21.0 $349.2 $32.1 9.2Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle224,034 206,456 17,578 8.5 182,160 24,296 13.3Used vehicle171,094 160,126 10,968 6.8 133,990 26,136 19.5 395,128 366,582 28,546 7.8 316,150 50,432 16.0Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle$33,472 $32,303 $1,169 3.6 $31,152 $1,151 3.7Used vehicle$17,812 $17,266 $546 3.2 $16,303 $963 5.9Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle$2,445 $2,185 $260 11.9 $2,108 $77 3.7Used vehicle$1,640 $1,612 $28 1.7 $1,670 $(58) (3.5)Finance and insurance$1,201 $1,143 $58 5.1 $1,103 $40 3.629Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2011 (%) 2010 (%) 2009 (%)Revenue mix percentages: New vehicle54.2 53.5 53.2Used vehicle25.4 25.0 23.3Parts and service16.6 17.7 19.8Finance and insurance, net3.4 3.4 3.3Other0.4 0.4 0.4Total100.0 100.0 100.0Gross profit mix percentages: New vehicle23.8 21.2 20.1Used vehicle12.4 12.5 12.0Parts and service42.1 45.3 48.3Finance and insurance20.6 19.7 18.3Other1.1 1.3 1.3Total100.0 100.0 100.0Operating items as a percentage of revenue: Gross profit: New vehicle7.3 6.8 6.8Used vehicle retail9.2 9.3 10.2Parts and service42.3 43.6 43.7Total16.7 17.1 17.9Selling, general and administrative expenses11.9 12.5 13.6Operating income4.1 4.0 3.8Other operating items as a percentage of total gross profit: Selling, general and administrative expenses71.6 73.0 75.8Operating income24.8 23.3 21.4 December 31, 2011 2010 Days supply: New vehicle (industry standard of selling days, including fleet)50 days 63 days Used vehicle (trailing 31 days) (1)31 days 34 days (1) As of December 31, 2011, we have revised our method of calculating used vehicle days supply from a dollar day supply to a unit day supply (including wholesale units).

The Same Store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison, commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us. For example, the results for a dealership acquired in February 2010 would be included only in our same store comparison of 2011 to 2010, not in our same store comparison of 2010 to 2009.

The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers and increased consumer demand, as well as reinstatement or expansion of certain manufacturer leasing programs. The increase in same store unit volume for 2011 was partially offset by the Japan supply constraints, which adversely impacted unit sales in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011, and by a decrease in manufacturer incentives.Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily due to a shift in mix away from import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling prices, toward domestic and premium luxury vehicles. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed also benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for new vehicles in all three segments Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury.Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed benefited from a shift in mix away from import vehicles, which generate relatively lower gross profit per vehicle retailed, due to the tight supply of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers, as well as from an increase in new vehicle gross profit in all three segments. The increase in same store gross profit per vehicle retailed was partially offset by a decrease in certain performance based manufacturer incentives primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold as compared to the prior year. These incentives favorably impacted gross profit by $8.0 million in 2011, compared to $13.1 million in 2010. We were able to recognize these incentives due to our achievement of certain manufacturer incentive program goals during 2011 and 2010. 33Table of ContentsSee Market Conditions above for a discussion of the automotive retail environment, including our expectations regarding gross profit per vehicle retailed in 2012. 2010 compared to 2009 Same store new vehicle revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of an increase in same store unit volume and an increase in same store revenue per new vehicle retailed. The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers, the reinstatement or expansion of certain manufacturer leasing programs, and an increase in consumer confidence.Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for new vehicles in all three segments Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury primarily due to improved market conditions. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed also benefited from a shift in mix toward large vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices.Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due in part to a recovery in margins for both small and large vehicles in all three segments as a result of improved market conditions. Additionally, we achieved certain manufacturer incentive program goals during the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result, we were able to recognize certain performance based manufacturer incentives, primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold, which favorably impacted gross profit by $13.1 million and operating income by $11.8 million. New Vehicle InventoriesOur new vehicle inventories were $1.4 billion or 50 days supply at December 31, 2011, as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.5 billion or 63 days supply at December 31, 2010.

The increase in used vehicle sales volume was driven in part by an increase in sales of value priced vehicles. We opened 19 Value Vehicle Outlets (VVOs) primarily in the second half of 2010 and an additional 8 in 2011 to address industry supply constraints and meet market demand. Through our VVOs, which are located on existing store facilities, we sell vehicles that we would have traditionally 35Table of Contentswholesaled with an average retail price lower than that of used vehicles we typically retail. Additionally, used vehicle sales volumes benefited from an increase in trade in volume associated with the increase in new vehicle sales volume. These increases were partially offset by a decline in certified pre owned vehicle sales.Same store revenue per used vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for used vehicles in the Domestic and Import segments primarily due to tighter supply, which has driven up the wholesale values of used vehicles. Used vehicle supply has been impacted by historically low new vehicle unit sales in recent years, and the decline in off lease vehicles, as well as by customers retaining their vehicles for longer periods of time. The increase in same store revenue per used vehicle retailed was partially offset by a decline in revenues as a result of increased sales of value priced vehicles, which have lower average retail prices than used vehicles we typically retail.Same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, due to modest increases in the first half of 2011, primarily due to temporarily elevated used vehicle values driven by Japanese new vehicle supply constraints. These increases were partially offset by declines in the second half of 2011 related to the liquidation of additional inventory acquired in the second quarter of 2011 when the timeline for the Japanese disruption in new vehicle inventory was anticipated to be longer. The increase in same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed was also partially offset by increased sales of value priced vehicles, which generate a relatively lower gross profit per vehicle retailed than used vehicles we typically retail.2010 compared to 2009 Same store retail used vehicle revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of both an increase in same store unit volume and an increase in same store revenue per used vehicle retailed. The increase in used vehicle sales volume was driven in part by improved market conditions, including improved credit availability offered to consumers and an increase in consumer confidence. Additionally, used vehicle sales volumes benefited from an increase in trade in volume associated with the increase in new vehicle sales volume.Same store revenue per used vehicle retailed benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have a higher average selling price than domestic and import vehicles, as well as an increase in the average selling prices for used vehicles in all three segments.

Additionally, in 2010, warranty gross profit benefited from an increase in warranty service related to the rise of manufacturer recalls in the automotive industry. Customer pay service gross profit benefited from improved market conditions and better marketing of products and services in the service department.

Additionally, new vehicle unit volume in the prior year was adversely impacted by customer uncertainty surrounding the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies.Revenue per new and used vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for both small and large vehicles. New and used revenue and unit sales increased for both Ford and General Motors as compared to the prior year.Domestic segment income increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in new and used unit volume and a recovery in new vehicle margins for both small and large vehicles as a result of improved market conditions. Domestic segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to higher new and used vehicle sales. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses.In the second quarter of 2009, each of Chrysler and General Motors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the bankruptcies, we closed certain Chrysler and General Motors dealerships, the operating results of which were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.40Table of ContentsImportThe Import segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31,($ in millions)2011 2010 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %VarianceRevenue$5,121.0 $4,708.4 $412.6 8.8 $4,103.8 $604.6 14.7Segment income$240.3 $199.5 $40.8 20.5 $175.4 $24.1 13.7Retail new vehicle unit sales108,128 107,580 548 0.5 97,538 10,042 10.32011 compared to 2010 Import revenue increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, due to an increase in used unit volume, primarily due to the recent acquisitions we completed in the third quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, and an increase in revenue per new and used vehicle retailed. Revenue per new and used vehicle retailed benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for both new and used vehicles, due in part to the Japan supply constraints.Import segment income increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily due to the effect of the recent acquisitions noted above, as well as an increase in used unit volume and new and used vehicle gross profit due to the Japan supply constraints. Import segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. Increases in Import segment income were partially offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher new and used vehicle gross profit.See Market Conditions above for a discussion of the automotive retail environment, including our expectations regarding gross profit per vehicle retailed in 2012.2010 compared to 2009 Import revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due to an increase in new and used unit volume and an increase in revenue per new and used vehicle retailed.

Increases in Import segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses.41Table of ContentsPremium LuxuryThe Premium Luxury segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31,($ in millions)2011 2010 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) %Variance 2009 VarianceFavorable /(Unfavorable) % VarianceRevenue$3,908.7 $3,509.0 $399.7 11.4 $3,073.1 $435.9 14.2Segment income$230.9 $208.4 $22.5 10.8 $175.5 $32.9 18.7Retail new vehicle unit sales39,571 34,559 5,012 14.5 32,091 2,468 7.72011 compared to 2010 Premium Luxury revenue increased during 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to an increase in new and used unit volume and an increase in revenue per new vehicle retailed. The increases in new and used unit volume and revenue per new vehicle retailed was primarily due to improved market conditions, including increased consumer demand. Premium Luxury segment income increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in new unit volume and supply and demand imbalances for vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers as a result of the Japan supply constraints. Premium Luxury segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit. The increases in Premium Luxury segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses, as well as by a decrease in certain performance based manufacturer incentives as compared to the prior year. As noted above in the New Vehicle section, we achieved certain manufacturer incentive program goals during 2011 and 2010. See Market Conditions above for a discussion of the automotive retail environment, including our expectations regarding gross profit per vehicle retailed in 2012.2010 compared to 2009 Premium Luxury revenue increased during 2010, as compared to 2009, due to an increase in new and used unit volume and an increase in revenue per new and used vehicle retailed.

Premium Luxury segment income also benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to higher new and used vehicle sales. Additionally, as noted above in New Vehicle section, we achieved certain manufacturer incentive program goals during the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result, we were able to recognize certain performance based manufacturer incentives, primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold, which favorably impacted Premium Luxury segment income. Increases in Premium Luxury segment income were partially offset by an increase in volume related expenses.42Table of ContentsSelling, General, and Administrative ExpensesOur Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (SG&A) consist primarily of compensation, including salaries, commissions and incentive based compensation, as well as advertising (net of reimbursement based manufacturer advertising rebates), occupancy costs, legal, accounting, and professional services, and general corporate expenses.

As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 71.6% in 2011 from 73.0% in 2010 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure and improved gross profit.2010 compared to 2009 SG&A expenses increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a volume driven increase in compensation expense and a $20.0 million increase in gross advertising expenditures, partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 73.0% in 2010 from 75.8% in 2009 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure and improved gross profit.Non Operating Income (Expenses)Floorplan Interest ExpenseFloorplan interest expense was $42.7 million in 2011, $42.5 million in 2010, and $35.7 million in 2009.2011 compared to 2010 The increase in floorplan interest expense of $0.2 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances, partially offset by lower floorplan interest rates.2010 compared to 2009 The increase in floorplan interest expense of $6.8 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances.43Table of ContentsOther Interest ExpenseOther interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, mortgage facility, and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $66.0 million in 2011, $56.1 million in 2010, and $42.6 million in 2009.2011 compared to 2010 The increase in other interest expense of $9.9 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, was primarily due to a $10.7 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and revolving credit facilities, and a $1.2 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates on our prior term loan facility due 2014 . These increases were partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease due to lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, 7% Senior Notes due 2014, and mortgage facility.2010 compared to 2009 The increase in other interest expense of $13.5 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and revolving credit facilities, and a $3.6 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates on our prior term loan facility due 2014. These increases were partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease due to lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, 7% Senior Notes due 2014, and mortgage facility.Loss on Debt ExtinguishmentWe expensed $2.2 million pre tax in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $19.6 million pre tax in the second quarter of 2010 related to certain debt refinancing transactions that we completed in each respective period. These expenses included $0.4 million during 2011 and $3.5 million during 2010 for the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs. These expenses are recorded in Loss on Debt Extinguishment in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements.Gain on Senior Note RepurchasesDuring 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013, and $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements.Provision for Income TaxesIncome taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix.Our effective income tax rate was 38.4% in 2011, and reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with an accounting standard related to unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2012.Our effective income tax rate was 38.3% in 2010, and reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. Our effective income tax rate was 33.2% in 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the elimination of a deferred tax liability of $12.7 million, which was reflected as a benefit in our tax provision for the three months ended December 31, 2009.Discontinued OperationsDiscontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated, that we have entered into an agreement to sell or terminate, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction or termination to be probable, with no material 44Table of Contentschanges expected. We account for a store that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale as a discontinued operation if (a) the operations and cash flows of the store have been (or will be) eliminated from our ongoing operations and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the store after the disposal transaction.In evaluating whether a stores cash flows will be eliminated from our ongoing operations, we consider whether we expect to continue to generate revenues or incur expenses from the sale of similar products or services to customers of the disposed store in the same geographic market. If we believe that a significant portion of the cash flows previously generated by the disposed store will migrate to our other operating stores, we will not treat the disposition as a discontinued operation.We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $2.8 million in 2011, net of income taxes, primarily related to carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that have been closed, as well as expected losses on real estate to be sold. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $8.7 million in 2010, and $35.1 million in 2009, net of income taxes, primarily related to operational losses for stores that were classified as discontinued operations, as well as carrying costs for real estate not yet sold related to stores that had been closed. During 2009, we recorded in discontinued operations estimated losses associated with the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcies of approximately $11 million (after tax), including expected losses on the disposition of real estate. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future.Debt Refinancing TransactionsIn the second quarter of 2010, we (1) completed cash tender offers to purchase any and all of our then outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Notes due 2014 (these two series of notes are referred to as the old notes), pursuant to which we accepted for payment, and thereafter cancelled, all of our outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 88.9% of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014, representing an aggregate amount of $264.0 million of old notes, (2) amended the indenture for the old notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to shorten the notice periods required to undertake an optional redemption, (3) issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, and (4) amended and extended our then existing credit agreement. We expensed $19.6 million pre tax in the second quarter of 2010, related to these transactions, including $3.5 million for the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the old notes and the credit agreement as it existed prior to its amendment and extension.On December 7, 2011, we entered into a new five year unsecured credit agreement (referred to as our credit agreement or the new credit agreement) with a $500 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The new credit agreement replaced our prior unsecured credit agreement (referred to as the prior credit agreement). The prior credit agreement was terminated concurrently with our entry into the new credit agreement, and the indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from borrowings under the new credit agreement. The maturity date for the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the new credit agreement is December 7, 2016.Our prior credit agreement provided for a $533.4 million term loan facility and a $638.6 million revolving credit facility. The term loan facility under the prior credit agreement was bifurcated into a $54.0 million tranche due July 18, 2012 and a $479.4 million tranche due July 18, 2014. The revolving credit facility under the prior credit agreement was bifurcated into a $57.0 million tranche due July 18, 2012 and a $581.6 million tranche due July 18, 2014.With the new credit agreement, we increased our maximum leverage ratio to 3.75x, compared to 3.25x under the prior credit agreement, and our maximum capitalization ratio to 65.0%, compared to 60.0% under the prior credit agreement.45Table of ContentsSee Credit Agreement below for additional information regarding our credit agreement and Restrictions and Covenants for additional information regarding our financial covenants.We expensed $2.2 million pre tax in the fourth quarter of 2011, related to entering into the new credit agreement, including $0.4 million for the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the prior credit agreement.On February 1, 2012, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after the underwriting discount and transaction fees and expenses, were $344.0 million, and we used the net proceeds to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Interest on the 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2012. At any time prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity offerings of our common stock at 105.5% of principal. These notes will mature on February 1, 2020.Available Liquidity ResourcesWe had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:(In millions)December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010Cash and Cash Equivalents$86.6 $95.1Revolving Credit Facility(1)$648.5 $398.9Secured Used Floorplan Facilities(2)$75.4 $70.6(1) Based on aggregate borrowings outstanding of $495.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $56.5 million at December 31, 2011, and aggregate borrowings outstanding of $180.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $59.7 million at December 31, 2010. See Long Term Debt Credit Agreement for additional information.(2) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Long Term Debt Vehicle Floorplan Payable for additional information.In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2011, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $90.0 million, including the $56.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.In February 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscriptions rights, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, and units. Our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, issued in April 2010, and our 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020, issued in February 2012, were offered pursuant to this shelf registration statement.Capital AllocationWe use our capital resources to make capital investments in our business, to complete dealership acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock and or debt. During 2011, based on an anticipated industry recovery over the next several years, our operating performance and confidence in our financial and operational strength, and the additional liquidity and financial flexibility that we obtained as a result of our 2010 and 2011 debt refinancings (see Debt Refinancing Transactions above), we opportunistically allocated capital resources for both share repurchases and acquisition activities, as well as additional capital expenditures, as outlined below.46Table of ContentsShare RepurchasesA summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows:(In millions, except per share data)2011 2010 2009Shares repurchased17.1 26.6 7.7Aggregate purchase price$583.4 $523.7 $135.7Average purchase price per share$34.14 $19.70 $17.74The decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our 3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt.In January 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program. From January 1, 2012 through February 8, 2012, we repurchased an additional 3.9 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $134.8 million (average purchase price per share of $34.89). As of February 8, 2012, $265.0 million remained available for share repurchases under the program.Senior Note RepurchasesThe following table sets forth information regarding our debt repurchases over the past three years:(In millions)2011 2010 2009Aggregate principal amount repurchased: Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013$ $ $48.47% Senior Notes due 2014 40.06.75% Senior Notes due 2018 Total$ $ $88.4We may from time to time repurchase our outstanding senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt is based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.See Debt Refinancing Transactions above for information regarding certain refinancing transactions that we completed during the second quarter of 2010, the fourth quarter of 2011, and the first quarter of 2012.Capital ExpendituresThe following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years:(In millions)2011 2010 2009Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy outs (1)$158.1 $161.8 $75.4(1) Includes accrued construction in progress and excludes property acquired under capital leases.Excluding land purchased for future sites and lease buy outs, and net of related asset sales, we anticipate that our capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $145 million in 2012 primarily related to our store facilities.47Table of ContentsAcquisitions and DivestituresThe following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years:(In millions)2011 2010 2009Cash received from (used in) business acquisitions, net$(64.2) $(73.1) $(0.2)Cash received from (used in) business divestitures, net$4.9 $13.0 $65.9We acquired one automotive retail franchise and related assets during 2011, compared to five in 2010 and one in 2009.

Interest on the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. At any time prior to April 15, 2013, we may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity offerings of our common stock at 106.75% of principal. These notes will mature on April 15, 2018.At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding $14.7 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2014. Interest on the 7% Senior Notes due 2014 is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. These notes will mature on April 15, 2014, and may be redeemed by us currently at 101.75% of principal and at 100% of principal on or after April 15, 2012.During 2009, we repurchased $48.4 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 for an aggregate total consideration of $41.1 million. We also repurchased $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014 for an aggregate total consideration of $34.5 million. We recorded a gain of $13.0 million during 2009 in connection with these repurchases, net of the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs. The gain is classified as Gain on Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements.48Table of ContentsThe 7% Senior Notes due 2014, the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, and the 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.Credit AgreementUnder our credit agreement, we have a $500.0 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The term loan and revolving credit facilities under the credit agreement mature on December 7, 2016.As of December 31, 2011, we had borrowings outstanding of $495.0 million under the revolving credit facility. We have a $200 million letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $56.5 million at December 31, 2011. Our additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $648.5 million at December 31, 2011.Funds borrowed under our credit agreement may be used to repay indebtedness, finance acquisitions and for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes.Our term loan facility provides for various interest rates generally at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Our revolving credit facility provides for a 0.30% facility fee and various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 1.75%.The credit spread charged for both the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility is affected by our leverage ratio. For instance, an increase in our leverage ratio from greater than or equal to 2.0x but less than 3.25x to greater than or equal to 3.25x would result in a 25 basis point increase in the credit spread under both our term loan facility and revolving credit facility.Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.Vehicle Floorplan PayableVehicle floorplan payable trade totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries.Vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled $536.5 million at December 31, 2011, and $486.5 million at December 31, 2010, and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders, as well as amounts borrowed under our secured used floorplan facilities, which are primarily collateralized by used vehicle inventories and related receivables. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate capacity under our used floorplan facilities was $260.0 million. As of that date, $112.7 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $147.3 million was limited to $75.4 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral.At December 31, 2010, the aggregate capacity under our used floorplan facilities was $170.0 million. As of that date, $89.0 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $81.0 million was limited to $70.6 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral.All the vehicle floorplan facilities utilize LIBOR based interest rates. Vehicle floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new vehicle floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Vehicle floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables.Other DebtAt December 31, 2011, we had $211.5 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiary. The mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in November 2007 to provide a fixed interest rate (5.864%) and provide financing secured by 10 year mortgages on certain of our store properties. The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Repayment of the mortgage facility is subject to a prepayment penalty.49Table of ContentsIn 2000, we sold our corporate headquarters facility and leased it back in a transaction that was originally accounted for as a financing. During the first quarter of 2009, we amended this lease, resulting in a change in accounting method from financing to sale leaseback. As a result of this change, we derecognized $21.4 million of assets and a $37.5 million financing liability in the first quarter of 2009, when we also recognized a $7.6 million gain on the sale, which is recorded in Other Expenses (Income), Net, and $1.8 million of rent expense, which is recorded in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The remaining gain of $8.5 million and remaining rent expense of $9.1 million were fully recognized through the third quarter of 2009.Restrictions and CovenantsOur credit agreement, the indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities.Under our prior credit agreement we were, and under our new credit agreement we are, required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under the new credit agreement, the maximum capitalization ratio is 65.0%, compared to 60.0% under the prior credit agreement, and the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x, compared to 3.25x under the prior credit agreement. In calculating our leverage ratio, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million), and, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2011 plus $1.52 billion. The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our new credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8 K on December 8, 2011.The indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions, but do not contain restricted payments covenants or debt incurrence restrictions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage.Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation.As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our new credit agreement, at December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows: December 31, 2011 Requirement Actual Leverage ratio&lt; 3.75x 2.59xCapitalization ratio&lt; 65.0% 50.9%Both the leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional vehicle floorplan indebtedness.In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the new credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur.50Table of ContentsCash FlowsThe following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:($ in millions)Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009Net cash provided by operating activities$376.4 $251.8 $369.3Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(206.2) $(200.2) $14.0Net cash used in financing activities$(178.7) $(130.0) $(319.9)Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts in transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable trade, personnel related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties.2011 compared to 2010 During 2011, we paid $14.8 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities reflect $1.8 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities, discussed below, reflect $13.0 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the new credit agreement.Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings.2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, we paid $28.1 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness, including debt tender premiums. Cash flows from operating activities reflect $16.1 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to these transactions. In addition, we charged to expense $3.5 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities, discussed below, reflect $11.9 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt arrangements.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements and debt refinancing costs noted above.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions.We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. Excluding land purchased for future sites and lease buy outs, and net of related asset sales, we project that 2012 capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $145 million.2011 compared to 2010 Net cash used in investing activities increased during 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in cash received from business divestitures and a decrease in proceeds from property dispositions, partially offset by a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions. 51Table of Contents2010 compared to 2009 We had net cash used in investing activities during 2010, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in 2009, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During 2010, we acquired five automotive retail franchises and other related assets as compared to one in 2009. Net cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by a decrease in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade, and stock option exercises.2011 compared to 2010 During 2011, we repurchased 17.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $583.4 million (average purchase price per share of $34.14), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2011. During 2011, 59,452 shares were surrendered to AutoNation primarily to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.During 2010, we repurchased 26.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $523.7 million (average purchase price per share of $19.70), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2010. Additionally, 36,614 shares were surrendered to AutoNation to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.During 2011, we entered into a new five year unsecured credit agreement with a $500 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The new credit agreement replaced our prior unsecured credit agreement. The prior credit agreement was terminated concurrently with our entry into the new credit agreement, and the indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from borrowings under the new credit agreement. As noted above under Cash Flows from Operating Activities, cash flows from financing activities reflect cash payments of $13.0 million for debt issuance costs that will be amortized to expense over the term of the new credit agreement.During 2010, we (1) accepted for payment, and thereafter cancelled, all of our outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 88.9% of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014, representing an aggregate principal amount of $264.0 million of old notes, (2) amended the indenture for the old notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to shorten the notice periods required to undertake an optional redemption, (3) closed the debt offering and issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, and (4) amended and extended our then existing credit agreement. The 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 were sold at 98.488% of the aggregate principal amount providing for a yield to maturity of 7.0%.A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 was used (1) to pay approximately $274.5 million for the old notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment (which included accrued and unpaid interest for the old notes, as well as consent payments for those that were tendered and accepted for payment by April 13, 2010), (2) to reduce the size of our term loan facility by approximately $66.6 million (from $600.0 million to $533.4 million), (3) to pay transaction fees and expenses related to the 2010 debt offering, the tender offers, and the amendment to then existing credit agreement, and (4) for general corporate purposes. As noted above under Cash Flows from Operating Activities, cash flows from financing activities in 2010 reflect cash payments of $11.9 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to expense over the term of the related debt arrangements.During 2011, we borrowed $940.0 million and repaid $625.0 million under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $315.0 million. During 2010, we borrowed $305.0 million and repaid $125.0 million under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $180.0 million. We did not repurchase any of our senior notes during 2011 or 2010. During 2009, we repurchased $88.4 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Notes due 2014 for an aggregate total consideration of $75.6 million (including $1.2 million of accrued interest).52Table of ContentsCash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable non trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling net proceeds of $40.1 million during 2011 compared to net proceeds of $117.0 million in 2010.During 2011, cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and an increase in the related excess tax benefit from stock based awards as compared to 2010.2010 compared to 2009 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the 2010 debt refinancing noted above, as well as an increase in net proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable non trade, and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Contractual Payment ObligationsThe following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period(In millions)Total Less Than 1Year(2012) 1 3 Years(2013 and2014) 3 5 Years(2015 and2016) More Than 5Years(2017 andthereafter)Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3)(1)$1,898.8 $1,898.8 $ $ $Long term debt, including capital leases (Note 7)(1)1,647.0 12.6 52.1 1,015.4 566.9Interest payments(2)254.9 42.6 82.0 76.5 53.8Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8)(3)456.9 47.1 80.1 65.5 264.2Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11)(1)5.2 0.5 1.2 3.5Deferred compensation obligations(4)34.1 2.0 32.1Estimated liability for chargebacks (Note 19)(5)46.2 26.0 18.0 2.1 0.1Estimated liability for self insurance obligations(6)58.2 23.6 21.0 8.7 4.9Purchase obligations117.2 64.2 52.8 0.1 0.1Total$4,518.5 $2,117.4 $307.2 $1,168.3 $925.6(1) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Primarily represents scheduled interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes and mortgage facility. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded.(3) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2011, these charges totaled approximately $22 million. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(4) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments expected beyond one year, long term obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years column.(5) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments can be estimated based on historical patterns.(6) Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. These amounts are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns.In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2011, surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash 53Table of Contentsdeposits totaled $90.0 million, of which $56.5 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit.As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K.Forward Looking StatementsOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including statements regarding our expectations for the automotive retail industry, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Words such as anticipate, expect, intend, goal, plan, believe, continue, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Our forward looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following:The automotive retail industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict.Our results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and or Europe.Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations.We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises.Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non cash write down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity.Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive and marketing programs of vehicle manufacturers.Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business.We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores.54Table of ContentsWe are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects.Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer.We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and term loan facility that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. These stockholders are represented on our Board of Directors and, therefore, may also have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our Board. In addition, future share repurchases and purchases by our affiliates could further reduce our public float and could adversely impact the liquidity of our common stock.A failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate RiskOur primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions. We had $1.9 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payable at December 31, 2011, and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $19.0 million in 2011 and $18.7 million in 2010 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates.We had $1.0 billion of other variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, and $713.4 million at December 31, 2010. Based on the amounts outstanding at year end, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to annual interest expense of $10.0 million in 2011 and $7.1 million in 2010.Our fixed rate debt, consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes, mortgages, and capital leases, totaled $652.0 million and had a fair value of $675.6 million as of December 31, 2011, and totaled $635.3 million and had a fair value of $644.1 million as of December 31, 2010.55Table of Contents
