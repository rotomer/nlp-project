ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year were $466.6 million, an increase of 6% from $439.4 million for the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating income was $128.6 million compared to $124.1 million last year. A&F recorded its 38th consecutive quarter of record earnings as net income increased to $79.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to $77.2 million last year. Earnings per diluted share were $.78, up 3% from $.76 last year. Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion last year. Operating income for the year increased 7% to $271.5 million from $253.7 million in 2000. Net income per diluted share was $1.65 compared to $1.55 a year ago, an increase of 6%. The following data represents the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last 3 fiscal years expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2001 2000 1999 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 59.1 58.8 56.3 GROSS INCOME 40.9 41.2 43.7 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 21.0 20.7 20.2 OPERATING INCOME 19.9 20.5 23.5 Interest Income, Net (0.4) (0.6) (0.7) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 20.3 21.1 24.2 Provision for Income Taxes 7.9 8.3 9.7 NET INCOME 12.4 12.8 14.5 10 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2001 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2000 and 1999: % Change 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 2000 1999 Net sales (millions) $1,364.9 $1,237.6 $1,030.9 10% 20% Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales (9%) (7%) 10% Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 19% 27% 18% Retail sales per average gross square foot $ 401 $ 474 $ 505 (15%) (6%) Retail sales per average store (thousands) $ 3,095 $ 3,944 $ 4,487 (22%) (12%) Average store size at year end (gross square feet) 7,480 8,047 8,695 (7%) (7%) Gross square feet at year end (thousands) 3,673 2,849 2,174 29% 31% Number of stores: Beginning of year 354 250 196 Opened 138 104 54 Closed (1) End of year 491 354 250 NET SALES Fourth quarter 2001 net sales increased 6% to $466.6 million from $439.4 million in 2000. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales as compared with last years 13 week period ended February 3, 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 was highly promotional and a number of promotional strategies, including direct mail, bouncebacks and selective price point reductions, were employed to improve the sales trend from the previous quarter. Although total Company comparable store sales remained negative, the addition of new and noncomparable store sales resulted in an addition to net sales of $63.6 million. The decrease in comparable store sales amounted to a $35.6 million decrease in net sales and was primarily due to continued weakness in the mens business. Comparable store sales were roughly flat in the womens business for the quarter. Stronger performing categories were in graphic knits, denim, skirts and womens accessories. Mens comparable store sales decreased in the mid teens for the quarter; however, denim and knits performed well. The kids business followed a similar trend to the adult business with girls comparable store sales much stronger than boys. The adult e commerce business continued to become a larger part of the business as Internet sales grew by over 27% during the fourth quarter compared to last year. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites accounted for 4.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to 5.0% in 2000. The decrease is primarily due to the Company not producing an A&F Quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2001. 11 Fourth quarter 2000 net sales increased 21% to $439.4 million from $363.7 million in 1999. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales. The addition of new and noncomparable store sales resulted in an addition to net sales of $98.4 million. The decline in comparable store sales, based on a 14 week quarter for both 2000 and 1999, totaled $30.9 million and was primarily due to comparable store sales decreases in the mens graphic tees and pants departments due to the difficulty in anniversarying paratroop pants. Comparable store sales were positive in the womens business for the quarter based on strong increases in the sweaters, denim and outerwear departments. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2000 as compared to 3.8% in 1999. Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in 2000. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 137 stores offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. The addition of new and noncomparable store sales resulted in an addition to net sales of $215.4 million. The decline in comparable store sales, as compared with last years 52 week period ended February 3, 2001, amounted to $98.9 million and was mostly due to continued weakness in the mens business. Mens comparable store sales decreased in the high teens for the year; however, denim, knits and gymwear performed well. Comparable store sales were up in the mid single digits in the womens business for the year. The strongest performing categories were in denim, knits, skirts, gymwear and womens accessories. Overall, the womens business has increased to become a larger percentage of the overall business and the trend is expected to continue. In fiscal 2001, the womens business accounted for 55% of the total adult business. The kids business had a mid teen decline in comparable store sales for the year with girls performing better than boys. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.2% of 2001 net sales compared to 3.8% last year. Operating improvements in e commerce fulfillment helped reduce the number of backorders, increasing sales by improving in stocks. The Company produced only three A&F Quarterlys in fiscal 2001 versus four in 2000, dampening the increase over last year in the direct business. Net sales for the 2000 fiscal year increased 20% to $1.24 billion from $1.03 billion in 1999. The sales increase was attributable to the addition of 104 stores offset by a 7% comparable store sales decrease. The addition of new and noncomparable store sales resulted in an increase to net sales of $255.4 million. The decline in comparable store sales, based on a 53 week fiscal year for both 2000 and 1999, totaled $64.9 million and was across both the mens and womens businesses. During the year, the assortment in each business was repositioned to be more balanced and less focused on graphics and included items at key opening price points. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 3.8% of 2000 net sales compared to 2.9% last year. GROSS INCOME The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) during the fourth quarter of 2001 was 44.7%, down from 46.2% for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate, attributable to the expected higher level of promotional business. The planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling at lower average retail prices. For the quarter, average unit retail prices decreased in the low double digits. Additionally, buying and occupancy costs, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. These decreases were partially offset by higher initial markup (IMU) and tight control of inventory. The increase in IMU was a result of continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise, particularly in the womens business. The tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down 30% per gross square foot at year end as compared with last year. These low levels of inventory provided downside profit protection as season end merchandise was significantly lower on a per square foot basis as compared to the same period in 2000. 12 For the fourth quarter of 2000, gross income, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 46.2% from 50.9% for the same period in 1999. The decrease was attributable to lower merchandise margins (representing gross income before the deduction of buying and occupancy costs) due to lower IMU and higher markdowns. The IMU was affected by both a change in sales mix and the planned strategy of offering lower opening price points in key product classifications. For the year, the gross income rate decreased to 40.9% in 2001 from 41.2% in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy costs. Buying and occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of net sales, due to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales. The decrease was almost entirely offset by higher IMU as continued improvements in sourcing merchandise have reduced costs. The other factors in protecting gross income were tight control of inventory, which resulted in disciplined markdown control, and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the Companys continued emphasis on in store operational controls. For the year, the gross income rate decreased to 41.2% in 2000 from 43.7% in 1999. The decrease was attributable to lower merchandise margins, primarily due to lower IMU caused by both a change in sales mix and the planned strategy of offering lower opening price points in key product classifications. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES The fourth quarter general, administrative and store operating expenses rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) improved to 17.1% as compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Company continues to tightly control expenses in both the stores and the home office. These cost controls include limiting headcount additions, reducing home office travel and store payroll hours, and decreasing relocation and recruiting expenses. Savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the e commerce business. During the fourth quarter, productivity in the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was over 50% higher than last year. In the e commerce business, fulfillment costs per order were down by over 10%. Last years general, administrative and store operating expenses were unfavorably affected by one time expenses related to the move to the new distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2000. These savings in general, administrative and store operating expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2001. General, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, were 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000 and 16.4% in the comparable period in 1999. The increase in the percentage was primarily due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in comparable store sales. The increase was also due to planned one time expenses related to the Companys move to a new home office and distribution center. The increases were offset by tightly controlled headcount additions, travel expenses, store payroll hours, outside services and compensation expense related to management bonuses. The general, administrative and store operating expenses rate for the year was 21.0%, 20.7% and 20.2% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The rate increases in 2001 and 2000 were primarily due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in sales volume per average store. The increases were partially offset by the Companys continued focus on discretionary expense controls. 13 OPERATING INCOME The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 27.6% and 19.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2001, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 20.5% for the same periods in 2000. The decline in operating income rate in these periods was primarily due to lower gross income percentages resulting from planned promotional strategies executed in the fourth quarter. Lower general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, partially offset the lower gross income rate in the fourth quarter. For the year, higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, added to the decrease in operating income rate. Operating income, expressed as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% and 20.5% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2000, respectively, compared to 34.5% and 23.5% for the same periods in 1999. The decline in operating income as a percentage of net sales in these periods was primarily a result of lower gross income percentages. Higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, also added to the decrease in the operating income percentage of net sales. INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE Net interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $5.1 million for the 2001 fiscal year compared with net interest income of $2.5 million and $7.8 million for the corresponding periods last year. The decrease in net interest income for both the quarter and the year was due to the decline in interest rates. Net interest income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily from short term investments. Net interest income was $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $7.8 million for all of 2000 compared with net interest income of $2.5 million and $7.3 million for the corresponding periods in 1999. The increase in net interest income for the year was due to an increase in interest rates, which was partially offset by lower cash and equivalents balances. Net interest income in 2000 and 1999 was primarily from short term investments. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Companys continuing growth in net income affords it financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. A summary of the Companys working capital position and capitalization follows (thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Working capital $241,616 $146,939 $162,351 Capitalization Shareholders equity $595,434 $422,700 $311,094 14 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2001 2000 1999 Current ratio (current assets divided by current 2.48 1.94 2.18 liabilities) Cash flow to capital investment (net cash provided by operating activities divided by capital expenditures) 184% 99% 208% Free cash flow (net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) (in thousands) $106,687 ($ 2,292)$ 79,374 Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary resource of liquidity, totaled $233.2 million, $151.2 million and $152.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash was provided primarily by current year net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization. Additionally in 2001, cash was provided from increases in deferred income tax liabilities and accrued expenses and decreases in inventories. Deferred income tax liabilities increased in the current year as a result of increasing differences in tax and book depreciation methods due to the number of stores opened in the past few years. Accrued expenses, including unredeemed gift card revenue and catalogue and advertising costs, increased in the current year as a result of the continued growth and development of the business. Inventories decreased $12.1 million during 2001 due to the tight management of inventory, which resulted in a 30% decrease in inventory per gross square foot at year end. Uses of cash were directly related to store growth and primarily consisted of increases in capitalized store supplies, construction allowance receivables and prepaid rent related to stores (classified in other assets). The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows for investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) and the construction costs of the new office and distribution center. Investing activities also included purchases and maturities of marketable securities. As of February 2, 2002, the Company held marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. Financing activities during 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted primarily of the repurchase of 600,000 shares, 3,550,000 shares and 1,510,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. As of February 2, 2002, A&F is authorized to repurchase up to an additional 1,850,000 shares under the current repurchase program. Financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. The Company has available a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement. No amounts are currently outstanding. Additional details regarding the credit agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 8). The Company also has a $75 million facility for trade letters of credit. The trade letters of credit are issued to numerous overseas suppliers and serve as guarantees to the suppliers. As of February 2, 2002, $39.7 million was outstanding under this trade letter of credit facility. 15 The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $8.5 million. The beneficiaries, two of the Companys suppliers, have the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiaries have not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. As of February 2, 2002, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms of one to fourteen years. These commitments include store leases with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen years. A summary of minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases follows (thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years $822,920 $104,085 $211,270 $198,459 $309,106 STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by division were as follows: February 2, 2002 February 3, 2001 Number of Gross Square Number of Gross Square Stores Feet (thousands) Stores Feet (thousands) Abercrombie & Fitch 309 2,798 265 2,443 abercrombie 148 662 84 375 Hollister Co. 34 213 5 31 Total 491 3,673 354 2,849 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $126.5 million, $153.5 million and $73.4 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Additionally, the noncash accrual for construction in progress totaled $1.0 million, $9.5 million and $10.4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Capital expenditures related to the construction of a new office and distribution center, including the noncash accrual for construction in progress, accounted for approximately $17 million, $92 million and $27 million of total capital expenditures in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The office and distribution center were completed in 2001. The balance of capital expenditures related primarily to new stores. The Company anticipates spending $105 to $115 million in 2002 for capital expenditures, of which $85 to $95 million will be for new stores construction. The balance of expenditures primarily relates to improving the in store information technology structure and improvements in the distribution center. The Company intends to add approximately 815,000 gross square feet in 2002, which will represent a 22% increase over year end 2001. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 40 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 30 abercrombie stores and 60 Hollister Co. stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in 2002 will approximate $600,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $300,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened in 2002 will approximate $500,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $150,000 per store. 16 The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister Co. stores opened in 2002 will approximate $750,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. However, the Company is in the early stages of developing Hollister Co. and, as a result, current average costs for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures are not representative of future costs. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $250,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has available a $150 million credit agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon shipment of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At A&F, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the taking of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent the future anticipated selling prices. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory valuation as it preserves the cost to retail relationship in inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 10 15 years for 17 leasehold improvements and 3 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. ("The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The standard is effective starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 (February 3, 2002 for the Company). SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. Management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 (February 2, 2003 for the Company). The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 (February 3, 2002 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 18 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LIMITED Effective May 19, 1998, The Limited completed a tax free exchange offer to establish A&F as an independent company. Subsequent to the exchange offer (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), A&F and The Limited entered into various service agreements for terms ranging from one to three years. A&F hired associates with the appropriate expertise or contracted with outside parties to replace those services which expired in May 1999. Service agreements were also entered into for the continued use by the Company of its distribution and home office space and transportation and logistic services. The distribution space agreement terminated in April 2001. The home office space and transportation and logistic services agreements expired in May 2001. The cost of these services generally was equal to The Limiteds cost in providing the relevant services plus 5% of such costs. Costs incurred to replace the services provided by The Limited did not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Companys financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2002 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward looking statements included in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash and equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 2, 2002, the Company has no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 19
