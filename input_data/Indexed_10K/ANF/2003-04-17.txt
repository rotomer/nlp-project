ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Suppliers. During fiscal year 2002, the Company purchased merchandise from approximately 186 suppliers and factories located throughout the world. In fiscal year 2002, the Company sourced approximately 9% of its apparel through Koos Manufacturing, 8% through Direct Source Industries and 6% through Wooliston Garment, Inc. In addition to purchases from Koos Manufacturing, Direct Source Industries and Wooliston Garment, Inc., the Company purchased merchandise directly in foreign markets with other vendors. Additional merchandise was purchased in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. Excluding purchases from Koos Manufacturing, Direct Source Industries and Wooliston Garment, Inc., no more than 5% of the merchandise purchased by the Company originated from any single manufacturer. The Company pursues a global sourcing strategy that includes relationships with vendors in over 40 countries. Any event causing a sudden disruption in these sourcing operations, either political or financial, could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. Substantially all of the Companys foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 3 Distribution and Merchandise Inventory. Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Companys stores are shipped to its distribution center in New Albany, Ohio where the merchandise is received and inspected. Merchandise and related materials are distributed to the Companys stores using contract carriers. The Companys policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution center so that it can offer customers a full selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns where required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends. Seasonal Business. The Company views the retail apparel market as having two principal selling seasons, Spring and Fall. As is generally the case in the apparel industry, the Company experiences its peak sales activity during the Fall season. This seasonal sales pattern results in increased inventory during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. During fiscal year 2002, the highest inventory level approximated $221.5 million at the November 2002 month end and the lowest inventory level approximated $132.2 million at the February 2002 month end. Store Operations and Expansion. The Companys stores and point of sale marketing are designed to convey the principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture, fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a shopping experience that is consistent with the Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie or Hollister lifestyle. The Companys sales associates, or brand representatives, are a central element in creating the entertaining, yet comfortable, atmosphere of the stores. In addition to providing a high level of customer service, the brand representatives reflect the casual, energetic attitude of the brand and culture. The Company maintains a uniform appearance throughout its store base, for each concept, in terms of merchandise display and location on the selling floor. Store managers receive detailed store plans that dictate fixture and merchandise placement to ensure uniform execution of the merchandising strategy at the store level. Standardization, by concept, of store design and merchandise presentation also creates a cost savings in store furnishings, maximizes usage and productivity of selling space and allows the Company to efficiently open new stores. Trademarks. The Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister Co. trademarks, and certain other trademarks, either have been registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with registries of many foreign countries. The Company believes that its products are identified by its trademarks and, thus, its trademarks are of significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 20 years and is subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon appropriate application. The Company intends to continue the use of each of its trademarks and to renew each of its registered trademarks. 4 Other Information. Additional information about the Companys business, including its revenues and profits for the last three years, plus gross square footage is set forth under the caption ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. COMPETITION. The sale of apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e commerce is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores and department stores. Fashion, price, service, store location, selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales and on line sales. The Company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e commerce. ASSOCIATE RELATIONS. On March 28, 2003, the Company employed approximately 22,000 associates (none of whom were party to a collective bargaining agreement), approximately 18,700 of whom were part time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the Holiday season. The Company believes its relationship with associates is good. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Companys headquarters and support functions (consisting of office, distribution and shipping facilities) are located in New Albany, Ohio and owned by the Company. All of the retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United States. The leases expire at various dates principally between 2003 and 2015. Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the size and location of the store. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by the tenant. 5 As of February 1, 2003, the Companys 597 stores were located in 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows: Alabama 13 Hawaii 1 Massachusetts 18 New Mexico 2 South Dakota 1 Arizona 11 Idaho 1 Michigan 24 New York 33 Tennessee 15 Arkansas 4 Illinois 33 Minnesota 11 North Carolina 20 Texas 43 California 53 Indiana 19 Mississippi 5 North Dakota 1 Utah 4 Colorado 11 Iowa 3 Missouri 15 Ohio 30 Vermont 2 Connecticut 11 Kansas 7 Montana 2 Oklahoma 8 Virginia 15 Delaware 1 Kentucky 10 Nebraska 4 Oregon 4 Washington 15 District of Columbia 2 Louisiana 11 Nevada 4 Pennsylvania 27 West Virginia 1 Florida 26 Maine 3 New Hampshire 4 Rhode Island 3 Wisconsin 13 Georgia 22 Maryland 7 New Jersey 18 South Carolina 6 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. On January 13, 1999, a complaint was filed against many national retailers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint (1) purported to be filed on behalf of a class of unnamed garment workers, (2) related to labor practices allegedly employed on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel manufacturers unrelated to the Company, some of which have sold goods to the Company, and (3) sought injunctive, unspecified monetary and other relief. On September 29, 1999, the action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Thereafter, the plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint to add A&F and others as additional defendants. That motion was granted and, on April 28, 2000, an amended complaint was filed which added A&F and others as defendants, but did not otherwise substantively alter either the claims alleged or the relief sought by the plaintiffs. A&F joined with other retailer defendants in moving to dismiss the amended complaint. Certain of the other defendants also moved to transfer the action to Saipan. On June 23, 2000, the District Court of Hawaii ordered the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of the Northern Mariana Islands. Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus challenging the transfer and on March 22, 2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying the Petition for Writ of Mandamus, thus allowing the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The defendants motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted was denied in part and granted in part on November 26, 2001. As to the partial granting of the motion, the Court also granted the plaintiffs leave to amend to cure any pleading defects in a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on December 13, 2001 and their second amended complaint, which added neither new parties nor claims but realleged claims previously dismissed, on December 17, 2001. The motion for class certification was heard on February 14, 2002. The motion for preliminary approval of settlement as to certain other retailer defendants was also heard the same date. A motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was heard on March 19, 2002. On May 10, 2002, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to the remaining RICO claim and granted the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to the Common Law Peonage claim, the Anti Peonage statutory claim, and the Alien Tort Claims Act claim. Plaintiffs were given leave to file a third amended complaint. The motions for class certification and preliminary approval of settlement as to certain other retailer defendants were also granted. A third amended complaint was filed on July 25, 2002. This case was recently submitted to the Court for approval of a settlement that includes A&F. The settlement does not involve any admission of wrongdoing and involves no payment by A&F. Conditional approval was granted on October 31, 6 2002 and the fairness hearing was on March 22, 2003. There has been no ruling on the fairness hearing as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. A&F is aware of 20 actions that have been filed against A&F and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of a purported, but as yet uncertified, class of shareholders who purchased A&Fs Class A Common Stock between October 8, 1999 and October 13, 1999. These 20 actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division alleging violations of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages. On April 12, 2000, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued a Transfer Order transferring the 20 pending actions to the Southern District of New York for consolidated pretrial proceedings under the caption In re Abercrombie & Fitch Securities Litigation. On November 16, 2000, the Court signed an Order appointing the Hicks Group, a group of seven unrelated investors in A&Fs securities, as lead plaintiff, and appointing lead counsel in the consolidated action. On December 14, 2000, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Amended Complaint") in which they did not name as defendants Lazard Freres & Co. and Todd Slater, who had formerly been named as defendants in certain of the 20 complaints. A&F and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint on February 14, 2001. A&F is aware of three actions that have been filed where a purported class of employees and former employees of the Company allege that the Company required its associates to wear a "uniform" which in two of the three actions is allegedly in violation of California law. These two complaints were served on February 4, 2003 and February 10, 2003 in the Superior Courts of San Francisco County and Los Angeles County, respectively. In the third action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on March 14, 2003, the "uniform," which when purchased, allegedly drove associates wages below the federal minimum wage. In each claim, the plaintiff, on behalf of his or her class, seeks injunctive relief and economic, liquidated damages in an unspecified amount. A&F believes that the actions against it are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against them. However, A&F does not believe it is feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings. The timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is also uncertain. In addition, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") initiated a formal investigation regarding trading in the securities of A&F and the disclosure of sales forecasts in October 1999, and the Ohio Division of Securities requested information from A&F regarding these same matters. A&F was notified on April 3, 2003 that the SEC investigation has been terminated and no enforcement action has been recommended. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

The payment of any future dividends on shares will be determined by the A&F Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. On March 27, 2003, there were approximately 5,000 shareholders of record. However, when including active associates who participate in A&Fs stock purchase plan, associates who own shares through A&F sponsored retirement plans and others holding shares in broker accounts under street name, A&F estimates the shareholder base at approximately 55,000. 9 ITEM 6.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year were $534.5 million, an increase of 15% from $466.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $149.6 million compared to $128.6 million in 2001. A&F recorded its 42nd consecutive comparable quarter of record earnings as net income increased to $92.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to $79.2 million in 2001. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $.93, up 19% from $.78 in 2001. Net sales for the 2002 fiscal year reached $1.6 billion, an increase of 17% over fiscal 2001 net sales of $1.4 billion. Operating income for the 2002 fiscal year increased 15% to $312.6 million from $271.5 million in fiscal 2001. Net income per diluted share was $1.94 for the 2002 fiscal year compared to $1.65 in 2001, an increase of 18%. The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last 3 fiscal years expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2002 2001 2000 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 58.9 59.1 58.8 GROSS INCOME 41.1 40.9 41.2 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 21.5 21.0 20.7 OPERATING INCOME 19.6 19.9 20.5 Interest Income, Net (0.2) (0.4) (0.6) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.8 20.3 21.1 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.9 8.3 NET INCOME 12.2 12.4 12.8 11 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2002 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2001 and 2000: % Change 2002 2001 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 Net sales (millions) $1,595.8 $1,364.9 $1,237.6 17% 10% Decrease in comparable store sales (5%) (9%) (7%) Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 22% 19% 27% Retail sales per average gross square foot $379 $401 $474 (5%) (15%) Retail sales per average store (thousands) $2,797 $3,095 $3,944 (10%) (22%) Average store size at year end (gross square feet) 7,300 7,480 8,047 (2%) (7%) Gross square feet at year end (thousands) 4,358 3,673 2,849 19% 29% Number of stores and gross square feet by concept: Abercrombie & Fitch: Stores at beginning of period 309 265 215 Opened 33 45 50 Closed (2) (1) Stores at end of period 340 309 265 Gross square feet (thousands) 3,036 2,798 2,443 abercrombie: Stores at beginning of period 148 84 35 Opened 19 64 49 Closed (3) Stores at end of period 164 148 84 Gross square feet (thousands) 727 662 375 Hollister Co.: Stores at beginning of period 34 5 Opened 60 29 5 Closed (1) Stores at end of period 93 34 5 Gross square feet (thousands) 595 213 31 12 NET SALES Fourth Quarter 2002 Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $534.5 million, up 15% over 2001s fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales decreased 4% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps"), defined as sales in stores that have been open for at least one year, for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the mid single digits, with womens posting a positive comp and mens a negative comp. Comps for the kids business, abercrombie, were similar to the adult business with girls posting a positive comp increase during the quarter and boys a negative comp. Comps in Hollister were positive in double digits. By regions, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to strategically use direct mail and bounce back promotions, but, overall, a much less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken compared to 2001. The pre Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected, comp store sales were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December 2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of winter clearance, and positive results from the initial spring assortment. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops, outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there remained no solid trend industry wide. However, knit tops and woven shirts performed well during the quarter. As for the kids business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in the adult business, boys continued to be difficult. In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed best. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001. The Company remains on track to add a Hollister e commerce business for back to school 2003. The direct business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to 4.5% in 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 Fourth quarter 2001 net sales increased 6% to $466.6 million from $439.4 million in 2000. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9% decline in comps as compared with the previous years 13 week period ended February 3, 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 was highly promotional and a number of 13 promotional strategies, including direct mail, bouncebacks and selective price point reductions, were employed to improve the sales trend from the third quarter 2001. By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the high single digits with womens comps roughly flat for the quarter while mens comps were negative double digits. Comps for our kids business followed a similar trend to the adult business with girls comps much stronger than boys comps. By regions, comps were strongest in the Northeast and the West Coast and weakest in the Southeast and Midwest. From a merchandising standpoint, womens outperformed mens and generated strong comp increases in denim, graphic tees and skirts. Newer womens classifications, such as gymwear and lingerie performed well. Mens was difficult with no solid industry wide trend. Similar to womens, mens denim consistently performed well and comps were strong through Christmas. However, mens outerwear and sweater classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, strong girls categories were denim, skirts, knits and accessories while sweaters and outerwear classifications were weak. Boys strong classifications were knits and denim. In the adult e commerce business, sales grew by over 27% during the fourth quarter of 2001 compared to 2000. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites accounted for 4.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to 5.0% in 2000. The decrease is primarily due to the Company not producing an A&F Quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Fiscal 2002 Net sales for fiscal year 2002 reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over fiscal year 2001. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was primarily due to the weak performance in both the mens and boys. Mens comps decreased in low double digits for fiscal year 2002 while boys comps decreased in the mid teens. For Spring 2003, the Company continues to maintain a cautious approach in mens, focusing on delivering more new items more frequently. The mens assortment for spring features a "vintage look" which is emphasized in washes, colors and marketing. As in mens, a cautious approach will be maintained in boys. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for greater than 57% of the adult and kids businesses, respectively, in fiscal year 2002. For the year, womens comps were negative low single digits while girls comps were positive mid single digits. The Company will continue to focus on providing more frequent newness in both womens and girls in 2003. Items will flow into the stores faster and remain in stores for a shorter time period. This strategy gives the customer more new items without an increase in inventory investment. Hollister continued to perform well. For fiscal year 2002, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.7% of 2002 net sales compared to 4.2% in 2001. 14 Fiscal 2001 Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in 2000. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 137 stores offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was largely due to continued weakness in mens. Mens comps decreased in the high teens for the year; however, denim, knits and gymwear performed well. Comps were up in the mid single digits in womens for the 2001 fiscal year. The strongest performing categories were denim, knits, skirts, gymwear and womens accessories. Overall, womens increased as a percentage of the overall business. In fiscal 2001, womens accounted for 55% of the total adult business. In 2001, the kids business had a mid teen decline in comparable store sales for the year with girls performing better than boys. As in the adult business, girls outperformed boys. For the 2001 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 75% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.2% of fiscal 2001 net sales compared to 3.8% of 2000 net sales. Operating improvements in e commerce fulfillment helped reduce the number of backorders, increasing sales by improving in stocks. The Company produced only three A&F Quarterlys in fiscal 2001 versus four in 2000, dampening the increase over the prior year in the direct business. GROSS INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from last years rate of 44.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup (IMU), partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales. Continued progress in sourcing has been an important factor in improving the IMU in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing the IMU in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, the Companys less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges with a comp store decrease. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2002 with inventories up 12% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of 2001 at cost. 15 Fourth Quarter 2001 The gross income rate during the fourth quarter of 2001 was 44.7%, down from 46.2% for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate, attributable to the expected higher level of promotional business. The planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling at lower average retail prices. For the quarter, average unit retail prices decreased in the low double digits. Additionally, buying and occupancy costs, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. These decreases were partially offset by higher IMU and tight control of inventory. The increase in IMU was a result of continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise, particularly in womens. The tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down 30% per gross square foot at year end 2001 as compared with year end 2000. These low levels of inventory provided downside profit protection as season end merchandise was significantly lower on a per square foot basis in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000. Fiscal 2002 For fiscal 2002, the gross income rate was 41.1% versus 40.9% in 2001. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales. Tight control of inventory also protected gross income as the Company chased inventory through most of the first half of 2002. Fiscal 2001 For the 2001 fiscal year, the gross income rate decreased to 40.9% from 41.2% in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy costs. Buying and occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of net sales, due to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales. The decrease was almost entirely offset by higher IMU as a result of continued improvements in sourcing merchandise that reduced costs. The other factors in protecting gross income were tight control of inventory, which resulted in disciplined markdown control, and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the Companys continued emphasis on in store operational controls. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES Fourth Quarter 2002 The fourth quarter 2002 general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 17.5% compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in rate versus 2001 resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2002, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. Store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store expense rate. 16 Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher than the fourth quarter of 2001. For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in 2001 with 20% fewer labor hours. In the fourth quarter of 2002, fulfillment costs per order in the direct business were down by over 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 The fourth quarter 2001 general, administrative and store operating expense rate improved to 17.1% as compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Company continued to tightly control expenses in both the stores and the home office. These cost controls included limiting headcount additions, reducing home office travel and store payroll hours, and decreasing relocation and recruiting expenses. Savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter 2001, productivity in the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was over 50% higher than fourth quarter 2000. In the direct business, fulfillment costs per order were down by over 10%. These savings in general, administrative and store operating expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth quarter 2000s general, administrative and store operating expenses were unfavorably affected by one time expenses related to the move to the new distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2000. Fiscal 2002 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2002 was 21.5% versus 21.0% in 2001. The 2002 rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses. Fiscal 2001 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2001 was 21.0% versus 20.7% in 2000. The rate increase in 2001 was primarily due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in sales volume per average store. The increase was partially offset by the Companys focus on discretionary expense controls. OPERATING INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 28.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 compared to 27.6% for the same period in 2001. Less aggressive promotional activities and higher average selling prices increased the gross income rate in the current years fourth quarter. This improvement was offset somewhat by a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate. 17 Fiscal 2002 The operating income rate for the fiscal year 2002 was 19.6% versus 19.9% in fiscal year 2001. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Fourth Quarter 2001 and Fiscal 2001 The operating income rate was 27.6% and 19.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2001, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 20.5% for the same periods in 2000. The decline in operating income rate in these periods was primarily due to lower gross income percentages resulting from planned promotional strategies executed in the fourth quarter of 2001. Lower general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, partially offset the lower gross income rate in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the year, higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, added to the decrease in operating income rate. INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income were $1.3 and $3.8 million in 2002 as compared with net interest income of $1.2 and $5.1 million for the comparable periods in 2001. The decrease in net interest income in the year to date period was a result of the Companys strategy at the beginning of 2002 to invest cash in tax free securities due to the decline in short term market interest rates. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the commercial paper market. The tax free investments contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 38.5% and 38.4% for the fourth quarter and year to date periods of 2002 as compared to 39.0% for both of 2001s comparable periods. Net interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $5.1 million for the 2001 fiscal year compared with net interest income of $2.5 million and $7.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2000. The decrease in net interest income for both the quarter and the year was due to the decline in market interest rates. Net interest income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily from short term investments. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Companys continuing growth in net income affords it financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. 18 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. A summary of the Companys working capital position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Working capital $389,686 $241,616 $146,939 Capitalization Shareholders equity $749,527 $595,434 $422,700 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2002 2001 2000 Current ratio (current assets divided by current 2.84 2.48 1.94 liabilities) Operating cash flow (in thousands) $293,146 $233,202 $151,189 Net cash provided by operating activities is the Companys primary source of liquidity and has grown steadily the past three years from $151.2 million in 2000 to $233.2 million in 2001 to $293.1 million in 2002. Current year net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization was the primary source of cash. Additionally, in 2002, cash was provided from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in 2002 due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments versus 2001. Accrued expenses increased in 2002 due to the following: higher incentive compensation expenses, resulting from the Companys improved financial performance; higher store expenses and gift card liability, consistent with the increase in store openings; and higher legal expenses. The increase in income taxes payable in the current year was due primarily to a change in the methodology being used to make estimated tax payments throughout 2002. This methodology was modified to more closely reflect interim liabilities under the annualization method. In addition, the favorable impact of the Companys stock based compensation was significantly reduced reflecting the lower stock prices during 2002 as compared to 2001. Net deferred income taxes increased in 2002 primarily as a result of increasing differences between book and tax depreciation methods due to the accelerated growth of store openings the past few years and "bonus" accelerated depreciation allowed under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Inventories increased $35.3 million during 2002 and represented the primary use of cash. Inventories at fiscal 2002 year end were 12% higher on a gross square foot basis versus fiscal 2001 year end. 19 Other uses of cash were directly related to store growth and primarily consisted of increases in capitalized store supplies and prepaid rent related to stores (classified in other current assets). The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows related to investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Investing activities also included purchases and maturities of marketable securities. As of February 1, 2003, the Company held marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. The decrease in note receivable resulted from the repayment of a promissory note by the Chairman (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Financing activities during 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of the repurchase of 1,850,000 shares, 600,000 shares, and 3,550,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The 2002 repurchase completed a previously authorized 6,000,000 share repurchase program. At its August 2002 Board meeting, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5,000,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock. As of February 1, 2003, the total number of shares authorized and available for repurchase was 5,000,000. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. During the first nine months of 2002, the Company had available a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement. The Company also had a $75 million facility for trade letters of credit. The trade letters of credit were issued to numerous overseas suppliers and served as guarantees to the suppliers. Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), which replaced both the then existing credit agreement (the "Old Credit Agreement") and the trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the New Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $41.8 million were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003. Letters of credit totaling approximately $49.9 million were outstanding under the trade letter of credit facility at February 2, 2002. No borrowings were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003 or under the Old Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that expire in one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. 20 As of February 1, 2003, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms of one to fourteen years. These commitments include store leases with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen years. A summary of minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases follows (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years $889,328 $120,313 $352,910 $186,434 $229,671 STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by concept were as follows: February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 Number of Gross Square Number of Gross Square Stores Feet (millions) Stores Feet (millions) Abercrombie & Fitch 340 3,036 309 2,798 abercrombie 164 727 148 662 Hollister Co. 93 595 34 213 Total 597 4,358 491 3,673 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $93.0 million, $126.5 million and $153.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the noncash accrual for construction in progress decreased $12.7 million in 2002 and increased $1.0 million and $9.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2002 related to new store construction with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 related to the construction of a new office and distribution center, including the noncash accrual for construction in progress, accounted for approximately $17 million and $92 million of total capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The office and distribution center were completed in 2001. The balance of capital expenditures related primarily to new stores. The Company anticipates spending $120 to $130 million in 2003 for capital expenditures, of which $70 to $80 million will be for new stores construction. The balance of expenditures primarily relates to improving the in store information technology structure, which should be complete for back to school, and distribution center expansion. In addition, the Company has begun construction planning for additional home office space to accommodate the growth of Hollister. The Company intends to add approximately 726,000 gross square feet for the three concepts in 2003, which will represent a 17% increase over year end 2002. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 30 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 70 new Hollister Co. stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in 2003 will approximate $630,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $330,000 per store. 21 The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened in 2003 will approximate $485,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $130,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister Co. stores opened in 2003 will approximate $650,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $230,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its credit agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At A&F, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory valuation as it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. 22 Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 10 15 years for leasehold improvements and 3 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The standard was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. The standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. 23 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34," that requires recognition of a liability (at fair value) for guarantee contracts that have any of the following characteristics: Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on changes in an underlying, as defined by SFAS No. 133; Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligating agreement; Indemnification agreements; Indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. In addition to the disclosures required by current GAAP related to guarantees, this interpretation requires additional disclosures including: Details about the nature of the guarantee; The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted); The current carrying amount of the liability for guarantors obligation under the guarantee; The nature of any recourse provisions. Guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 must follow the new accounting. The disclosure requirements were effective for the 2002 financial statements and did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. The recognition provisions will be adopted by the Company in 2003 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard rescinds FASB Statements No. 4 and 64 that deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of debt. The standard also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44 that deals with intangible assets of motor carriers. The standard modifies FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," so that certain capital lease modifications must be accounted for by lessees as sale leaseback transactions. Additionally, the standard identifies amendments that should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally amends the appropriate pronouncements. The provisions of this standard related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are in effect in 2003. The remaining provisions of the statement were adopted by the Company for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred. The provisions of the standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment to FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that choose to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," will be permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified prospective, and retroactive restatement). 24 Companies that choose not to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 will be affected by the new disclosure requirements of FASB No. 148. The new disclosures include tabular presentation of the following information for all periods presented: 1. Net income and EPS (basic and diluted), as reported; 2. Compensation expense (if any), net of tax, included in reported net income; 3. Compensation expense that would have been included in net income had the company adopted the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 for all awards granted, modified or settled since December 15, 1994; 4. Pro forma net income and earnings per share. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FASB No. 148 are effective for the 2002 financial statements. The new interim disclosure provisions are effective in the first quarter of 2003. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor," addresses the accounting treatment for cash vendor allowances received. The adoption of EITF Issue 02 16 in 2003 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Companys financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward looking statements included in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates. 25 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash and equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 1, 2003, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 26 
 
ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. COMPETITION. The sale of apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e commerce is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores and department stores. Fashion, price, service, store location, selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales and on line sales. The Company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e commerce. ASSOCIATE RELATIONS. On March 28, 2003, the Company employed approximately 22,000 associates (none of whom were party to a collective bargaining agreement), approximately 18,700 of whom were part time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the Holiday season. The Company believes its relationship with associates is good. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Companys headquarters and support functions (consisting of office, distribution and shipping facilities) are located in New Albany, Ohio and owned by the Company. All of the retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United States. The leases expire at various dates principally between 2003 and 2015. Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the size and location of the store. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by the tenant. 5 As of February 1, 2003, the Companys 597 stores were located in 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows: Alabama 13 Hawaii 1 Massachusetts 18 New Mexico 2 South Dakota 1 Arizona 11 Idaho 1 Michigan 24 New York 33 Tennessee 15 Arkansas 4 Illinois 33 Minnesota 11 North Carolina 20 Texas 43 California 53 Indiana 19 Mississippi 5 North Dakota 1 Utah 4 Colorado 11 Iowa 3 Missouri 15 Ohio 30 Vermont 2 Connecticut 11 Kansas 7 Montana 2 Oklahoma 8 Virginia 15 Delaware 1 Kentucky 10 Nebraska 4 Oregon 4 Washington 15 District of Columbia 2 Louisiana 11 Nevada 4 Pennsylvania 27 West Virginia 1 Florida 26 Maine 3 New Hampshire 4 Rhode Island 3 Wisconsin 13 Georgia 22 Maryland 7 New Jersey 18 South Carolina 6 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. On January 13, 1999, a complaint was filed against many national retailers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint (1) purported to be filed on behalf of a class of unnamed garment workers, (2) related to labor practices allegedly employed on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel manufacturers unrelated to the Company, some of which have sold goods to the Company, and (3) sought injunctive, unspecified monetary and other relief. On September 29, 1999, the action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Thereafter, the plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint to add A&F and others as additional defendants. That motion was granted and, on April 28, 2000, an amended complaint was filed which added A&F and others as defendants, but did not otherwise substantively alter either the claims alleged or the relief sought by the plaintiffs. A&F joined with other retailer defendants in moving to dismiss the amended complaint. Certain of the other defendants also moved to transfer the action to Saipan. On June 23, 2000, the District Court of Hawaii ordered the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of the Northern Mariana Islands. Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus challenging the transfer and on March 22, 2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying the Petition for Writ of Mandamus, thus allowing the case to be transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The defendants motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted was denied in part and granted in part on November 26, 2001. As to the partial granting of the motion, the Court also granted the plaintiffs leave to amend to cure any pleading defects in a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on December 13, 2001 and their second amended complaint, which added neither new parties nor claims but realleged claims previously dismissed, on December 17, 2001. The motion for class certification was heard on February 14, 2002. The motion for preliminary approval of settlement as to certain other retailer defendants was also heard the same date. A motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was heard on March 19, 2002. On May 10, 2002, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to the remaining RICO claim and granted the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to the Common Law Peonage claim, the Anti Peonage statutory claim, and the Alien Tort Claims Act claim. Plaintiffs were given leave to file a third amended complaint. The motions for class certification and preliminary approval of settlement as to certain other retailer defendants were also granted. A third amended complaint was filed on July 25, 2002. This case was recently submitted to the Court for approval of a settlement that includes A&F. The settlement does not involve any admission of wrongdoing and involves no payment by A&F. Conditional approval was granted on October 31, 6 2002 and the fairness hearing was on March 22, 2003. There has been no ruling on the fairness hearing as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. A&F is aware of 20 actions that have been filed against A&F and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of a purported, but as yet uncertified, class of shareholders who purchased A&Fs Class A Common Stock between October 8, 1999 and October 13, 1999. These 20 actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division alleging violations of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages. On April 12, 2000, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued a Transfer Order transferring the 20 pending actions to the Southern District of New York for consolidated pretrial proceedings under the caption In re Abercrombie & Fitch Securities Litigation. On November 16, 2000, the Court signed an Order appointing the Hicks Group, a group of seven unrelated investors in A&Fs securities, as lead plaintiff, and appointing lead counsel in the consolidated action. On December 14, 2000, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Amended Complaint") in which they did not name as defendants Lazard Freres & Co. and Todd Slater, who had formerly been named as defendants in certain of the 20 complaints. A&F and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint on February 14, 2001. A&F is aware of three actions that have been filed where a purported class of employees and former employees of the Company allege that the Company required its associates to wear a "uniform" which in two of the three actions is allegedly in violation of California law. These two complaints were served on February 4, 2003 and February 10, 2003 in the Superior Courts of San Francisco County and Los Angeles County, respectively. In the third action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on March 14, 2003, the "uniform," which when purchased, allegedly drove associates wages below the federal minimum wage. In each claim, the plaintiff, on behalf of his or her class, seeks injunctive relief and economic, liquidated damages in an unspecified amount. A&F believes that the actions against it are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against them. However, A&F does not believe it is feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings. The timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is also uncertain. In addition, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") initiated a formal investigation regarding trading in the securities of A&F and the disclosure of sales forecasts in October 1999, and the Ohio Division of Securities requested information from A&F regarding these same matters. A&F was notified on April 3, 2003 that the SEC investigation has been terminated and no enforcement action has been recommended. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year were $534.5 million, an increase of 15% from $466.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $149.6 million compared to $128.6 million in 2001. A&F recorded its 42nd consecutive comparable quarter of record earnings as net income increased to $92.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to $79.2 million in 2001. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $.93, up 19% from $.78 in 2001. Net sales for the 2002 fiscal year reached $1.6 billion, an increase of 17% over fiscal 2001 net sales of $1.4 billion. Operating income for the 2002 fiscal year increased 15% to $312.6 million from $271.5 million in fiscal 2001. Net income per diluted share was $1.94 for the 2002 fiscal year compared to $1.65 in 2001, an increase of 18%. The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last 3 fiscal years expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2002 2001 2000 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 58.9 59.1 58.8 GROSS INCOME 41.1 40.9 41.2 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 21.5 21.0 20.7 OPERATING INCOME 19.6 19.9 20.5 Interest Income, Net (0.2) (0.4) (0.6) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.8 20.3 21.1 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.9 8.3 NET INCOME 12.2 12.4 12.8 11 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2002 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2001 and 2000: % Change 2002 2001 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 Net sales (millions) $1,595.8 $1,364.9 $1,237.6 17% 10% Decrease in comparable store sales (5%) (9%) (7%) Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 22% 19% 27% Retail sales per average gross square foot $379 $401 $474 (5%) (15%) Retail sales per average store (thousands) $2,797 $3,095 $3,944 (10%) (22%) Average store size at year end (gross square feet) 7,300 7,480 8,047 (2%) (7%) Gross square feet at year end (thousands) 4,358 3,673 2,849 19% 29% Number of stores and gross square feet by concept: Abercrombie & Fitch: Stores at beginning of period 309 265 215 Opened 33 45 50 Closed (2) (1) Stores at end of period 340 309 265 Gross square feet (thousands) 3,036 2,798 2,443 abercrombie: Stores at beginning of period 148 84 35 Opened 19 64 49 Closed (3) Stores at end of period 164 148 84 Gross square feet (thousands) 727 662 375 Hollister Co.: Stores at beginning of period 34 5 Opened 60 29 5 Closed (1) Stores at end of period 93 34 5 Gross square feet (thousands) 595 213 31 12 NET SALES Fourth Quarter 2002 Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $534.5 million, up 15% over 2001s fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales decreased 4% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps"), defined as sales in stores that have been open for at least one year, for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the mid single digits, with womens posting a positive comp and mens a negative comp. Comps for the kids business, abercrombie, were similar to the adult business with girls posting a positive comp increase during the quarter and boys a negative comp. Comps in Hollister were positive in double digits. By regions, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to strategically use direct mail and bounce back promotions, but, overall, a much less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken compared to 2001. The pre Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected, comp store sales were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December 2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of winter clearance, and positive results from the initial spring assortment. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops, outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there remained no solid trend industry wide. However, knit tops and woven shirts performed well during the quarter. As for the kids business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in the adult business, boys continued to be difficult. In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed best. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001. The Company remains on track to add a Hollister e commerce business for back to school 2003. The direct business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to 4.5% in 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 Fourth quarter 2001 net sales increased 6% to $466.6 million from $439.4 million in 2000. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9% decline in comps as compared with the previous years 13 week period ended February 3, 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 was highly promotional and a number of 13 promotional strategies, including direct mail, bouncebacks and selective price point reductions, were employed to improve the sales trend from the third quarter 2001. By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the high single digits with womens comps roughly flat for the quarter while mens comps were negative double digits. Comps for our kids business followed a similar trend to the adult business with girls comps much stronger than boys comps. By regions, comps were strongest in the Northeast and the West Coast and weakest in the Southeast and Midwest. From a merchandising standpoint, womens outperformed mens and generated strong comp increases in denim, graphic tees and skirts. Newer womens classifications, such as gymwear and lingerie performed well. Mens was difficult with no solid industry wide trend. Similar to womens, mens denim consistently performed well and comps were strong through Christmas. However, mens outerwear and sweater classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, strong girls categories were denim, skirts, knits and accessories while sweaters and outerwear classifications were weak. Boys strong classifications were knits and denim. In the adult e commerce business, sales grew by over 27% during the fourth quarter of 2001 compared to 2000. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites accounted for 4.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to 5.0% in 2000. The decrease is primarily due to the Company not producing an A&F Quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Fiscal 2002 Net sales for fiscal year 2002 reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over fiscal year 2001. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was primarily due to the weak performance in both the mens and boys. Mens comps decreased in low double digits for fiscal year 2002 while boys comps decreased in the mid teens. For Spring 2003, the Company continues to maintain a cautious approach in mens, focusing on delivering more new items more frequently. The mens assortment for spring features a "vintage look" which is emphasized in washes, colors and marketing. As in mens, a cautious approach will be maintained in boys. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for greater than 57% of the adult and kids businesses, respectively, in fiscal year 2002. For the year, womens comps were negative low single digits while girls comps were positive mid single digits. The Company will continue to focus on providing more frequent newness in both womens and girls in 2003. Items will flow into the stores faster and remain in stores for a shorter time period. This strategy gives the customer more new items without an increase in inventory investment. Hollister continued to perform well. For fiscal year 2002, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.7% of 2002 net sales compared to 4.2% in 2001. 14 Fiscal 2001 Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in 2000. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 137 stores offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was largely due to continued weakness in mens. Mens comps decreased in the high teens for the year; however, denim, knits and gymwear performed well. Comps were up in the mid single digits in womens for the 2001 fiscal year. The strongest performing categories were denim, knits, skirts, gymwear and womens accessories. Overall, womens increased as a percentage of the overall business. In fiscal 2001, womens accounted for 55% of the total adult business. In 2001, the kids business had a mid teen decline in comparable store sales for the year with girls performing better than boys. As in the adult business, girls outperformed boys. For the 2001 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 75% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.2% of fiscal 2001 net sales compared to 3.8% of 2000 net sales. Operating improvements in e commerce fulfillment helped reduce the number of backorders, increasing sales by improving in stocks. The Company produced only three A&F Quarterlys in fiscal 2001 versus four in 2000, dampening the increase over the prior year in the direct business. GROSS INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from last years rate of 44.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup (IMU), partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales. Continued progress in sourcing has been an important factor in improving the IMU in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing the IMU in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, the Companys less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges with a comp store decrease. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2002 with inventories up 12% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of 2001 at cost. 15 Fourth Quarter 2001 The gross income rate during the fourth quarter of 2001 was 44.7%, down from 46.2% for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate, attributable to the expected higher level of promotional business. The planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling at lower average retail prices. For the quarter, average unit retail prices decreased in the low double digits. Additionally, buying and occupancy costs, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. These decreases were partially offset by higher IMU and tight control of inventory. The increase in IMU was a result of continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise, particularly in womens. The tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down 30% per gross square foot at year end 2001 as compared with year end 2000. These low levels of inventory provided downside profit protection as season end merchandise was significantly lower on a per square foot basis in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000. Fiscal 2002 For fiscal 2002, the gross income rate was 41.1% versus 40.9% in 2001. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales. Tight control of inventory also protected gross income as the Company chased inventory through most of the first half of 2002. Fiscal 2001 For the 2001 fiscal year, the gross income rate decreased to 40.9% from 41.2% in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy costs. Buying and occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of net sales, due to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales. The decrease was almost entirely offset by higher IMU as a result of continued improvements in sourcing merchandise that reduced costs. The other factors in protecting gross income were tight control of inventory, which resulted in disciplined markdown control, and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the Companys continued emphasis on in store operational controls. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES Fourth Quarter 2002 The fourth quarter 2002 general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 17.5% compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in rate versus 2001 resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2002, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. Store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store expense rate. 16 Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher than the fourth quarter of 2001. For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in 2001 with 20% fewer labor hours. In the fourth quarter of 2002, fulfillment costs per order in the direct business were down by over 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 The fourth quarter 2001 general, administrative and store operating expense rate improved to 17.1% as compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Company continued to tightly control expenses in both the stores and the home office. These cost controls included limiting headcount additions, reducing home office travel and store payroll hours, and decreasing relocation and recruiting expenses. Savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter 2001, productivity in the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was over 50% higher than fourth quarter 2000. In the direct business, fulfillment costs per order were down by over 10%. These savings in general, administrative and store operating expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth quarter 2000s general, administrative and store operating expenses were unfavorably affected by one time expenses related to the move to the new distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2000. Fiscal 2002 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2002 was 21.5% versus 21.0% in 2001. The 2002 rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses. Fiscal 2001 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2001 was 21.0% versus 20.7% in 2000. The rate increase in 2001 was primarily due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in sales volume per average store. The increase was partially offset by the Companys focus on discretionary expense controls. OPERATING INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 28.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 compared to 27.6% for the same period in 2001. Less aggressive promotional activities and higher average selling prices increased the gross income rate in the current years fourth quarter. This improvement was offset somewhat by a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate. 17 Fiscal 2002 The operating income rate for the fiscal year 2002 was 19.6% versus 19.9% in fiscal year 2001. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Fourth Quarter 2001 and Fiscal 2001 The operating income rate was 27.6% and 19.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2001, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 20.5% for the same periods in 2000. The decline in operating income rate in these periods was primarily due to lower gross income percentages resulting from planned promotional strategies executed in the fourth quarter of 2001. Lower general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, partially offset the lower gross income rate in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the year, higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, added to the decrease in operating income rate. INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income were $1.3 and $3.8 million in 2002 as compared with net interest income of $1.2 and $5.1 million for the comparable periods in 2001. The decrease in net interest income in the year to date period was a result of the Companys strategy at the beginning of 2002 to invest cash in tax free securities due to the decline in short term market interest rates. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the commercial paper market. The tax free investments contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 38.5% and 38.4% for the fourth quarter and year to date periods of 2002 as compared to 39.0% for both of 2001s comparable periods. Net interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $5.1 million for the 2001 fiscal year compared with net interest income of $2.5 million and $7.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2000. The decrease in net interest income for both the quarter and the year was due to the decline in market interest rates. Net interest income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily from short term investments. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Companys continuing growth in net income affords it financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. 18 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. A summary of the Companys working capital position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Working capital $389,686 $241,616 $146,939 Capitalization Shareholders equity $749,527 $595,434 $422,700 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2002 2001 2000 Current ratio (current assets divided by current 2.84 2.48 1.94 liabilities) Operating cash flow (in thousands) $293,146 $233,202 $151,189 Net cash provided by operating activities is the Companys primary source of liquidity and has grown steadily the past three years from $151.2 million in 2000 to $233.2 million in 2001 to $293.1 million in 2002. Current year net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization was the primary source of cash. Additionally, in 2002, cash was provided from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in 2002 due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments versus 2001. Accrued expenses increased in 2002 due to the following: higher incentive compensation expenses, resulting from the Companys improved financial performance; higher store expenses and gift card liability, consistent with the increase in store openings; and higher legal expenses. The increase in income taxes payable in the current year was due primarily to a change in the methodology being used to make estimated tax payments throughout 2002. This methodology was modified to more closely reflect interim liabilities under the annualization method. In addition, the favorable impact of the Companys stock based compensation was significantly reduced reflecting the lower stock prices during 2002 as compared to 2001. Net deferred income taxes increased in 2002 primarily as a result of increasing differences between book and tax depreciation methods due to the accelerated growth of store openings the past few years and "bonus" accelerated depreciation allowed under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Inventories increased $35.3 million during 2002 and represented the primary use of cash. Inventories at fiscal 2002 year end were 12% higher on a gross square foot basis versus fiscal 2001 year end. 19 Other uses of cash were directly related to store growth and primarily consisted of increases in capitalized store supplies and prepaid rent related to stores (classified in other current assets). The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows related to investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Investing activities also included purchases and maturities of marketable securities. As of February 1, 2003, the Company held marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. The decrease in note receivable resulted from the repayment of a promissory note by the Chairman (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Financing activities during 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of the repurchase of 1,850,000 shares, 600,000 shares, and 3,550,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The 2002 repurchase completed a previously authorized 6,000,000 share repurchase program. At its August 2002 Board meeting, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5,000,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock. As of February 1, 2003, the total number of shares authorized and available for repurchase was 5,000,000. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. During the first nine months of 2002, the Company had available a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement. The Company also had a $75 million facility for trade letters of credit. The trade letters of credit were issued to numerous overseas suppliers and served as guarantees to the suppliers. Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), which replaced both the then existing credit agreement (the "Old Credit Agreement") and the trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the New Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $41.8 million were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003. Letters of credit totaling approximately $49.9 million were outstanding under the trade letter of credit facility at February 2, 2002. No borrowings were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003 or under the Old Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that expire in one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. 20 As of February 1, 2003, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms of one to fourteen years. These commitments include store leases with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen years. A summary of minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases follows (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years $889,328 $120,313 $352,910 $186,434 $229,671 STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by concept were as follows: February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 Number of Gross Square Number of Gross Square Stores Feet (millions) Stores Feet (millions) Abercrombie & Fitch 340 3,036 309 2,798 abercrombie 164 727 148 662 Hollister Co. 93 595 34 213 Total 597 4,358 491 3,673 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $93.0 million, $126.5 million and $153.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the noncash accrual for construction in progress decreased $12.7 million in 2002 and increased $1.0 million and $9.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2002 related to new store construction with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 related to the construction of a new office and distribution center, including the noncash accrual for construction in progress, accounted for approximately $17 million and $92 million of total capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The office and distribution center were completed in 2001. The balance of capital expenditures related primarily to new stores. The Company anticipates spending $120 to $130 million in 2003 for capital expenditures, of which $70 to $80 million will be for new stores construction. The balance of expenditures primarily relates to improving the in store information technology structure, which should be complete for back to school, and distribution center expansion. In addition, the Company has begun construction planning for additional home office space to accommodate the growth of Hollister. The Company intends to add approximately 726,000 gross square feet for the three concepts in 2003, which will represent a 17% increase over year end 2002. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 30 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 70 new Hollister Co. stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in 2003 will approximate $630,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $330,000 per store. 21 The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened in 2003 will approximate $485,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $130,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister Co. stores opened in 2003 will approximate $650,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $230,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its credit agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At A&F, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory valuation as it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. 22 Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 10 15 years for leasehold improvements and 3 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The standard was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. The standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. 23 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34," that requires recognition of a liability (at fair value) for guarantee contracts that have any of the following characteristics: Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on changes in an underlying, as defined by SFAS No. 133; Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligating agreement; Indemnification agreements; Indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. In addition to the disclosures required by current GAAP related to guarantees, this interpretation requires additional disclosures including: Details about the nature of the guarantee; The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted); The current carrying amount of the liability for guarantors obligation under the guarantee; The nature of any recourse provisions. Guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 must follow the new accounting. The disclosure requirements were effective for the 2002 financial statements and did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. The recognition provisions will be adopted by the Company in 2003 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard rescinds FASB Statements No. 4 and 64 that deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of debt. The standard also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44 that deals with intangible assets of motor carriers. The standard modifies FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," so that certain capital lease modifications must be accounted for by lessees as sale leaseback transactions. Additionally, the standard identifies amendments that should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally amends the appropriate pronouncements. The provisions of this standard related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are in effect in 2003. The remaining provisions of the statement were adopted by the Company for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred. The provisions of the standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment to FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that choose to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," will be permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified prospective, and retroactive restatement). 24 Companies that choose not to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 will be affected by the new disclosure requirements of FASB No. 148. The new disclosures include tabular presentation of the following information for all periods presented: 1. Net income and EPS (basic and diluted), as reported; 2. Compensation expense (if any), net of tax, included in reported net income; 3. Compensation expense that would have been included in net income had the company adopted the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 for all awards granted, modified or settled since December 15, 1994; 4. Pro forma net income and earnings per share. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FASB No. 148 are effective for the 2002 financial statements. The new interim disclosure provisions are effective in the first quarter of 2003. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor," addresses the accounting treatment for cash vendor allowances received. The adoption of EITF Issue 02 16 in 2003 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Companys financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward looking statements included in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates. 25 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash and equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 1, 2003, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 26 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year were $534.5 million, an increase of 15% from $466.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $149.6 million compared to $128.6 million in 2001. A&F recorded its 42nd consecutive comparable quarter of record earnings as net income increased to $92.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to $79.2 million in 2001. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $.93, up 19% from $.78 in 2001. Net sales for the 2002 fiscal year reached $1.6 billion, an increase of 17% over fiscal 2001 net sales of $1.4 billion. Operating income for the 2002 fiscal year increased 15% to $312.6 million from $271.5 million in fiscal 2001. Net income per diluted share was $1.94 for the 2002 fiscal year compared to $1.65 in 2001, an increase of 18%. The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last 3 fiscal years expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2002 2001 2000 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 58.9 59.1 58.8 GROSS INCOME 41.1 40.9 41.2 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 21.5 21.0 20.7 OPERATING INCOME 19.6 19.9 20.5 Interest Income, Net (0.2) (0.4) (0.6) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.8 20.3 21.1 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.9 8.3 NET INCOME 12.2 12.4 12.8 11 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2002 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2001 and 2000: % Change 2002 2001 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 Net sales (millions) $1,595.8 $1,364.9 $1,237.6 17% 10% Decrease in comparable store sales (5%) (9%) (7%) Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 22% 19% 27% Retail sales per average gross square foot $379 $401 $474 (5%) (15%) Retail sales per average store (thousands) $2,797 $3,095 $3,944 (10%) (22%) Average store size at year end (gross square feet) 7,300 7,480 8,047 (2%) (7%) Gross square feet at year end (thousands) 4,358 3,673 2,849 19% 29% Number of stores and gross square feet by concept: Abercrombie & Fitch: Stores at beginning of period 309 265 215 Opened 33 45 50 Closed (2) (1) Stores at end of period 340 309 265 Gross square feet (thousands) 3,036 2,798 2,443 abercrombie: Stores at beginning of period 148 84 35 Opened 19 64 49 Closed (3) Stores at end of period 164 148 84 Gross square feet (thousands) 727 662 375 Hollister Co.: Stores at beginning of period 34 5 Opened 60 29 5 Closed (1) Stores at end of period 93 34 5 Gross square feet (thousands) 595 213 31 12 NET SALES Fourth Quarter 2002 Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $534.5 million, up 15% over 2001s fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales decreased 4% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps"), defined as sales in stores that have been open for at least one year, for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the mid single digits, with womens posting a positive comp and mens a negative comp. Comps for the kids business, abercrombie, were similar to the adult business with girls posting a positive comp increase during the quarter and boys a negative comp. Comps in Hollister were positive in double digits. By regions, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to strategically use direct mail and bounce back promotions, but, overall, a much less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken compared to 2001. The pre Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected, comp store sales were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December 2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of winter clearance, and positive results from the initial spring assortment. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops, outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there remained no solid trend industry wide. However, knit tops and woven shirts performed well during the quarter. As for the kids business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in the adult business, boys continued to be difficult. In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed best. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001. The Company remains on track to add a Hollister e commerce business for back to school 2003. The direct business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to 4.5% in 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 Fourth quarter 2001 net sales increased 6% to $466.6 million from $439.4 million in 2000. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9% decline in comps as compared with the previous years 13 week period ended February 3, 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 was highly promotional and a number of 13 promotional strategies, including direct mail, bouncebacks and selective price point reductions, were employed to improve the sales trend from the third quarter 2001. By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined in the high single digits with womens comps roughly flat for the quarter while mens comps were negative double digits. Comps for our kids business followed a similar trend to the adult business with girls comps much stronger than boys comps. By regions, comps were strongest in the Northeast and the West Coast and weakest in the Southeast and Midwest. From a merchandising standpoint, womens outperformed mens and generated strong comp increases in denim, graphic tees and skirts. Newer womens classifications, such as gymwear and lingerie performed well. Mens was difficult with no solid industry wide trend. Similar to womens, mens denim consistently performed well and comps were strong through Christmas. However, mens outerwear and sweater classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, strong girls categories were denim, skirts, knits and accessories while sweaters and outerwear classifications were weak. Boys strong classifications were knits and denim. In the adult e commerce business, sales grew by over 27% during the fourth quarter of 2001 compared to 2000. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites accounted for 4.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to 5.0% in 2000. The decrease is primarily due to the Company not producing an A&F Quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Fiscal 2002 Net sales for fiscal year 2002 reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over fiscal year 2001. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was primarily due to the weak performance in both the mens and boys. Mens comps decreased in low double digits for fiscal year 2002 while boys comps decreased in the mid teens. For Spring 2003, the Company continues to maintain a cautious approach in mens, focusing on delivering more new items more frequently. The mens assortment for spring features a "vintage look" which is emphasized in washes, colors and marketing. As in mens, a cautious approach will be maintained in boys. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for greater than 57% of the adult and kids businesses, respectively, in fiscal year 2002. For the year, womens comps were negative low single digits while girls comps were positive mid single digits. The Company will continue to focus on providing more frequent newness in both womens and girls in 2003. Items will flow into the stores faster and remain in stores for a shorter time period. This strategy gives the customer more new items without an increase in inventory investment. Hollister continued to perform well. For fiscal year 2002, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.7% of 2002 net sales compared to 4.2% in 2001. 14 Fiscal 2001 Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24 billion in 2000. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 137 stores offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was largely due to continued weakness in mens. Mens comps decreased in the high teens for the year; however, denim, knits and gymwear performed well. Comps were up in the mid single digits in womens for the 2001 fiscal year. The strongest performing categories were denim, knits, skirts, gymwear and womens accessories. Overall, womens increased as a percentage of the overall business. In fiscal 2001, womens accounted for 55% of the total adult business. In 2001, the kids business had a mid teen decline in comparable store sales for the year with girls performing better than boys. As in the adult business, girls outperformed boys. For the 2001 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 75% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.2% of fiscal 2001 net sales compared to 3.8% of 2000 net sales. Operating improvements in e commerce fulfillment helped reduce the number of backorders, increasing sales by improving in stocks. The Company produced only three A&F Quarterlys in fiscal 2001 versus four in 2000, dampening the increase over the prior year in the direct business. GROSS INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from last years rate of 44.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup (IMU), partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales. Continued progress in sourcing has been an important factor in improving the IMU in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing the IMU in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2001. Additionally, the Companys less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges with a comp store decrease. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2002 with inventories up 12% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of 2001 at cost. 15 Fourth Quarter 2001 The gross income rate during the fourth quarter of 2001 was 44.7%, down from 46.2% for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate, attributable to the expected higher level of promotional business. The planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling at lower average retail prices. For the quarter, average unit retail prices decreased in the low double digits. Additionally, buying and occupancy costs, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. These decreases were partially offset by higher IMU and tight control of inventory. The increase in IMU was a result of continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise, particularly in womens. The tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down 30% per gross square foot at year end 2001 as compared with year end 2000. These low levels of inventory provided downside profit protection as season end merchandise was significantly lower on a per square foot basis in the fourth quarter of 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000. Fiscal 2002 For fiscal 2002, the gross income rate was 41.1% versus 40.9% in 2001. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales. Tight control of inventory also protected gross income as the Company chased inventory through most of the first half of 2002. Fiscal 2001 For the 2001 fiscal year, the gross income rate decreased to 40.9% from 41.2% in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy costs. Buying and occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of net sales, due to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales. The decrease was almost entirely offset by higher IMU as a result of continued improvements in sourcing merchandise that reduced costs. The other factors in protecting gross income were tight control of inventory, which resulted in disciplined markdown control, and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the Companys continued emphasis on in store operational controls. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES Fourth Quarter 2002 The fourth quarter 2002 general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 17.5% compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in rate versus 2001 resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance. During the fourth quarter of 2002, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. Store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store expense rate. 16 Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher than the fourth quarter of 2001. For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in 2001 with 20% fewer labor hours. In the fourth quarter of 2002, fulfillment costs per order in the direct business were down by over 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth Quarter 2001 The fourth quarter 2001 general, administrative and store operating expense rate improved to 17.1% as compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Company continued to tightly control expenses in both the stores and the home office. These cost controls included limiting headcount additions, reducing home office travel and store payroll hours, and decreasing relocation and recruiting expenses. Savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the direct business. During the fourth quarter 2001, productivity in the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was over 50% higher than fourth quarter 2000. In the direct business, fulfillment costs per order were down by over 10%. These savings in general, administrative and store operating expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2001. Fourth quarter 2000s general, administrative and store operating expenses were unfavorably affected by one time expenses related to the move to the new distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2000. Fiscal 2002 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2002 was 21.5% versus 21.0% in 2001. The 2002 rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses. Fiscal 2001 The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2001 was 21.0% versus 20.7% in 2000. The rate increase in 2001 was primarily due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in sales volume per average store. The increase was partially offset by the Companys focus on discretionary expense controls. OPERATING INCOME Fourth Quarter 2002 The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 28.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 compared to 27.6% for the same period in 2001. Less aggressive promotional activities and higher average selling prices increased the gross income rate in the current years fourth quarter. This improvement was offset somewhat by a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate. 17 Fiscal 2002 The operating income rate for the fiscal year 2002 was 19.6% versus 19.9% in fiscal year 2001. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Fourth Quarter 2001 and Fiscal 2001 The operating income rate was 27.6% and 19.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2001, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 20.5% for the same periods in 2000. The decline in operating income rate in these periods was primarily due to lower gross income percentages resulting from planned promotional strategies executed in the fourth quarter of 2001. Lower general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, partially offset the lower gross income rate in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the year, higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, added to the decrease in operating income rate. INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income were $1.3 and $3.8 million in 2002 as compared with net interest income of $1.2 and $5.1 million for the comparable periods in 2001. The decrease in net interest income in the year to date period was a result of the Companys strategy at the beginning of 2002 to invest cash in tax free securities due to the decline in short term market interest rates. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the commercial paper market. The tax free investments contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 38.5% and 38.4% for the fourth quarter and year to date periods of 2002 as compared to 39.0% for both of 2001s comparable periods. Net interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $5.1 million for the 2001 fiscal year compared with net interest income of $2.5 million and $7.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2000. The decrease in net interest income for both the quarter and the year was due to the decline in market interest rates. Net interest income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily from short term investments. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Companys continuing growth in net income affords it financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. 18 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. A summary of the Companys working capital position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Working capital $389,686 $241,616 $146,939 Capitalization Shareholders equity $749,527 $595,434 $422,700 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2002 2001 2000 Current ratio (current assets divided by current 2.84 2.48 1.94 liabilities) Operating cash flow (in thousands) $293,146 $233,202 $151,189 Net cash provided by operating activities is the Companys primary source of liquidity and has grown steadily the past three years from $151.2 million in 2000 to $233.2 million in 2001 to $293.1 million in 2002. Current year net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization was the primary source of cash. Additionally, in 2002, cash was provided from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in 2002 due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments versus 2001. Accrued expenses increased in 2002 due to the following: higher incentive compensation expenses, resulting from the Companys improved financial performance; higher store expenses and gift card liability, consistent with the increase in store openings; and higher legal expenses. The increase in income taxes payable in the current year was due primarily to a change in the methodology being used to make estimated tax payments throughout 2002. This methodology was modified to more closely reflect interim liabilities under the annualization method. In addition, the favorable impact of the Companys stock based compensation was significantly reduced reflecting the lower stock prices during 2002 as compared to 2001. Net deferred income taxes increased in 2002 primarily as a result of increasing differences between book and tax depreciation methods due to the accelerated growth of store openings the past few years and "bonus" accelerated depreciation allowed under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. Inventories increased $35.3 million during 2002 and represented the primary use of cash. Inventories at fiscal 2002 year end were 12% higher on a gross square foot basis versus fiscal 2001 year end. 19 Other uses of cash were directly related to store growth and primarily consisted of increases in capitalized store supplies and prepaid rent related to stores (classified in other current assets). The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows related to investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Investing activities also included purchases and maturities of marketable securities. As of February 1, 2003, the Company held marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. The decrease in note receivable resulted from the repayment of a promissory note by the Chairman (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Financing activities during 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of the repurchase of 1,850,000 shares, 600,000 shares, and 3,550,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The 2002 repurchase completed a previously authorized 6,000,000 share repurchase program. At its August 2002 Board meeting, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5,000,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock. As of February 1, 2003, the total number of shares authorized and available for repurchase was 5,000,000. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. During the first nine months of 2002, the Company had available a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement. The Company also had a $75 million facility for trade letters of credit. The trade letters of credit were issued to numerous overseas suppliers and served as guarantees to the suppliers. Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), which replaced both the then existing credit agreement (the "Old Credit Agreement") and the trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the New Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $41.8 million were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003. Letters of credit totaling approximately $49.9 million were outstanding under the trade letter of credit facility at February 2, 2002. No borrowings were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003 or under the Old Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002. The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that expire in one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. 20 As of February 1, 2003, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms of one to fourteen years. These commitments include store leases with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen years. A summary of minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases follows (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years $889,328 $120,313 $352,910 $186,434 $229,671 STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by concept were as follows: February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 Number of Gross Square Number of Gross Square Stores Feet (millions) Stores Feet (millions) Abercrombie & Fitch 340 3,036 309 2,798 abercrombie 164 727 148 662 Hollister Co. 93 595 34 213 Total 597 4,358 491 3,673 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $93.0 million, $126.5 million and $153.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the noncash accrual for construction in progress decreased $12.7 million in 2002 and increased $1.0 million and $9.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2002 related to new store construction with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 related to the construction of a new office and distribution center, including the noncash accrual for construction in progress, accounted for approximately $17 million and $92 million of total capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The office and distribution center were completed in 2001. The balance of capital expenditures related primarily to new stores. The Company anticipates spending $120 to $130 million in 2003 for capital expenditures, of which $70 to $80 million will be for new stores construction. The balance of expenditures primarily relates to improving the in store information technology structure, which should be complete for back to school, and distribution center expansion. In addition, the Company has begun construction planning for additional home office space to accommodate the growth of Hollister. The Company intends to add approximately 726,000 gross square feet for the three concepts in 2003, which will represent a 17% increase over year end 2002. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 30 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 70 new Hollister Co. stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in 2003 will approximate $630,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $330,000 per store. 21 The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened in 2003 will approximate $485,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $130,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister Co. stores opened in 2003 will approximate $650,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $230,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its credit agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At A&F, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory valuation as it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. 22 Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 10 15 years for leasehold improvements and 3 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The standard was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. The standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. 23 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34," that requires recognition of a liability (at fair value) for guarantee contracts that have any of the following characteristics: Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on changes in an underlying, as defined by SFAS No. 133; Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligating agreement; Indemnification agreements; Indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. In addition to the disclosures required by current GAAP related to guarantees, this interpretation requires additional disclosures including: Details about the nature of the guarantee; The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted); The current carrying amount of the liability for guarantors obligation under the guarantee; The nature of any recourse provisions. Guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 must follow the new accounting. The disclosure requirements were effective for the 2002 financial statements and did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position in 2002. The recognition provisions will be adopted by the Company in 2003 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard rescinds FASB Statements No. 4 and 64 that deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of debt. The standard also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44 that deals with intangible assets of motor carriers. The standard modifies FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," so that certain capital lease modifications must be accounted for by lessees as sale leaseback transactions. Additionally, the standard identifies amendments that should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally amends the appropriate pronouncements. The provisions of this standard related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are in effect in 2003. The remaining provisions of the statement were adopted by the Company for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred. The provisions of the standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment to FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that choose to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," will be permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified prospective, and retroactive restatement). 24 Companies that choose not to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 will be affected by the new disclosure requirements of FASB No. 148. The new disclosures include tabular presentation of the following information for all periods presented: 1. Net income and EPS (basic and diluted), as reported; 2. Compensation expense (if any), net of tax, included in reported net income; 3. Compensation expense that would have been included in net income had the company adopted the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 for all awards granted, modified or settled since December 15, 1994; 4. Pro forma net income and earnings per share. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FASB No. 148 are effective for the 2002 financial statements. The new interim disclosure provisions are effective in the first quarter of 2003. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor," addresses the accounting treatment for cash vendor allowances received. The adoption of EITF Issue 02 16 in 2003 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Companys financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward looking statements included in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates. 25 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash and equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities of three to five months. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 1, 2003, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 26
