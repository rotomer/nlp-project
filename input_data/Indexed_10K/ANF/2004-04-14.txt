ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. COMPETITION. The sale of apparel and personal care products through retail stores and e commerce is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores and department stores. Fashion, price, service, store location, selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales and on line sales. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e commerce. ASSOCIATE RELATIONS. On March 26, 2004, the Company employed approximately 30,200 associates (none of whom were party to a collective bargaining agreement), approximately 26,400 of whom were part time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the Holiday season. The Company believes its relationship with associates is good. However, in the normal course of business, the Company is party to lawsuits involving a small number of its former and current associates. RISK FACTORS. The following risk factors should be read in connection with evaluating the Companys business and the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. The Loss of the Services of Key Personnel Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Business. The Companys executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in the retail business and have made significant contributions to the growth and success of the Companys brands. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect the Company. Business Could Suffer As a Result of a Manufacturers Inability to Produce Merchandise on Time and to Specifications. The Company does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depends upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all its merchandise. The Company uses both domestic and international manufacturers to produce its merchandise. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or meet the Companys quality standards could cause delivery date requirements to be missed, which could result in lost sales. 5 Business Could Suffer if a Manufacturer Fails to Use Acceptable Labor Practices. The Companys sourcing agents and independent manufacturers are required to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. While the Companys vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and Company representatives periodically visit and monitor the operations of the independent manufacturers, the Company does not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer, or by one of the sourcing agents, or the divergence of an independent manufacturers or sourcing agents labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products or damage the Companys reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Companys Business is Subject to Risks Associated with Importing Products. The Company sources the majority of its merchandise from outside the United States through arrangements with approximately 210 foreign manufacturers located throughout the world. Risks inherent in importing merchandise include: quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements; changes in social, political and economic conditions which could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which manufacturers or suppliers are located; the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports; the imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys Success Depends on its Ability to Respond to Constantly Changing Fashion Trends and Consumer Demands. The Companys success depends on its ability to create and define fashion products, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. The merchandise must appeal to each brands corresponding target market of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future. Any failure to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of the merchandise resulting in missed opportunities. If that occurs, the Company may need to rely on markdowns to sell through the excess, slow moving inventory, which may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. At the same time, managements focus on tight inventory control may result, from time to time, in lost sales due to an inadequate supply of products to meet consumer demand. A Downturn in the United States Economy May Affect Consumer Spending Habits. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including the Companys products, may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower. A downturn in the economy may adversely affect the Companys sales. The current economic conditions have and may continue to adversely affect consumer spending and sales of the Companys products. 6 The Company Relies on a Single Distribution Center. The Company operates one distribution center to receive, store and distribute merchandise to all of its stores and fulfill e commerce sales. Any significant interruption in the operation of the distribution center due to natural disasters, accidents, system failures or other unforeseen causes could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results. The Outcome of Litigation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Business. The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation incidental to its business. Management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. However, managements assessment of the Companys current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with managements evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation. Any one of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. 7 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Companys headquarters and support functions (consisting of office, distribution and shipping facilities) are located in New Albany, Ohio and owned by the Company. All of the retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United States. The leases expire at various dates, principally between 2004 and 2016. Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the size and location of the store. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by the tenant. As of January 31, 2004, the Companys 700 stores were located in 49 states and the District of Columbia as follows: Alabama 13 Kentucky 10 North Dakota 1 Alaska 1 Louisiana 14 Ohio 33 Arizona 13 Maine 3 Oklahoma 10 Arkansas 4 Maryland 6 Oregon 5 California 69 Massachusetts 17 Pennsylvania 34 Colorado 11 Michigan 29 Rhode Island 3 Connecticut 14 Minnesota 17 South Carolina 6 Delaware 1 Mississippi 5 South Dakota 2 District of Columbia 1 Missouri 22 Tennessee 17 Florida 35 Montana 2 Texas 51 Georgia 25 Nebraska 4 Utah 5 Hawaii 1 Nevada 5 Vermont 2 Idaho 1 New Hampshire 5 Virginia 19 Illinois 37 New Jersey 21 Washington 17 Indiana 20 New Mexico 3 West Virginia 3 Iowa 3 New York 36 Wisconsin 15 Kansas 7 North Carolina 22 8 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. A&F is aware of 20 actions that have been filed against A&F and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of a purported, but as yet uncertified, class of shareholders who purchased A&Fs Class A Common Stock between October 8, 1999 and October 13, 1999. These 20 actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, alleging violations of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages. On April 12, 2000, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued a Transfer Order transferring the 20 pending actions to the Southern District of New York for consolidated pretrial proceedings under the caption In re Abercrombie & Fitch Securities Litigation. On November 16, 2000, the Court signed an Order appointing the Hicks Group, a group of seven unrelated investors in A&Fs securities, as lead plaintiff, and appointing lead counsel in the consolidated action. On December 14, 2000, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Amended Complaint") in which they did not name as defendants Lazard Freres & Co. and Todd Slater, who had formerly been named as defendants in certain of the 20 complaints. A&F and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint on February 14, 2001. On November 14, 2003, the motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint were denied. On December 2, 2003, A&F moved for reconsideration or reargument of the November 14, 2003 order denying the motions to dismiss. The motions for reconsideration or reargument were fully briefed and submitted to the Court on January 9, 2004. The motions were denied on February 23, 2004. A&F is aware of six actions that have been filed on behalf of purported classes of employees and former employees of the Company alleging that the Company required its associates to wear and pay for a "uniform" in violation of applicable law. In each case, the plaintiff, on behalf of his or her purported class, seeks injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of economic and liquidated damages. Two of these cases, Jennifer M. Solis v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. and A&F California, LLC and Sarah Stevenson v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co., allege violations of California law and were filed on February 10, 2003 and February 4, 2003 in the California Superior Courts for Los Angeles County and San Francisco County, respectively. An answer was filed in the Solis case on March 26, 2003. Pursuant to a Petition for Coordination, the Solis and the Stevenson cases were coordinated by order issued November 17, 2003. Jadii Mohme v. Abercrombie & Fitch, which alleges violations of Illinois law, was filed on July 18, 2003 in the Illinois Circuit Court of St. Clair County. A first amended complaint was filed in the Mohme case on September 10, 2003 to change the defendant to "Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc." from "Abercrombie & Fitch." An answer to the first amended complaint was filed in the Mohme case on September 26, 2003. The parties are in the process of discovery. Shelby Port v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., which alleges violations of Washington law, was filed on or about July 18, 2003 in the Washington Superior Court of King County. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the Port case on September 5, 2003. That motion is pending. Holly Zemany v. Abercrombie & Fitch, which alleges violations of Pennsylvania law, was filed on July 18, 2003 in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. A first amended complaint was filed in the Zemany case on September 9, 2003 to change the defendant to "Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc." from "Abercrombie & Fitch." A second amended complaint was filed November 10, 2003, adding some factual allegations. Defendant filed an answer to the second amended complaint on January 22, 2004. 9 In Michael Gualano v. Abercrombie & Fitch, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on March 14, 2003, the plaintiff alleges that the "uniform," when purchased, drove associates wages below the federal minimum wage. The complaint purports to state a collective action on behalf of all part time associates nationwide under the Fair Labor Standards Act. A first amended complaint was filed in the Gualano case on September 9, 2003, to change the defendant to "Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc." from "Abercrombie & Fitch." An answer to the first amended complaint was filed in the Gualano case on or about September 24, 2003, and the parties are in the process of discovery. A&F is aware of two actions that have been filed on behalf of purported classes alleged to be discriminated against in hiring or employment decisions due to race and or national origin. Eduardo Gonzalez, et al. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. was filed on June 16, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to add A&F California, LLC, Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. and A&F Ohio, Inc. as defendants. The plaintiffs allege, on behalf of their purported class, that they were discriminated against in hiring and employment decisions due to their race and or national origin. The plaintiffs seek, on behalf of their purported class, injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of economic, compensatory and punitive damages. A second amended complaint, which added two additional plaintiffs, was filed on or about January 9, 2004. Defendant filed an answer to the second amended complaint on or about January 26, 2004. The parties are in the process of discovery. A&F is aware that Brandy Hawk v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. was filed on or about November 19, 2003 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff alleged, on behalf of her purported class, that she was discriminated against in hiring decisions due to her race. The Hawk matter was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on or about December 5, 2003. In addition, the EEOC is conducting nationwide investigations relating to allegations of discrimination based on race, national origin and gender. A&F is aware of two actions that have been filed against the Company involving overtime compensation. In each action, the plaintiffs, on behalf of their respective purported class, seek injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of economic and liquidated damages. In Bryan T. Kimbell, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated and on Behalf of the Public v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., which was filed on July 10, 2002 in the California Superior Court for Los Angeles County, the plaintiffs allege that California general and store managers were entitled to receive overtime pay as "non exempt" employees under California wage and hour laws. An answer was filed in the Kimbell case on September 4, 2002 and the parties are in the process of discovery. In Melissa Mitchell, et al. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., which was filed on June 13, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, the plaintiffs allege that assistant managers and store managers were not paid overtime compensation in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Ohio law. A&F filed a motion to dismiss the Mitchell case on July 28, 2003, which is pending. A&F believes that these actions are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against them. However, A&F does not believe it is feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings. The timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is also uncertain. ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $560.4 million, an increase of 5% from $534.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $154.3 million compared to $149.6 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Net income increased to $94.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to $92.8 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $.96, up 3% from $.93 in the 2002 fiscal year. Net sales for the 2003 fiscal year were $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over the 2002 fiscal year net sales of $1.6 billion. Operating income for the 2003 fiscal year increased 6% to $331.6 million from $312.6 million for the 2002 fiscal year. Net income per diluted share was $2.06 for the 2003 fiscal year compared to $1.94 in the 2002 fiscal year, an increase of 6%. During the 2003 fiscal year, the Company continued its growth strategy by opening 19 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 9 abercrombie stores and 79 Hollister stores, for a total of 107 stores. Sales productivity of these new store openings continues to be high. During the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year, the new stores in all three concepts opened during the past 12 months averaged approximately the same sales per square foot as the existing store base. The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2003 2002 2001 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 58.0 58.9 59.1 GROSS INCOME 42.0 41.1 40.9 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 22.6 21.5 21.0 OPERATING INCOME 19.4 19.6 19.9 Interest Income, Net (0.2) (0.2) (0.4) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.6 19.8 20.3 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.6 7.9 NET INCOME 12.0 12.2 12.4 15 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2003 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2002 and 2001: Change 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003 2001 2002 Net sales (millions) $ 1,708 $ 1,596 $ 1,365 7% 17% Decrease in comparable store sales (9)% (5)% (9)% Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 16% 22% 19% Retail sales per average gross $ 345 $ 379 $ 401 (9)% (5)% square foot Retail sales per average store $ 2,494 $ 2,797 $ 3,095 (11)% (10)% (thousands) Average store size at year end 7,173 7,300 7,480 (2)% (2)% (gross square feet) Gross square feet at year end 5,021 4,358 3,673 15% 19% (thousands) Number of stores and gross square feet by concept: Abercrombie & Fitch: Stores at beginning of period 340 309 265 Opened 19 33 45 Closed (2) (2) (1) Stores at end of period 357 340 309 Gross square feet (thousands) 3,154 3,036 2,798 abercrombie: Stores at beginning of period 164 148 84 Opened 9 19 64 Closed (2) (3) Stores at end of period 171 164 148 Gross square feet (thousands) 753 727 662 Hollister: Stores at beginning of period 93 34 5 Opened 79 60 29 Closed (1) Stores at end of period 172 93 34 Gross square feet (thousands) 1,114 595 213 16 NET SALES Fourth Quarter 2003 Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $560.4 million, up 5% over last years fourth quarter net sales of $534.5 million. Comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores that have been open for at least one year, decreased 11% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps") for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 14% with mens comps declining in the low twenties and womens declining by a high single digit percentage. In abercrombie, the kids business, comps decreased 7% with girls achieving a low single digit positive comp increase and boys comps declining in the low twenties. In Hollister, comps were flat when compared to last year for the quarter. Hollister girls comps were a positive low single digit for the fourth quarter, while guys comps were a negative mid single digit. On a regional basis, comp store results across all three concepts were strongest along the East Coast and in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Stores located in Florida, Southern California and the New York metropolitan area had the best comp performance. From a promotional standpoint, the Company used direct mail promotions during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year to drive business between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but did not anniversary the 2002 fourth quarter issuance of a bounce back coupon. Also, the Company did not repeat a 15% off bag stuffer coupon that impacted late December and January business in fiscal 2002. Overall, the Company sought to have a less promotional look to the stores in the 2003 fiscal year. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. In Abercrombie & Fitch, womens had strong comp store increases in the fourth quarter in knits, fleece and skirts. Weak classifications included woven shirts and outerwear. The mens business continued to be difficult. However, graphic t shirts and woven shirts were classifications that had comp increases while the sweater and outerwear classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, for the quarter, knits, sweats and pants had strong comp store increases in girls, which were somewhat offset by weak business in sweaters, shirts, outerwear and gymwear. Boys graphic tees, woven shirts and accessories had comp increases, but these increases were not sufficient to offset other weaker performing classifications. In Hollister, girls also achieved stronger comps than guys. In girls, sweats, skirts, pants and denim had significant comp store increases during the quarter, while comps in the sweater and outerwear classifications declined. In guys, woven shirts, denim and sweats had positive comp store increases. However, the sweater, knit tops and outerwear classifications had significant declines. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 42% during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year as compared to the same period during the 2002 fiscal year. The Company added a Hollister e commerce business during back to school 2003. The direct to consumer business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 6.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year as compared to 5.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. 17 Fiscal 2003 Net sales for the 2003 fiscal year reached $1.7 billion, up 7% over the 2002 fiscal year. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 103 stores partially offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. By merchandise concept, comps for the 2003 fiscal year were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 11% with mens comps declining low twenties and womens comps declining mid single digits. abercrombie comps declined 6% with girls achieving a mid single digit positive comp store increase and boys posting a negative comp in the high teens. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for approximately 63% of the adult and kids businesses in the 2003 fiscal year. Hollister comps for the 2003 fiscal year were a positive 7%, with girls comps positive in low double digits and guys slightly negative. During the year, Hollister continued to gain in productivity relative to Abercrombie & Fitch. For the 2003 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 113% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. For the 2003 fiscal year, e commerce sales grew by approximately 39% as compared to the 2002 fiscal year. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly, and the Companys Web sites represented 5.3% of net sales for the 2003 fiscal year compared to 4.7% in the 2002 fiscal year. Current Trends and Outlook The Company experienced double digit comp store increases each year from the 1996 fiscal year to the 1999 fiscal year, reaching sales per gross square foot of $505 in fiscal 1999, a level significantly higher than most of its competitors. The Company believes that the comp store decreases since then reflect both a difficult retail environment and a normalization of the Companys sales per square foot relative to its competition. The Company achieved positive comp store increases in January and February 2004 and while March 2004 comps were down slightly, the Company is encouraged by this improvement in trend. Although the Company is confident that comps will improve in the future, due to the uncertain competitive and economic environment, it cannot predict whether this will occur in the 2004 fiscal year or any subsequent year. Driving top line revenue will be the Companys priority in the 2004 fiscal year and the Company has made a number of organizational changes intended to strengthen the design and merchandising groups. Additionally, changes have been made in the Companys marketing strategies. The A&F Quarterly has been discontinued and the Company plans to use a variety of marketing vehicles (including lifestyle only direct mail and national magazine advertising) in the future. In addition to emphasizing top line growth, management will focus on strong operational controls which have been an important factor in the Companys success. 18 Fourth Quarter 2002 Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year were $534.5 million, up 15% over 2001s fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales decreased 4% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comps for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 5%, with womens achieving positive low single digit comps and mens a mid teen negative comp. Comps for abercrombie declined 4%, with girls achieving a high single digit positive comp during the quarter and boys a negative high teen comp. Comps in Hollister were a positive 16%, with girls achieving low twenties positive comps and guys a high single digit positive comp. By region, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to strategically use direct mail and bounce back promotions, but, overall, a much less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken as compared to the 2001 fiscal year. The pre Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected, comps were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December 2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of winter clearance, and positive results from the initial Spring assortment. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops, outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there remained no solid trend industry wide. Knit tops and woven shirts performed well during the quarter. As for the kids business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in the adult mens business, boys continued to be difficult. In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed best. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The direct to consumer business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year as compared to 4.5% in the 2001 fiscal year. 19 Fiscal 2002 Net sales for the 2002 fiscal year reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over the 2001 fiscal year. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitch comps declined 6%, abercrombie comps declined 4% and Hollister comps increased 10%. The decline in comps was primarily due to the weak performance in both mens and boys. Mens comps decreased in low double digits for the 2002 fiscal year while boys comps decreased in the mid teens. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for approximately 57% of the adult and kids businesses in the 2002 fiscal year. For the year, womens comps were negative low single digits while girls comps were positive mid single digits. Hollister continued to perform well. For the 2002 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.7% of the 2002 fiscal year net sales compared to 4.2% in the 2001 fiscal year. GROSS INCOME The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). Fourth Quarter 2003 Gross income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $261.0 million compared to $243.0 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was 46.6%, up 110 basis points from last years rate of 45.5%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup (IMU), partially offset by a higher markdown rate and an increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. Continued progress in sourcing efficiency has been an important factor in improving IMU and profit. The Company continued to make progress increasing IMU in the Hollister and abercrombie business, where IMU improved over 400 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year for both concepts. All three concepts are operating at very similar margins, both in IMU and merchandise margin. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs, such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges, with a comp store decrease. The markdown rate, as a percentage of net sales, exceeded last year for the quarter due to the weaker than expected pre Christmas business resulting in aggressive markdowns in the back half of January. The Company conservatively managed its inventory and despite negative comps ended the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 3% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. 20 Fiscal 2003 For the 2003 fiscal year, gross income increased to $717.4 million from $656.0 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 42.0% versus 41.1% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were partially offset by increased buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Buying and occupancy costs increased over last year, as a percentage of net sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. Fourth Quarter 2002 Gross income for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year was $243.0 million compared to $208.5 million in the same period in the 2001 fiscal year. The gross income rate for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from the 2001 fiscal year rate of 44.7%. The increase in the gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in IMU, partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales. Continued progress in sourcing was an important factor in improving IMU in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing IMU in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year versus the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Additionally, the Companys less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs, such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges, with a comp store decrease. The Company ended the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 12% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Fiscal 2002 Gross income for the 2002 fiscal year was $656.0 million compared to $558.0 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The gross income rate was 41.1% in the 2002 fiscal year versus 40.9% in the 2001 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales. Gross income was also protected as a result of strong inventory management through most of the first half of the 2002 fiscal year. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES Fourth Quarter 2003 General, administrative and store operating expenses during fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $106.7 million compared to $93.4 million during the same period in the 2002 fiscal year. The fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 19.0% compared to 17.5% in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. The increase in rate versus the 2002 fiscal year reflects a loss of leverage due to the double digit drop in 21 comps partially offset by lower bonuses and efficiencies in store operations, distribution center operations and the direct to consumer business. During the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year, store payroll hours were reduced by 2% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and wages, in all three concepts, were held relatively flat. Store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. Overall, store expenses grew at approximately the same rate as the Companys square footage growth during the fourth quarter. The distribution center achieved record level productivity during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 18% higher than the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. This increase was on top of a 39% increase last year and a 50% increase two years ago. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Fiscal 2003 Full year general, administrative and store operating expenses were $385.8 million in the 2003 fiscal year versus $343.4 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 22.6% versus 21.5% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increased rate in the 2003 fiscal year resulted primarily from a drop in comps that could not be offset by lower variable expenses per average store. In addition, legal expense increased in the 2003 fiscal year compared to the 2002 fiscal year as the Company reserved expected defense costs for pending litigation. Partially offsetting these costs were improvements in distribution center productivity, reduced expenses per order in the direct to consumer business and reduced marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, due to savings from fewer direct mail campaigns in the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 31% higher during the 2003 fiscal year than during the 2002 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $19.3 million in the 2003 fiscal year compared to $19.9 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Fourth Quarter 2002 For the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year, general, administrative and store operating expenses were $93.4 million compared to $79.9 million in fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate was 17.5% compared to 17.1% in the same period the prior year. The increase in rate versus the 2001 fiscal year resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance. During the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store operating expense rate. Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct to consumer business. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year than the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in the 2001 fiscal year with 20% fewer labor hours. 22 Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Fiscal 2002 The general, administrative and store operating expenses for the 2002 fiscal year were $343.4 million compared to $286.6 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in the 2002 fiscal year was 21.5% versus 21.0% in the 2001 fiscal year. The 2002 fiscal year rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 46% higher during the 2002 fiscal year than during the 2001 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $19.9 million in the 2002 fiscal year versus $19.5 million the 2001 fiscal year. OPERATING INCOME Fourth Quarter 2003 Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year increased to $154.3 million from $149.6 million in the 2002 fiscal year fourth quarter. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 27.5% for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to 28.0% for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, reduced the operating income rate in the current years fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher merchandise margins during the quarter. Fiscal 2003 For the 2003 fiscal year, operating income was $331.6 million compared to $312.6 million for the 2002 fiscal year. The operating income rate for the 2003 fiscal year was 19.4% versus 19.6% in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Fourth Quarter 2002 and Fiscal 2002 Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year increased to $149.6 million from $128.6 million during the same period in the 2001 fiscal year. The operating income rate was 28.0% for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year compared to 27.6% for the fourth quarter in the 2001 fiscal year. The increase in the operating income rate was due to a higher gross income rate partially offset by a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate. In the 2002 fiscal year, the operating income was $312.6 million compared to $271.5 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The operating income rates for same time periods were 19.6% versus 19.9%. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. 23 INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income for the 2003 fiscal year were $1.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as compared with net interest income of $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline in the 2003 fiscal year fourth quarter net interest income was due to lower interest rates. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities. Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income were $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in the 2002 fiscal year as compared with net interest income of $1.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2001 fiscal year. The decrease in net interest income in the year to date period was a result of the Companys strategy, at the beginning of the 2002 fiscal year, to invest cash in tax free securities due to the decline in short term market interest rates. The investment in tax free securities lowered the Companys effective tax rate. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the commercial paper market. The effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and year to date periods of the 2003 fiscal year were 39.3% and 38.8%, respectively, as compared to 38.5% and 38.4%, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2002 fiscal year. FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income and cash on hand has afforded the Company financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund the dividend announced in February 2004. The Board of Directors will review and approve the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 Working capital $ 472,653 $ 384,094 $ 241,616 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 871,257 $ 749,527 $ 595,434 24 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2003 2002 2001 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.69 2.57 2.48 Net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands) $ 281,896 $ 293,146 $ 233,202 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the 2003 fiscal year from the 2002 fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in inventories not offset by commensurate increases in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Inventories increased from the net addition of 103 stores representing an increase of 663,000 gross square feet in 2003. Inventories at fiscal year end were 3% higher on a gross square foot basis than at the end of the 2002 fiscal year. The increase in cash from operating activities from the 2002 fiscal year from the 2001 fiscal year was primarily from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in the 2002 fiscal year due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments. Accrued expenses increased in the 2002 fiscal year primarily due to higher store expenses, consistent with the increase in store openings. The increase in income taxes payable was driven by higher pre tax income and timing of payments. The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows during the 2003 fiscal year related to investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $35 million invested in the completion of the home office expansion, improvements in the distribution center and information technology expenditures for a new point of sale system. This system was completely rolled out to all stores during the third quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Financing activities during the 2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal years consisted primarily of the repurchase of 4,401,000 shares, 1,850,000 shares, and 600,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The 2003 repurchase leaves 599,000 shares remaining as of January 31, 2004 of the 5,000,000 share repurchase authorized by the Board of Directors during its August 2002 Board meeting. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises, restricted stock issuances and overdrafts. These overdrafts are outstanding checks reclassified from cash to accounts payable. Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), which replaced both the then existing $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement and a $75 million trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $42.8 million and $41.8 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 31, 2004 or February 1, 2003. 25 The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that expire during the 2004 fiscal year but automatically renew for a period of one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. As of January 31, 2004, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Leases $ 1,002,720 $ 141,338 $ 278,417 $ 232,628 $ 350,337 Purchase Obligations and Other 143,600 143,600 Total $ 1,146,320 $ 284,938 $ 278,417 $ 232,628 $ 350,337 The majority of the Companys contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for its stores (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The purchase obligations and other category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2004, preventive maintenance contracts for the 2004 fiscal year and letters of credit outstanding as of January 31, 2004 (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by concept were as follows: January 31, 2004 February 1, 2003 Number Gross Square Number Gross Square of Stores Feet (thousands) of Stores Feet (thousands) Abercrombie & Fitch 357 3,154 340 3,036 abercrombie 171 753 164 727 Hollister 172 1,114 93 595 Total 700 5,021 597 4,358 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $99.1 million, $93.0 million and $126.5 million for the 2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal years, respectively. Additionally, the non cash accrual for construction in progress increased $18.6 million in the 2003 fiscal year, decreased $12.7 million in the 2002 fiscal year and increased $1.0 million the 2001 fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the 2003 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction in addition to approximately $35.0 million of the total capital expenditures invested in the home office expansion, distribution center projects and a new point of sale system. Capital expenditures in the 2002 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction with approximately $20.0 million invested in 26 information technology and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in the 2001 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction. Approximately $17.0 million of the total capital expenditure in the 2001 fiscal year related to the construction of a new office and distribution center. The office and distribution center were completed in the 2001 fiscal year. The Company anticipates spending $110.0 million to $120.0 million in the 2004 fiscal year for capital expenditures, of which $85.0 million to $95.0 million will be for new/remodel store construction. The balance of the capital expenditures will primarily relate to home office and distribution center projects and other miscellaneous projects. The Company intends to add approximately 745,000 gross square feet in the 2004 fiscal year, which will represent a 15% increase over year end 2003. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 15 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 85 new Hollister stores. In addition, the Company recently announced plans for a new lifestyle brand that will target an older customer than its current brands. The Company expects to open four test stores in August 2004. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 to 15 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $550,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $300,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $450,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $115,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $590,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $215,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce 27 sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the direct shipping costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At the Company, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit ("SKU") level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, 10 to 15 years for leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of 28 various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 had no impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued in June 2002. SFAS No. 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with the exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities, that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.)" SFAS No. 146 also addresses accounting and reporting standards for costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. SFAS No. 146 was effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 in first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year and adoption did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that chose to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," were permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified prospective and retroactive restatement). Companies that chose not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123 were affected by the new disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. The new interim disclosure provisions were effective for the first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year and have been adopted by the Company (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). EITF Issue No. 03 08, "Accounting for Claims Made Insurance and Retroactive Insurance Contracts by the Insured Entity," discusses the accounting implications of retroactive and prospective claims made insurance policies. The consensus reached was that a claims made insurance policy that contains no retroactive provisions should be accounted for on a prospective basis. However, if a claims made insurance policy contains a retroactive provision, the retroactive and prospective provisions of the policy should be accounted for separately, if practicable; otherwise, the claims made insurance policy should be accounted for entirely as a retroactive contract. This consensus was effective for new insurance contracts entered into beginning with the third quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The Company has evaluated the impact of this issue and concluded that there was no effect on the consolidated financial statements. EITF Issue No. 02 16, "Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received From a Vendor." The issue provides accounting guidance on how a reseller should characterize consideration given by a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. EITF Issue No. 02 16 was effective 29 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has evaluated the impact of this issue and concluded that there was no effect on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The Company adopted FIN 45 at the beginning of the 2003 fiscal year. The adoption did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 30 Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Companys control.

Except as may be required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized. 31 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities less than one year. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that an adverse change in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 32 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $560.4 million, an increase of 5% from $534.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $154.3 million compared to $149.6 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Net income increased to $94.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to $92.8 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $.96, up 3% from $.93 in the 2002 fiscal year. Net sales for the 2003 fiscal year were $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over the 2002 fiscal year net sales of $1.6 billion. Operating income for the 2003 fiscal year increased 6% to $331.6 million from $312.6 million for the 2002 fiscal year. Net income per diluted share was $2.06 for the 2003 fiscal year compared to $1.94 in the 2002 fiscal year, an increase of 6%. During the 2003 fiscal year, the Company continued its growth strategy by opening 19 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 9 abercrombie stores and 79 Hollister stores, for a total of 107 stores. Sales productivity of these new store openings continues to be high. During the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year, the new stores in all three concepts opened during the past 12 months averaged approximately the same sales per square foot as the existing store base. The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2003 2002 2001 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 58.0 58.9 59.1 GROSS INCOME 42.0 41.1 40.9 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 22.6 21.5 21.0 OPERATING INCOME 19.4 19.6 19.9 Interest Income, Net (0.2) (0.2) (0.4) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.6 19.8 20.3 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.6 7.9 NET INCOME 12.0 12.2 12.4 15 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial data compares the 2003 fiscal year to the comparable periods for 2002 and 2001: Change 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003 2001 2002 Net sales (millions) $ 1,708 $ 1,596 $ 1,365 7% 17% Decrease in comparable store sales (9)% (5)% (9)% Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, magazine, catalogue and Web sites 16% 22% 19% Retail sales per average gross $ 345 $ 379 $ 401 (9)% (5)% square foot Retail sales per average store $ 2,494 $ 2,797 $ 3,095 (11)% (10)% (thousands) Average store size at year end 7,173 7,300 7,480 (2)% (2)% (gross square feet) Gross square feet at year end 5,021 4,358 3,673 15% 19% (thousands) Number of stores and gross square feet by concept: Abercrombie & Fitch: Stores at beginning of period 340 309 265 Opened 19 33 45 Closed (2) (2) (1) Stores at end of period 357 340 309 Gross square feet (thousands) 3,154 3,036 2,798 abercrombie: Stores at beginning of period 164 148 84 Opened 9 19 64 Closed (2) (3) Stores at end of period 171 164 148 Gross square feet (thousands) 753 727 662 Hollister: Stores at beginning of period 93 34 5 Opened 79 60 29 Closed (1) Stores at end of period 172 93 34 Gross square feet (thousands) 1,114 595 213 16 NET SALES Fourth Quarter 2003 Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $560.4 million, up 5% over last years fourth quarter net sales of $534.5 million. Comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores that have been open for at least one year, decreased 11% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps") for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 14% with mens comps declining in the low twenties and womens declining by a high single digit percentage. In abercrombie, the kids business, comps decreased 7% with girls achieving a low single digit positive comp increase and boys comps declining in the low twenties. In Hollister, comps were flat when compared to last year for the quarter. Hollister girls comps were a positive low single digit for the fourth quarter, while guys comps were a negative mid single digit. On a regional basis, comp store results across all three concepts were strongest along the East Coast and in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Stores located in Florida, Southern California and the New York metropolitan area had the best comp performance. From a promotional standpoint, the Company used direct mail promotions during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year to drive business between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but did not anniversary the 2002 fourth quarter issuance of a bounce back coupon. Also, the Company did not repeat a 15% off bag stuffer coupon that impacted late December and January business in fiscal 2002. Overall, the Company sought to have a less promotional look to the stores in the 2003 fiscal year. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. In Abercrombie & Fitch, womens had strong comp store increases in the fourth quarter in knits, fleece and skirts. Weak classifications included woven shirts and outerwear. The mens business continued to be difficult. However, graphic t shirts and woven shirts were classifications that had comp increases while the sweater and outerwear classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, for the quarter, knits, sweats and pants had strong comp store increases in girls, which were somewhat offset by weak business in sweaters, shirts, outerwear and gymwear. Boys graphic tees, woven shirts and accessories had comp increases, but these increases were not sufficient to offset other weaker performing classifications. In Hollister, girls also achieved stronger comps than guys. In girls, sweats, skirts, pants and denim had significant comp store increases during the quarter, while comps in the sweater and outerwear classifications declined. In guys, woven shirts, denim and sweats had positive comp store increases. However, the sweater, knit tops and outerwear classifications had significant declines. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 42% during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year as compared to the same period during the 2002 fiscal year. The Company added a Hollister e commerce business during back to school 2003. The direct to consumer business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 6.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year as compared to 5.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. 17 Fiscal 2003 Net sales for the 2003 fiscal year reached $1.7 billion, up 7% over the 2002 fiscal year. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 103 stores partially offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. By merchandise concept, comps for the 2003 fiscal year were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 11% with mens comps declining low twenties and womens comps declining mid single digits. abercrombie comps declined 6% with girls achieving a mid single digit positive comp store increase and boys posting a negative comp in the high teens. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for approximately 63% of the adult and kids businesses in the 2003 fiscal year. Hollister comps for the 2003 fiscal year were a positive 7%, with girls comps positive in low double digits and guys slightly negative. During the year, Hollister continued to gain in productivity relative to Abercrombie & Fitch. For the 2003 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 113% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. For the 2003 fiscal year, e commerce sales grew by approximately 39% as compared to the 2002 fiscal year. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly, and the Companys Web sites represented 5.3% of net sales for the 2003 fiscal year compared to 4.7% in the 2002 fiscal year. Current Trends and Outlook The Company experienced double digit comp store increases each year from the 1996 fiscal year to the 1999 fiscal year, reaching sales per gross square foot of $505 in fiscal 1999, a level significantly higher than most of its competitors. The Company believes that the comp store decreases since then reflect both a difficult retail environment and a normalization of the Companys sales per square foot relative to its competition. The Company achieved positive comp store increases in January and February 2004 and while March 2004 comps were down slightly, the Company is encouraged by this improvement in trend. Although the Company is confident that comps will improve in the future, due to the uncertain competitive and economic environment, it cannot predict whether this will occur in the 2004 fiscal year or any subsequent year. Driving top line revenue will be the Companys priority in the 2004 fiscal year and the Company has made a number of organizational changes intended to strengthen the design and merchandising groups. Additionally, changes have been made in the Companys marketing strategies. The A&F Quarterly has been discontinued and the Company plans to use a variety of marketing vehicles (including lifestyle only direct mail and national magazine advertising) in the future. In addition to emphasizing top line growth, management will focus on strong operational controls which have been an important factor in the Companys success. 18 Fourth Quarter 2002 Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year were $534.5 million, up 15% over 2001s fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales decreased 4% for the quarter. By merchandise concept, comps for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comps declined 5%, with womens achieving positive low single digit comps and mens a mid teen negative comp. Comps for abercrombie declined 4%, with girls achieving a high single digit positive comp during the quarter and boys a negative high teen comp. Comps in Hollister were a positive 16%, with girls achieving low twenties positive comps and guys a high single digit positive comp. By region, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to strategically use direct mail and bounce back promotions, but, overall, a much less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken as compared to the 2001 fiscal year. The pre Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected, comps were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December 2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of winter clearance, and positive results from the initial Spring assortment. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops, outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there remained no solid trend industry wide. Knit tops and woven shirts performed well during the quarter. As for the kids business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in the adult mens business, boys continued to be difficult. In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed best. Sales in the e commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The direct to consumer business (which includes the Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year as compared to 4.5% in the 2001 fiscal year. 19 Fiscal 2002 Net sales for the 2002 fiscal year reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over the 2001 fiscal year. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitch comps declined 6%, abercrombie comps declined 4% and Hollister comps increased 10%. The decline in comps was primarily due to the weak performance in both mens and boys. Mens comps decreased in low double digits for the 2002 fiscal year while boys comps decreased in the mid teens. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for approximately 57% of the adult and kids businesses in the 2002 fiscal year. For the year, womens comps were negative low single digits while girls comps were positive mid single digits. Hollister continued to perform well. For the 2002 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls. The Companys catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Companys Web sites represented 4.7% of the 2002 fiscal year net sales compared to 4.2% in the 2001 fiscal year. GROSS INCOME The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). Fourth Quarter 2003 Gross income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $261.0 million compared to $243.0 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was 46.6%, up 110 basis points from last years rate of 45.5%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup (IMU), partially offset by a higher markdown rate and an increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales. Continued progress in sourcing efficiency has been an important factor in improving IMU and profit. The Company continued to make progress increasing IMU in the Hollister and abercrombie business, where IMU improved over 400 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year for both concepts. All three concepts are operating at very similar margins, both in IMU and merchandise margin. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs, such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges, with a comp store decrease. The markdown rate, as a percentage of net sales, exceeded last year for the quarter due to the weaker than expected pre Christmas business resulting in aggressive markdowns in the back half of January. The Company conservatively managed its inventory and despite negative comps ended the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 3% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. 20 Fiscal 2003 For the 2003 fiscal year, gross income increased to $717.4 million from $656.0 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 42.0% versus 41.1% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were partially offset by increased buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Buying and occupancy costs increased over last year, as a percentage of net sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. Fourth Quarter 2002 Gross income for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year was $243.0 million compared to $208.5 million in the same period in the 2001 fiscal year. The gross income rate for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from the 2001 fiscal year rate of 44.7%. The increase in the gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in IMU, partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales. Continued progress in sourcing was an important factor in improving IMU in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing IMU in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year versus the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Additionally, the Companys less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs, such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges, with a comp store decrease. The Company ended the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 12% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Fiscal 2002 Gross income for the 2002 fiscal year was $656.0 million compared to $558.0 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The gross income rate was 41.1% in the 2002 fiscal year versus 40.9% in the 2001 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales. Gross income was also protected as a result of strong inventory management through most of the first half of the 2002 fiscal year. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES Fourth Quarter 2003 General, administrative and store operating expenses during fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $106.7 million compared to $93.4 million during the same period in the 2002 fiscal year. The fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 19.0% compared to 17.5% in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. The increase in rate versus the 2002 fiscal year reflects a loss of leverage due to the double digit drop in 21 comps partially offset by lower bonuses and efficiencies in store operations, distribution center operations and the direct to consumer business. During the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year, store payroll hours were reduced by 2% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and wages, in all three concepts, were held relatively flat. Store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. Overall, store expenses grew at approximately the same rate as the Companys square footage growth during the fourth quarter. The distribution center achieved record level productivity during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 18% higher than the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. This increase was on top of a 39% increase last year and a 50% increase two years ago. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Fiscal 2003 Full year general, administrative and store operating expenses were $385.8 million in the 2003 fiscal year versus $343.4 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 22.6% versus 21.5% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increased rate in the 2003 fiscal year resulted primarily from a drop in comps that could not be offset by lower variable expenses per average store. In addition, legal expense increased in the 2003 fiscal year compared to the 2002 fiscal year as the Company reserved expected defense costs for pending litigation. Partially offsetting these costs were improvements in distribution center productivity, reduced expenses per order in the direct to consumer business and reduced marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, due to savings from fewer direct mail campaigns in the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 31% higher during the 2003 fiscal year than during the 2002 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $19.3 million in the 2003 fiscal year compared to $19.9 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Fourth Quarter 2002 For the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year, general, administrative and store operating expenses were $93.4 million compared to $79.9 million in fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate was 17.5% compared to 17.1% in the same period the prior year. The increase in rate versus the 2001 fiscal year resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance. During the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store operating expense rate. Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct to consumer business. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher during the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year than the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in the 2001 fiscal year with 20% fewer labor hours. 22 Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year. Fiscal 2002 The general, administrative and store operating expenses for the 2002 fiscal year were $343.4 million compared to $286.6 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in the 2002 fiscal year was 21.5% versus 21.0% in the 2001 fiscal year. The 2002 fiscal year rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 46% higher during the 2002 fiscal year than during the 2001 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the e commerce and catalogue sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $19.9 million in the 2002 fiscal year versus $19.5 million the 2001 fiscal year. OPERATING INCOME Fourth Quarter 2003 Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year increased to $154.3 million from $149.6 million in the 2002 fiscal year fourth quarter. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 27.5% for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to 28.0% for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, reduced the operating income rate in the current years fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher merchandise margins during the quarter. Fiscal 2003 For the 2003 fiscal year, operating income was $331.6 million compared to $312.6 million for the 2002 fiscal year. The operating income rate for the 2003 fiscal year was 19.4% versus 19.6% in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Fourth Quarter 2002 and Fiscal 2002 Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year increased to $149.6 million from $128.6 million during the same period in the 2001 fiscal year. The operating income rate was 28.0% for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year compared to 27.6% for the fourth quarter in the 2001 fiscal year. The increase in the operating income rate was due to a higher gross income rate partially offset by a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate. In the 2002 fiscal year, the operating income was $312.6 million compared to $271.5 million in the 2001 fiscal year. The operating income rates for same time periods were 19.6% versus 19.9%. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. 23 INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income for the 2003 fiscal year were $1.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as compared with net interest income of $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline in the 2003 fiscal year fourth quarter net interest income was due to lower interest rates. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities. Fourth quarter and year to date net interest income were $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in the 2002 fiscal year as compared with net interest income of $1.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2001 fiscal year. The decrease in net interest income in the year to date period was a result of the Companys strategy, at the beginning of the 2002 fiscal year, to invest cash in tax free securities due to the decline in short term market interest rates. The investment in tax free securities lowered the Companys effective tax rate. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the commercial paper market. The effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and year to date periods of the 2003 fiscal year were 39.3% and 38.8%, respectively, as compared to 38.5% and 38.4%, respectively, for the comparable periods in the 2002 fiscal year. FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income and cash on hand has afforded the Company financial strength and flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities provides the resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund the dividend announced in February 2004. The Board of Directors will review and approve the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 Working capital $ 472,653 $ 384,094 $ 241,616 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 871,257 $ 749,527 $ 595,434 24 The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2003 2002 2001 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.69 2.57 2.48 Net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands) $ 281,896 $ 293,146 $ 233,202 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the 2003 fiscal year from the 2002 fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in inventories not offset by commensurate increases in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Inventories increased from the net addition of 103 stores representing an increase of 663,000 gross square feet in 2003. Inventories at fiscal year end were 3% higher on a gross square foot basis than at the end of the 2002 fiscal year. The increase in cash from operating activities from the 2002 fiscal year from the 2001 fiscal year was primarily from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in the 2002 fiscal year due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments. Accrued expenses increased in the 2002 fiscal year primarily due to higher store expenses, consistent with the increase in store openings. The increase in income taxes payable was driven by higher pre tax income and timing of payments. The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the back to school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows during the 2003 fiscal year related to investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below) related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $35 million invested in the completion of the home office expansion, improvements in the distribution center and information technology expenditures for a new point of sale system. This system was completely rolled out to all stores during the third quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Financing activities during the 2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal years consisted primarily of the repurchase of 4,401,000 shares, 1,850,000 shares, and 600,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The 2003 repurchase leaves 599,000 shares remaining as of January 31, 2004 of the 5,000,000 share repurchase authorized by the Board of Directors during its August 2002 Board meeting. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises, restricted stock issuances and overdrafts. These overdrafts are outstanding checks reclassified from cash to accounts payable. Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), which replaced both the then existing $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement and a $75 million trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $42.8 million and $41.8 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 31, 2004 or February 1, 2003. 25 The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that expire during the 2004 fiscal year but automatically renew for a period of one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. As of January 31, 2004, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Leases $ 1,002,720 $ 141,338 $ 278,417 $ 232,628 $ 350,337 Purchase Obligations and Other 143,600 143,600 Total $ 1,146,320 $ 284,938 $ 278,417 $ 232,628 $ 350,337 The majority of the Companys contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for its stores (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The purchase obligations and other category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2004, preventive maintenance contracts for the 2004 fiscal year and letters of credit outstanding as of January 31, 2004 (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by concept were as follows: January 31, 2004 February 1, 2003 Number Gross Square Number Gross Square of Stores Feet (thousands) of Stores Feet (thousands) Abercrombie & Fitch 357 3,154 340 3,036 abercrombie 171 753 164 727 Hollister 172 1,114 93 595 Total 700 5,021 597 4,358 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $99.1 million, $93.0 million and $126.5 million for the 2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal years, respectively. Additionally, the non cash accrual for construction in progress increased $18.6 million in the 2003 fiscal year, decreased $12.7 million in the 2002 fiscal year and increased $1.0 million the 2001 fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the 2003 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction in addition to approximately $35.0 million of the total capital expenditures invested in the home office expansion, distribution center projects and a new point of sale system. Capital expenditures in the 2002 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction with approximately $20.0 million invested in 26 information technology and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in the 2001 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction. Approximately $17.0 million of the total capital expenditure in the 2001 fiscal year related to the construction of a new office and distribution center. The office and distribution center were completed in the 2001 fiscal year. The Company anticipates spending $110.0 million to $120.0 million in the 2004 fiscal year for capital expenditures, of which $85.0 million to $95.0 million will be for new/remodel store construction. The balance of the capital expenditures will primarily relate to home office and distribution center projects and other miscellaneous projects. The Company intends to add approximately 745,000 gross square feet in the 2004 fiscal year, which will represent a 15% increase over year end 2003. It is anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 15 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 85 new Hollister stores. In addition, the Company recently announced plans for a new lifestyle brand that will target an older customer than its current brands. The Company expects to open four test stores in August 2004. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 to 15 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $550,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $300,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $450,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $115,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for Hollister stores opened during the 2004 fiscal year will approximate $590,000 per store, net of landlord allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $215,000 per store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce 27 sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the direct shipping costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At the Company, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit ("SKU") level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, 10 to 15 years for leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of 28 various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 had no impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued in June 2002. SFAS No. 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with the exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities, that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.)" SFAS No. 146 also addresses accounting and reporting standards for costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. SFAS No. 146 was effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 in first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year and adoption did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that chose to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," were permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified prospective and retroactive restatement). Companies that chose not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123 were affected by the new disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. The new interim disclosure provisions were effective for the first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year and have been adopted by the Company (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). EITF Issue No. 03 08, "Accounting for Claims Made Insurance and Retroactive Insurance Contracts by the Insured Entity," discusses the accounting implications of retroactive and prospective claims made insurance policies. The consensus reached was that a claims made insurance policy that contains no retroactive provisions should be accounted for on a prospective basis. However, if a claims made insurance policy contains a retroactive provision, the retroactive and prospective provisions of the policy should be accounted for separately, if practicable; otherwise, the claims made insurance policy should be accounted for entirely as a retroactive contract. This consensus was effective for new insurance contracts entered into beginning with the third quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The Company has evaluated the impact of this issue and concluded that there was no effect on the consolidated financial statements. EITF Issue No. 02 16, "Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received From a Vendor." The issue provides accounting guidance on how a reseller should characterize consideration given by a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. EITF Issue No. 02 16 was effective 29 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has evaluated the impact of this issue and concluded that there was no effect on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The Company adopted FIN 45 at the beginning of the 2003 fiscal year. The adoption did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 30 Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A&F cautions that any forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10 K or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Companys control. Words such as "estimate," "project," "plan," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," and similar expressions may identify forward looking statements. The following factors, in addition to those included in the disclosure under the heading "RISK FACTORS" in "ITEM 1. BUSINESS" of A&Fs Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 , in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Companys financial performance and could cause actual results for the 2004 fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; postal rate increases and changes; paper and printing costs; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability are difficult to predict. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties in the forward looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company, or any other person, that the objectives of the Company will be achieved. The forward looking statements herein are based on information presently available to the management of the Company. Except as may be required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized. 31 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable securities with original maturities less than one year. These financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that an adverse change in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 32
