ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During the 2004 fiscal year, the Company made solid progress in executing its strategic priority to build and maintain the aspirational positioning of its brands. An integral part of this strategy was to reduce the overall level of promotions to emphasize the superior quality of its brands. In addition, the Company increased its spending in its retail stores to improve the overall customer experience and reduce the level of shrink. The Company had net sales of $2.021 billion in fiscal 2004, up 18.3% versus net sales in the fiscal 2003 period. Net income was $216.4 million in fiscal 2004, up 5.7% versus the 2003 fiscal year. Operating income for the 2004 fiscal year increased 5.0% to $347.6 million from $331.2 million for the 2003 fiscal year. Operating income included a $40.9 million accrual for the expected settlement of three related class action employment discrimination lawsuits. Net income per weighted average diluted share was $2.28 for the 2004 fiscal year compared to $2.06 in the 2003 fiscal year, an increase of 10.7%. The Company generated cash from operations of $426.1 million in fiscal 2004 versus $342.5 million in fiscal 2003 resulting primarily from strong earnings coupled with disciplined inventory management. The Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, opening 84 Hollister stores, 16 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 9 abercrombie stores and 4 RUEHL stores, and remodeling 14 Abercrombie & Fitch stores. Further, the Company used excess cash to repurchase 11.2 million shares of common stock for $434.7 million and pay dividends of $0.50 per share. Cash distributions to shareholders will continue to be an important way to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys first priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. Further, the Company is committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility. Therefore, the Company plans to retain approximately $300 to $350 million of cash and marketable securities, subject to a variety of factors including inventory purchases and the timing of certain payments. 24 The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2004 2003 2002 NET SALES 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs 55.0 58.0 58.9 GROSS INCOME 45.0 42.0 41.1 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 27.8(1) 22.6 21.5 OPERATING INCOME 17.2 19.4 19.6 Interest Income, Net (0.3) (0.2) (0.2) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 17.5 19.6 19.8 Provision for Income Taxes 6.8 7.6 7.6 NET INCOME 10.7 12.0 12.2 (1) Includes 2.0% related to the settlement of the class action diversity lawsuits. 25 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized operational data compares fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002: Change 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004 2002 2003 Net sales (thousands) $2,021,253 $1,707,810 $1,595,757 18% 7% Net sales by brand Abercrombie & Fitch 1,210,222 1,180,646 1,238,498 3% (5)% abercrombie 227,204 212,276 207,537 7% 2% Hollister 579,687 314,888 149,722 84% 110% RUEHL* 4,140 n/a n/a n/a n/a Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales Abercrombie & Fitch (1)% (11)% (6)% abercrombie 1% (6)% (4)% Hollister 13% 7% 10% Retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, catalogue and web sites 16% 16% 22% Retail sales per average gross square foot Abercrombie & Fitch $ 352 $ 358 $ 407 (2)% (12)% abercrombie $ 282 $ 270 $ 286 4% (6)% Hollister $ 423 $ 404 $ 385 5% 5% RUEHL* $ 136 n/a n/a n/a n/a Retail sales per average store (thousands) Abercrombie & Fitch $ 3,103 $ 3,184 $ 3,652 (3)% (13)% abercrombie $ 1,241 $ 1,194 $ 1,271 4% (6)% Hollister $ 2,740 $ 2,594 $ 2,450 6% 6% RUEHL* $ 1,255 n/a n/a n/a n/a Sales statistics per average store Number of transactions Abercrombie & Fitch 45,941 51,234 59,832 (10)% (14)% abercrombie 21,740 22,128 23,210 (2)% (5)% Hollister 56,687 57,593 58,648 (2)% (2)% RUEHL* 12,913 n/a n/a n/a n/a Average transaction value Abercrombie & Fitch $ 67.54 $ 62.15 $ 61.04 9% 2% abercrombie $ 57.10 $ 53.98 $ 54.77 6% (1)% Hollister $ 48.33 $ 45.04 $ 41.78 7% 8% RUEHL* $ 97.16 n/a n/a n/a n/a Units per transaction Abercrombie & Fitch 2.22 2.24 2.22 (1)% 1% abercrombie 2.68 2.68 2.70 nm (1)% Hollister 2.18 2.14 2.00 2% 7% RUEHL* 2.17 n/a n/a n/a n/a Average unit value Abercrombie & Fitch $ 30.42 $ 27.75 $ 27.50 10% 1% abercrombie $ 21.31 $ 20.14 $ 20.29 6% (1)% Hollister $ 22.17 $ 21.05 $ 20.89 5% 1% RUEHL* $ 44.77 n/a n/a n/a n/a * Net Sales for RUEHL, and the related statistics, reflect the activity of three stores opened in September 2004 and one store opened in December 2004. 26 FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK The Companys focus is on building, maintaining and managing the aspirational positioning of its brands. Management believes that this strategy will allow the Company to maintain high margins over the long term while driving the Companys growth in sales and profits through the development of new brands. Management expects Hollister to be a significant growth vehicle for the Company domestically, while it continues to differentiate the Abercrombie & Fitch brand from the competition by emphasizing high quality and fashion content. Management believes that Abercrombie & Fitchs success will continue to favorably impact abercrombies business. While the Company is encouraged by the results of the RUEHL launch, the brand is still in its early development and as such the Company expects RUEHL to sustain operating losses in 2005 and 2006. In order to achieve and, thereafter, maintain the aspirational positioning of the brands, the Company will continue to manage its expenditures to maintain and enhance the current store base and complement the new stores being opened. The Company will also continue its store investment program to focus on improving the customers in store experience through enhanced customer service and improved merchandise presentation. Further, the Company expects to invest in higher inventories to ensure in stock size and color assortments. While these initiatives will increase the Companys selling costs, management believes the enhanced aspirational image of the Companys brands and improved customer service will have a positive impact on the Companys sales and profit performance. The Company is planning to open up to five stores in Canada during fiscal 2005. Further, in February 2005, the Company established two European subsidiaries that are expected to begin opening stores in Europe by 2006. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year were $687.3 million, up 22.6% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $560.4 million. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 88 stores during the 2004 fiscal year, a comparable store sales increase of 9% for the quarter and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales of $11.1 million versus the comparable period in the 2003 fiscal year. By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitch increased 4% with mens comparable store sales increasing by a high single digit percentage and womens increasing by a low single digit percentage. abercrombie, the kids business, achieved a 16% increase in comparable store sales with girls attaining a high teen positive increase and boys increasing by a low double digit percentage. In Hollister, comparable store sales increased by 19% for the fourth quarter with guys posting a high teen increase and girls realizing an increase in the low twenties. On a regional basis, comparable store sales results across all three brands were strongest along the East Coast and in the West and weakest in the Midwest. However, all regions reported positive comparable store sales for the quarter. Stores located in New York City metropolitan area, Florida, Philadelphia metropolitan area and Southern California had the best comparable store sales performance. 27 The Company committed to a more aspirational and less promotional strategy in early 2004 which it maintained throughout the year. As such, the Company did not anniversary the direct mail promotions used during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year to drive business between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In Abercrombie & Fitch, the mens comparable store sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong performances in graphic tees, denim, and woven shirts. Womens comparable store sales growth was driven by an increase in polos, denim and fleece, offset by a decrease in sweaters. In the kids business, for the quarter, girls had comparable store sales increases across most of the categories, especially polos, denim and graphic tees. Boys comparable store sales increase was driven by graphic tees, denim and fleece. In Hollister, girls achieved a slightly higher comparable store sales increase than guys. In girls, polos, denim and fleece had strong comparable store sales increases. The increase in the guys comparable store sales was the result of a strong performance in graphic tees, denim and woven shirts categories for the quarter. The impact of the four RUEHL stores was immaterial to the Companys total net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year, were $40.1 million, an increase of 29.4% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $31.0 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $5.5 million in 2004 and $3.5 million in 2003. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to 6.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Gross Income The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to direct to consumer sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). Gross income during the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year was $336.6 million compared to $261.5 million in the 2003 fiscal year. The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year was 49.0%, up 230 basis points from last years rate of 46.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from lower markdowns and an increase in initial markup (IMU) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 versus fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, partially offset by the lower margin of RUEHL. The improvement in IMU during the fourth quarter was a result of higher unit retail pricing in Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister. The three brands had IMU improvements compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 and operated at similar margins. The Company ended the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 11% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The inventory increase reflected a planned shift in the timing of Spring and denim merchandise deliveries. 28 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses General, administrative and store operating expenses during fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year were $166.4 million compared to $106.7 million during the same period in 2003. During the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year, general, administrative and store operating expense rate (general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was 24.2% compared to 19.0% in the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The increase in the percentage of net sales versus the 2003 comparable period was primarily related to the following: higher store expenses due to an increase in aggregate payroll which represented 250 basis points of the increase and higher incentive compensation bonus accruals resulting from improved financial performance, which represented 160 basis points of the increase. Wage levels, in Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister decreased, compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The decrease in wage levels was due to an increase in part time hours in order to provide better customer service at the stores which resulted in a higher proportion of part time employees at lower rates of pay than the comparable period last year. The distribution center continued to achieve record levels of productivity during the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 10% higher than the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer net sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $6.1 million for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year compared to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year increased to $170.2 million from $154.8 million in the 2003 fiscal year fourth quarter, an increase of 10.0%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 24.8% for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year compared to 27.6% for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The decrease in the operating income rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was a result of higher general, administrative and store operating expenses during the quarter, partially offset by higher gross income resulting from higher unit retail pricing in Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister. Interest Income and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $1.3 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.1 million during the comparable period in fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest income was due to higher rates during the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year when compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities for the majority of the quarter and then changed its investing strategy to taxable money market investments. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39.2% compared to 39.3% for the 2003 comparable period. 29 Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year was $104.3 million versus $94.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of 10.3%. The increase in net income was the result of higher net sales and higher gross income partially offset by increased spending in general, administrative and store operating expenses. Net income per weighted average diluted share outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $1.15 versus $0.97 for the same period last year, an increase of 18.6%. Net income per share increased by more than net income as a result of the Companys share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year the Company had weighted average basic shares outstanding of 87.6 million versus 96.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. FISCAL 2004 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the 2004 fiscal year were $2.021 billion, an increase of 18.3% versus the 2003 fiscal year net sales of $1.708 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 88 stores during the 2004 fiscal year, an increase in comparable stores sales of 2% for the year and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales of $35.6 million versus the 2003 fiscal year. For the fiscal year, comparable store sales by brand were the following: Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1%; abercrombie increased 1%; Hollister increased 13%; and the womens and girls businesses in each brand continued to be more significant than the mens and boys. During the 2004 fiscal year, womens and girls represented over 60% of the net sales for each of the brands. Hollister girls achieved a mid teen increase and abercrombie girls posted a mid single digit increase in comparable store sales for the 2004 fiscal year, while Abercrombie & Fitch womens had a low single digit decrease. For the 2004 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 135% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls compared to 113% for the 2003 fiscal year. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, for the 2004 fiscal year were $110.6 million, an increase of 37.6% versus last years net sales of $80.4 million for the comparable period. Shipping and handling revenue was $15.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $10.2 million in fiscal 2003. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.2% of net sales compared to 5.3% of net sales for the 2004 and 2003 fiscal years, respectively. The impact of the four RUEHL stores opened during the fall of fiscal 2004 was immaterial to the Companys total net sales for the 2004 fiscal year. 30 Gross Income The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). For the 2004 fiscal year, gross income increased to $909.8 million from $716.9 million in the 2003 fiscal year. The gross income rate in the 2004 fiscal year was 45.0% versus 42.0% in the 2003 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU across all three brands due to higher average unit retail pricing, especially in Abercrombie & Fitch. General, Administrative and Store Operating Costs Full year general, administrative and store operating expenses were $562.2 million in the 2004 fiscal year versus $385.8 million in the 2003 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2004 was 27.8% versus 22.6% in 2003. The increased rate during the 2004 fiscal year period was primarily due to higher home office and store expenses. Home office expenses increased largely due to the accrual for the settlement of three related class action employment discrimination lawsuits which represented 200 basis points and higher incentive compensation accruals resulting from improved financial performance during the year which represented 90 basis points. Store expenses increased due to an increase in aggregate payroll which represented 150 basis points. Wage levels in Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister decreased in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease in wage levels was due to an increase in part time hours in order to provide better customer service at the stores which resulted in a higher proportion of part time employees at lower rates of pay than last year. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 10% higher during the 2004 fiscal year than during the 2003 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $20.3 million and $19.3 million for the 2004 and 2003 fiscal years, respectively. Operating Income For the 2004 fiscal year, operating income was $347.6 million compared to $331.2 million for the 2003 fiscal year, an increase of 5.0%. The operating income rate for the 2004 fiscal year was 17.2% versus 19.4% in the 2003 fiscal year. The decline was primarily due to the accrual for the settlement of three related class action employment discrimination lawsuits and higher payroll expense at both the home office and stores. The decline was partially offset by sales increases, due to the increase in comparable store sales and new stores, higher gross margin and increases in average unit retail pricing in Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister. Interest Income and Income Taxes Net interest income for the 2004 fiscal year was $5.2 million compared to $3.7 million for the 2003 fiscal year. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in rates and average cash balances for the 2004 fiscal year when compared to the 2003 fiscal year. Beginning in January 2005, the Company began investing in taxable money market investments; prior thereto, the Company invested in tax free securities. The effective tax rate for the 2004 fiscal year was 38.7% compared to 38.8% for the 2003 fiscal year. 31 Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the 2004 fiscal year was $216.4 million versus $204.8 million for the 2003 fiscal year, an increase of 5.6%. Net income for 2004 included the after tax impact of the settlement of three class action employment discrimination lawsuits of $25.1 million. Net income per weighted average diluted share was $2.28 in the fiscal 2004 year versus $2.06 in the fiscal 2003 year, an increase of 10.7%. The increase in net income per diluted share outstanding versus net income was due to the Companys share repurchase program in fiscal 2004. The Company repurchased 11.2 million shares in fiscal 2004 versus 4.4 million shares in fiscal 2003. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 FOURTH QUARTER 2003 Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $560.4 million, up 4.8% versus 2002 fourth quarter net sales of $534.5 million. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 103 stores and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales of $8.2 million versus the comparable period in the 2002 fiscal year, offset by an 11% decrease in comparable store sales during the quarter. By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs comparable store sales declined 14% with mens declining in the low twenties and womens declining by a high single digit percentage. In abercrombie, comparable store sales decreased 7% with girls achieving a low single digit positive increase and boys declining in the low twenties. In Hollister, comparable store sales were flat when compared to fiscal 2002 for the quarter. Hollister girls comparable store sales were a positive low single digit for the fourth quarter, while guys were a negative mid single digit. On a regional basis, comparable store sales results across all three brands were strongest along the East Coast and in the West and weakest in the Midwest. Stores located in Florida, Southern California and the New York metropolitan area had the best comparable store sales performance. From a promotional standpoint, the Company used direct mail promotions during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year to drive business between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but did not anniversary the 2002 fourth quarter issuance of a bounce back coupon. Also, the Company did not repeat a 15% off bag stuffer coupon that impacted late December and January business in fiscal 2002. Overall, the Company sought to have a less promotional look to the stores in the 2003 fiscal year. From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. In Abercrombie & Fitch, womens had strong comparable store sales increases in the fourth quarter in knits, fleece and skirts. Weak classifications included woven shirts and outerwear. The mens business continued to be difficult. However, graphic tees and woven shirts were classifications that had comparable store sales increases while the sweater and outerwear classifications had significant decreases. In the kids business, for the quarter, knits, sweats and pants had strong comparable store sales increases in girls, which were somewhat offset by weak business in sweaters, shirts, outerwear and gymwear. Boys graphic tees, woven shirts and accessories had comparable store sales increases, but these increases were not sufficient to offset other weaker performing classifications. 32 In Hollister, girls also achieved stronger comparable store sales than guys. In girls, sweats, skirts, pants and denim had significant comparable store sales increases during the quarter, while the sweater and outerwear classifications declined. In guys, woven shirts, denim and sweats had positive comparable store sales increases. However, the sweater, knit tops and outerwear classifications had significant declines. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales through the Companys web sites, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and catalogue for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $31.0 million, an increase of 28.6% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $24.1 million. The Company added a Hollister e commerce business during Back to School 2003. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $3.5 million in 2003 and $2.2 million in 2002. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to 4.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Gross Income The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). Gross income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $261.5 million compared to $244.2 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was 46.7%, up 100 basis points from the 2002 rate of 45.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in IMU, partially offset by a higher markdown rate and an increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales. Continued progress in sourcing efficiency was an important factor in improving IMU and profit. The Company continued to make progress increasing IMU in the Hollister and abercrombie business, where IMU improved over 400 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year for both concepts. All three concepts operated at very similar margins, both in IMU and merchandise margin. The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of net sales, reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs, such as rent, depreciation and other real estate related charges, with a comparable stores sales decrease. The markdown rate, as a percentage of net sales, exceeded fiscal 2002s fourth quarter due to the weaker than expected pre Christmas business resulting in aggressive markdowns in the back half of January. The Company conservatively managed its inventory and despite negative comparable store sales ended the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year with inventories, at cost, up 3% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses General, administrative and store operating expenses during fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year were $106.7 million compared to $93.4 million during the same period in the 2002 fiscal year. The fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year general, administrative and store operating expense rate was 19.0% compared to 17.5% in the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. The increase in rate versus the 2002 fiscal year reflects a loss of leverage due to the double digit drop in comparable store sales partially offset by lower bonuses and efficiencies in store operations, distribution center operations and the direct to consumer business. 33 During the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year, store payroll hours were reduced by 2% per average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and wages, in all three concepts, were held relatively flat. Store hours were managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume. Overall, store expenses grew at approximately the same rate as the Companys square footage growth during the fourth quarter. The distribution center achieved record level productivity during the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 18% higher than the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. This increase was on top of a 39% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and a 50% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Operating Income Operating income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year increased to $154.8 million from $150.8 million in the 2002 fiscal year fourth quarter. The operating income rate was 27.6% for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year compared to 28.2% for the fourth quarter of the 2002 fiscal year. Higher general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, reduced the operating income rate in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher merchandise margins during the quarter. Interest Income and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income for the 2003 fiscal year was $1.1 million compared with net interest income of $1.3 million for the comparable period in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline in the 2003 fiscal year fourth quarter net interest income was due to lower interest rates. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39.3% compared to 38.5% for the 2002 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year was $94.6 million versus $93.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2002, an increase of 1.2%. The increase in net income was the result of higher net sales and higher gross income partially offset by increased spending in general, administrative and store operating expenses. Net income per weighted average diluted share outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $0.97 versus $0.94 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, an increase of 3.2%. Net income per share increased by more than net income as a result of the Companys share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of the 2003 fiscal year the Company had weighted average basic shares outstanding of 96.1 million versus 97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. 34 FISCAL 2003 Net Sales Net sales for the 2003 fiscal year reached $1.708 billion, an increase of 7.0% versus the 2002 fiscal year net sales of $1.596 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 103 stores and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales of $16.9 million versus the 2002 fiscal year, offset by a 9% decrease in comparable store sales for the year. By merchandise concept, comparable store sales for the 2003 fiscal year were as follows: Abercrombie & Fitchs declined 11% with mens declining in the low twenties and womens declining by mid single digits. abercrombie comparable store sales declined 6% with girls achieving a mid single digit increase and boys posting a high teen decrease. Overall, the womens and girls businesses continued to increase in share of the total business and accounted for approximately 63% of the adults and kids businesses in the 2003 fiscal year. Hollister comparable store sales for the 2003 fiscal year increased 7%, with girls achieving a low double digits increase and guys a slight decrease. During the year, Hollister continued to gain in productivity relative to Abercrombie & Fitch. For the 2003 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were approximately 113% of the sales per square foot of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls compared to 86% for the 2002 fiscal year. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales through the Companys web sites, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and catalogue for the 2003 fiscal year were $80.4 million, an increase of 22.0% versus net sales of $65.9 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2002. The Company added a Hollister direct to consumer business during Back to School 2003. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $10.2 million in 2003 and $7.8 million in 2002. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.3% of net sales compared to 4.6% for the 2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively. Gross Income The Companys gross income may not be comparable to those of other retailers since all significant costs related to the Companys distribution network, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, are included in general, administrative and store operating expenses (see "General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses" section below). For the 2003 fiscal year, gross income increased to $716.9 million from $655.7 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The gross income rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 42.0% versus 41.1% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were partially offset by increased buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Buying and occupancy costs increased versus fiscal 2002, as a percentage of net sales, due to the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store. 35 General Administrative and Store Operating Expenses Full year general, administrative and store operating expenses were $385.8 million in the 2003 fiscal year versus $343.4 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate in the 2003 fiscal year was 22.6% versus 21.5% in the 2002 fiscal year. The increased rate in the 2003 fiscal year resulted primarily from a drop in comparable store sales that could not be offset by lower variable expenses per average store. In addition, legal expense increased in the 2003 fiscal year compared to the 2002 fiscal year as the Company reserved expected defense costs for pending litigation. Partially offsetting these costs were improvements in distribution center productivity, reduced expenses per order in the direct to consumer business and reduced marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, due to savings from fewer direct mail campaigns in the 2003 fiscal year. Productivity at the distribution center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was 31% higher during the 2003 fiscal year than during the 2002 fiscal year. Costs related to the distribution center, excluding direct shipping costs related to the direct to consumer sales, included in general, administrative and store operating expenses were $19.3 million in the 2003 fiscal year compared to $19.9 million in the 2002 fiscal year. Operating Income For the 2003 fiscal year, operating income was $331.2 million compared to $312.3 million for the 2002 fiscal year. The operating income rate for the 2003 fiscal year was 19.4% versus 19.6% in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline was attributable to a higher general, administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comparable store sales decrease. The increased expense rate was partially offset by a gross income rate increase. Interest Income and Income Taxes Net interest income for the 2003 fiscal year was $3.7 million compared to $3.8 million in the 2002 fiscal year. The decline in the 2003 fiscal year net interest income was due to lower interest rates. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities. The effective tax rate for the 2003 fiscal year was 38.8% compared to 38.4% for the 2002 fiscal year. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the 2003 fiscal year was $204.8 million versus $194.8 million for the 2002 fiscal year, an increase of 5.1%. Net income per weighted average diluted share was $2.06 in the fiscal 2003 year versus $1.94 in the fiscal 2002 year, an increase of 6.2%. The increase in net income per diluted share outstanding versus net income was due to the Companys repurchase program in fiscal 2003. The Company repurchased 4.4 million shares in fiscal 2003 versus 1.9 million shares in fiscal 2002. 36 FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income resulted in higher cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company believes cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will provide adequate resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.125 per quarter. The Board of Directors will review and approve the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization follows (in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Working capital $ 238,412 $ 441,583 $ 357,585 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 669,326 $ 857,765 $ 736,307 The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2004 versus fiscal 2003 was the result of lower cash and marketable securities resulting primarily from the Companys repurchase of 11.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $434.7 million. The increase in working capital in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities. The Company considers the following to be measures of liquidity and capital resources: 2004 2003 2002 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.58 2.42 2.32 Net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands) $ 426,125 $ 342,545 $ 345,832 The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the 2004 fiscal year from the 2003 fiscal year was primarily driven by increases in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, lessor construction allowances received and income taxes. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the accrual for the settlement of three related class action employment discrimination lawsuits, for rent due to the net addition of 88 stores, representing an increase of 574,000 gross square feet in 2004, and increases in accounts payable for the purchase of merchandise. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the 2003 fiscal year from the 2002 fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in inventories not offset by commensurate increases in net income, lessor construction allowances received, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Inventories increased from the net addition of 103 stores representing an increase of 658,000 gross square feet in 2003. Inventories at fiscal year end were 3% higher on a per gross square foot basis than at the end of the 2002 fiscal year. 37 The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the 2002 fiscal year from the 2001 fiscal year was primarily due to increases in lessor construction allowances, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and income taxes payable. Accounts payable increased in the 2002 fiscal year due to both the increased level of inventory and timing of payments. Accrued expenses increased in the 2002 fiscal year primarily due to higher store expenses, consistent with the increase in store openings. The increase in income taxes payable was driven by higher pre tax income and timing of payments. The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest during these periods. Cash outflows during the 2004 fiscal year related to investing activities were primarily for purchase of marketable securities and for capital expenditures related to new stores, the remodeling of existing stores, expenditures in home office, improvements in the distribution center, and information technology expenditures. See "Capital Expenditures and Lessor Construction Allowances". Cash inflows from investing activities consisted of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. As of January 29, 2005, all investments had original maturities of less than 90 days and accordingly were classified as cash equivalents. Cash outflows during the 2003 fiscal year also related to purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures related to new stores with approximately $35 million invested in the completion of the home office expansion, improvements in the distribution center and information technology expenditures for a new point of sale system. This system was completely rolled out to all stores during the third quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Cash inflows from investing activities consisted of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. As of January 31, 2004, the Company held $464.7 million of marketable securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days. Financing activities during the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years consisted primarily of the repurchase of 11,150,500 shares, 4,401,000 shares, and 1,850,000 shares, respectively, of A&Fs Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs. After the repurchases in 2004, the Company had 1,448,500 shares available to repurchase as of January 29, 2005 of the 6,000,000 shares authorized by the Board of Directors in November 2004. In addition to stock repurchases, financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises, restricted stock issuances and overdrafts. These overdrafts are outstanding checks reclassified from cash to accounts payable. Effective December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement, (the "Amended Credit Agreement") which extended the original agreement, dated November 14, 2002 (the "Original Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement will expire on December 15, 2009. The primary purpose of the Amended Credit Agreement is for letters of credit (trade and stand by) and working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including interest rates that are based on the agent banks "Alternate Base Rate," or a LIBO rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the Companys ratio (the "leverage ratio") of the sum of total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated EBITDAR for the trailing four fiscal quarter period. The facility fees are projected to accrue at .175% on the committed amounts per annum. The remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are similar to the Original Credit Agreement. Additional details regarding the Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 8). Letters of credit totaling approximately $49.6 million and $42.8 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement at January 29, 2005 or January 31, 2004. 38 The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that are set to expire during the fourth quarter of the 2005 fiscal year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of January 29, 2005, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Leases Obligations $ 1,256,107 $ 164,577 $ 323,255 $ 282,525 $ 485,750 Purchase Obligations 222,404 215,971 6,433 Other Obligations $ 65,167 $ 64,372 $ 795 Totals $ 1,543,678 $ 444,920 $ 330,483 $ 282,525 $ 485,750 The majority of the Companys contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for its stores (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The purchase obligations category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2005 and commitments for fabric to be used during the next several seasons. Other obligations represent preventive maintenance contracts for the 2005 fiscal year and letters of credit outstanding as of January 29, 2005 (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows: January 29, 2005 January 31, 2004 Number of Stores Abercrombie & Fitch 357 357 abercrombie 171 171 Hollister 256 172 RUEHL 4 Total 788 700 Gross square feet at period end (thousands) Abercrombie & Fitch 3,138 3,152 abercrombie 752 753 Hollister 1,663 1,111 RUEHL 37 Total 5,590 5,016 Average store size at period end (gross square feet) Abercrombie & Fitch 8,790 8,828 abercrombie 4,399 4,401 Hollister 6,495 6,461 RUEHL 9,350 Total 7,094 7,165 39 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LESSOR CONSTRUCTION ALLOWANCES Capital expenditures totaled $185.1 million, $159.8 million and $145.7 million for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively. Additionally, the non cash accrual for construction in progress decreased $15.5 million and $ 12.7 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2002, respectively, and increased $18.6 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures in the 2004 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction in addition to approximately $15.4 million invested in information technology, home office expansion and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in the 2003 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction with approximately $35.0 million invested in home office expansion, information technology, including a new point of sale system and distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in the 2002 fiscal year related primarily to new store construction with approximately $20.0 million invested in information technology and distribution center projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store leases. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $55.0 million, $60.6 million and $52.7 million in construction allowances during the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively. For accounting purposes, the Company treats construction allowances as a deferred lease credit which is amortized to reduce rent expense on a straight line basis over the life of the leases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.13, "Accounting for Leases" and Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 88 1, "Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases". The Company anticipates spending $240.0 million to $250.0 million in the 2005 fiscal year for capital expenditures, of which $205.0 million to $215.0 million is planned to be for the construction of approximately 87 new stores as well as the remodeling of 25 to 35 existing stores. The balance of the capital expenditures will primarily relate to a new home office building and other miscellaneous home office and distribution center projects. The Company intends to add approximately 520,000 gross square feet of stores in the 2005 fiscal year, which will represent a 9% increase over year end 2004. Management anticipates the increase during fiscal 2005 will be due to the net addition of approximately 67 new Hollister stores, 5 RUEHL stores and 5 international stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 25 to 35 Abercrombie & Fitch stores and convert a total of 9 Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie stores to 8 Hollister stores and one RUEHL store. In addition the Company plans to open a new 34,000 gross square foot flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 56th Street in Manhattan, New York and expand its store in The Grove in Los Angeles by approximately 14,000 gross square feet. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, excluding the above mentioned New York and Los Angeles flagship stores, opened during the 2005 fiscal year will approximate $618,000 per store, net of construction allowances. In addition, initial inventory purchases for the stores are expected to average approximately $270,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for new abercrombie stores opened during the 2005 fiscal year will approximate $581,000, net of construction allowances, per store. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $130,000 per store. The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for new Hollister stores opened during the 2005 fiscal year will approximate $613,000, net of construction allowances, per store. In addition, initial inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $190,000 per store. 40 Although the Company opened four RUEHL stores during the 2004 fiscal year, it believes that the costs it has incurred to date for the stores are not representative of the future average cost of opening a store. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue and the direct shipping costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. Revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. The Company reviews its gift card liability at least annually and adjusts the liability based on historical redemption patterns as required. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market, on a first in first out basis, utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At the Company, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit ("SKU") level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. 41 Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, the lesser of 10 years or the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortizations are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 123R ("SFAS 123R"), "Share Based Payment," a revision of FASB issued Statement No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS 123R requires an entity to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if the Company had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock based compensation awards. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is still in the process of determining the impact on the results of operations and financial position upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. 42 IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in marketable securities, which primarily consist of investment grade auction rate securities classified as available for sale. These securities are consistent with the investment objectives contained within the investment policy established by the Companys Board of Directors. The basic objectives are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements and maximizing net after tax yield. Despite the long term maturity of auction rate securities, from the investors perspective, such securities are priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates are reset at predetermined periods ranging from 7 to 49 days. Failed auctions occur rarely. As of January 29, 2005, the Company held no auction rate securities. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of January 29, 2005, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that an adverse change in interest rates would have a material affect on the Companys financial condition. 44
