ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company reclassified its condensed consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. In prior periods, the Company included buying and occupancy costs as well as certain home office expenses as part of the gross profit calculation. The Company believes that presenting gross profit as a function of sales reduced solely by cost of goods sold, as well as presenting stores and distribution expense and marketing, general and administrative expense as individual expense categories, provides a clearer and more transparent representation of gross selling margin and operating expenses. Prior period results have been reclassified accordingly. The Company had net sales of $2.785 billion in Fiscal 2005, up 37.8% from $2.021 billion in Fiscal 2004. Operating income for Fiscal 2005 increased 56.1% to $542.7 million from $347.6 million for Fiscal 2004. Operating income results in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 included the impact of non recurring charges of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and $40.9 million related to a legal settlement, respectively. Net income was $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005, up 54.3% from $216.4 million in Fiscal 2004. Net income per fully diluted weighted average share was $3.66 for Fiscal 2005 compared to $2.28 in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 60.5%. The non recurring charges, net of the related tax effect, reduced reported net income per fully diluted share by $0.09 and $0.27 in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. The Company generated cash from operations of $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005 versus $423.8 million in Fiscal 2004, resulting primarily from strong sales and income. During Fiscal 2005, the Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, opening 57 new Hollister stores, 15 new Abercrombie Fitch stores, five new abercrombie stores and four new RUEHL stores, as well as remodeling 14 Abercrombie Fitch stores. Further, the Company used excess cash to repurchase 1.8 million shares of common stock for $103.3 million and pay dividends of $0.60 per share for a total of $52.2 million. The Company believes that share repurchases and dividends are an important way for the Company to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys first priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility. 26 Table of Contents The following data represent the Companys consolidated statements of net income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2005 2004 2003 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Goods Sold 33.5 33.6 36.6 GROSS PROFIT 66.5 66.4 63.4 Stores and Distribution Expense 35.9 36.5 35.0 Marketing, General and Administrative Expense 11.3 (1) 12.9 (2) 9.1 Other Operating Income, Net (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) OPERATING INCOME 19.5 17.2 19.4 Interest Income, Net (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.2 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 19.7 17.5 19.6 Provision for Income Taxes 7.7 6.8 7.6 NET INCOME 12.0 % 10.7 % 12.0 % (1) Includes 0.5% related to a severance agreement.

Initially, the Company focused on its store base by completing the roll out across all brands of the store investment program that started in late Fiscal 2004. The Company added more sales floor coverage by increasing the brand representative hours at the stores, which the Company believes enhanced the customers in store experience and helped lower inventory shrink. Additionally, the Company implemented a new store merchandise filling system and organized the store stock rooms to improve merchandise replenishment efficiency. Finally, the Company invested in its home office organization by broadening the merchandising and design groups, providing the Company with greater expertise at the product category level across all brands, while creating leverage with its supplier base. Other home office investments included the creation and launch of the Abercrombie Fitch Brand Protection Team, the Companys new anti counterfeiting program, the development of its international support group, as well as investments in its design and technical design groups. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company opened the first Abercrombie Fitch flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York City. The store performed well throughout the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, exceeding managements initial sales productivity expectations. During January 2006, the Company also opened its first Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister stores in Canada. These stores are off to a strong start with productivity above that of their respective average U.S. counterparts. The Company plans to open additional flagship locations in Los Angeles during Fiscal 2006 and London in early 2007. The Company views the Hollister brand as a significant growth vehicle for the Company in the future, with the brand having reached only half of its maximum store potential; Abercrombie Fitch is a maturing brand with its opportunity for future growth and contribution depending on securing prime locations for its stores and expanding the brand and its presence outside of the United States; abercrombie is viewed as having growth opportunities within the United States; management continues to refine RUEHLs merchandise mix, marketing strategy and store presentation to position the brand for long term profitability. For Fiscal 2006, the Company will be faced with the challenge of improving on Fiscal 2005s successful business. The Company has begun to annualize the strong comparable store sales growth, which started in January 2005. While the Company believes it can sustain positive comparable store sales increases in Fiscal 2006, the increases are not expected to be at the level reported during Fiscal 2005. Management will operate the business as it always has it will protect and enhance the brands and work to ensure their long term success. While the Company has been able to improve its Initial Markup (IMU) in the past, management does not anticipate any IMU improvements in its forecasts or projections. The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 with inventories, at cost, up 59% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys investment in the jeans business and other basic categories. The Company will continue to invest in key inventory categories to drive business while actively managing its markdown exposure. The Company believes it will end the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 with a slightly lower increase in inventory per gross square foot, at cost, when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. 29 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2006, the Company will continue to focus on the customers in store experience. The Company expects that the on going management of the store investment program initiatives will be evaluated primarily by store sales performance, with consideration for customer service, shrink and other aspects of the customers in store experience. Additionally, the Company plans to continue to make capital expenditures to invest strategically in the appearance of its stores, primarily in Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister stores. These investments will allow the Company to update some of its older stores without having to do full remodels. The Company plans to make an investment during Fiscal 2006 in home office organizations and information technology infrastructure to enhance and increase efficiencies in its systems. The Company expects its payroll expense, excluding the impact of stock option expensing, to increase at a lower rate during Fiscal 2006 than it did during Fiscal 2005. Additionally, the Company also expects depreciation and amortization expense for the home office to increase during Fiscal 2006 as a result of the capital expenditures it incurred during Fiscal 2005, primarily the addition of a new office building. Historically the Company has reported stock based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, but elected to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense for options has been recognized as all options have been granted at fair market value at the grant date. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(Revised 2004) Share Based Payment, the Company will begin to recognize expense for stock options granted to the Companys associates and non associate directors beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, which will have an adverse impact on the Companys reported net income. Based on stock options previously issued, but not fully vested, and an estimate of stock options to be granted during Fiscal 2006, the Company expects that the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in a charge of approximately $0.10 per fully diluted share for Fiscal 2006. 30 Table of Contents The following measurements are among the key business indicators that management reviews regularly to gauge the Companys results: Comparable store sales, defined as year over year sales for a store that has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year, by brand, by product category and by store; IMU; Selling margin, defined as sales price less original cost, by brand and by product category; Store metrics such as sales per gross square foot, average unit retail, average transaction values, store contribution, defined as store sales less direct costs of running the store, and average units per transaction; Markdown rates; Gross profit; Operating income; Net income; and Cash flow and liquidity determined by Companys current ratio and cash provided by operations. While not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company, due in some cases to their proprietary nature, the Company does publicly disclose and discuss several of these metrics as part of its financial summary and in several sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $961.4 million, up 39.9% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $687.3 million. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 28% for the quarter and the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005 and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) of $8.1 million versus the comparable period in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18% with womens comparable store sales increasing by a low twenties percentage and mens increasing by a mid teen percentage. abercrombie, the kids business, achieved a 59% increase in comparable store sales with girls achieving a high sixties increase and boys posting a high thirties increase. In Hollister, comparable store sales increased by 34% for the fourth quarter with bettys increasing comparable store sales by a mid thirties percentage and dudes realizing an increase in the low thirties. 31 Table of Contents On a regional basis, comparable store sales increases for the Company ranged from the mid twenties to the low thirties across the United States. Stores located in the North Atlantic and Southwest had the best comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. In Abercrombie Fitch, the womens comparable store sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong performances in polos, fleece, outerwear and sweaters. The mens comparable store sales growth was driven by increases in polos, graphic tees, jeans and personal care, offset by decreases in woven shirts and accessories. In the kids business, the girls comparable store sales increased as a result of strong sales performances across the majority of the categories, led by polos, fleece, graphic tees and jeans. Boys comparable store sales increase was driven by the following categories: polos, jeans, graphic tees and fleece, offset by slight decreases in the woven shirt and activewear categories. In Hollister, bettys had strong comparable store sales increases in polos, fleece, sweaters and graphic tees. The increase in the dudes comparable store sales was the result of strong performance in polos, graphic tees, fleece and personal care categories for the quarter, offset by decreases in woven shirts and sweaters. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $47.5 million, an increase of 18.5% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $40.1 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005 and $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limit the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $639.4 million compared to $455.8 million in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate (gross profit divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 66.5%, up 20 basis points from last years fourth quarter rate of 66.3%. The increase in gross profit rate resulted largely from a higher IMU during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 and a reduction in shrink versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate. The improvement in IMU during the fourth quarter was a result of higher average unit retail pricing across all brands. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU margins. 32 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $293.5 million compared to $223.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The stores and distribution expense rate (stores and distribution expense divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 30.5% compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. Stores and distribution expense was as follows: Thirteen Weeks Ended January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 (in millions) % of net sales (in millions) % of net sales Store Payroll Expense $ 101.5 10.6 % $ 74.6 10.9 % Store Management Expense (1) 12.4 1.3 % 7.7 1.1 % Rent, Utilities and Other Landlord Expense 75.0 7.8 % 57.5 8.4 % Depreciation and Amortization 29.4 3.1 % 28.1 4.1 % Repairs and Maintenance Expense 8.5 0.9 % 8.3 1.2 % Other Store Expenses (2) 45.9 4.8 % 30.8 4.5 % Total Stores Expense $ 272.7 28.4 % $ 207.0 30.1 % Direct to Consumer Expense 13.1 1.4 % 10.6 1.5 % Distribution Center Expense 7.7 0.8 % 6.2 0.9 % Total Stores and Distribution Expense $ 293.5 30.5 % $ 223.8 32.6 % (1) Previously reported within Store Payroll Expense. (2) Includes packaging, supplies, credit card fees and other store support functions. The Companys total store expense, as a percent of net sales, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 decreased 170 basis points versus the comparable period during Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs due to significant comparable store sales increases partially offset by increases in store management and loss prevention programs during Fiscal 2005. The Company believes that the increases in store management and loss prevention programs were key in driving sales and reducing shrink levels during the quarter, which had a favorable impact on the Companys gross profit rate. The distribution center productivity level, measured in units processed per labor hour (UPH), was 20% lower in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and from a change in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the distribution center approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in lower productivity rate due to the increased inventory handling. Although the Company expects the UPH level to continue to decrease in the near term, it is building a second distribution center at the Companys New Albany campus to address capacity issues and support future store growth. The second distribution center, which is currently under construction, is expected to be fully functional in late Fiscal 2006. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $80.8 million compared to $66.1 million during the same period in Fiscal 2004. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate (marketing, general and administrative expense divided by net sales) was 8.4% compared to 9.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to the Companys ability to leverage home office payroll, a reduction in sample expenses and marketing expenses due to timing of photo shoots, offset by increases in outside services mostly due to legal costs. 33 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $2.3 million compared to $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease was related to the amount of the gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 increased to $267.5 million from $170.2 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.2%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 27.8% compared to 24.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. Interest Income and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $2.4 million in Fiscal 2005 compared to $1.3 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest income was due to higher rates on investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 when compared to the same period in Fiscal 2004. The Company continued to invest in investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 39.0% compared to 39.2% for the Fiscal 2004 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $164.6 million versus $104.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.8%. Net income per fully diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $1.80 versus $1.15 for the same period last year, an increase of 56.5%. FISCAL 2005 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2005 were $2.785 billion, an increase of 37.8% versus Fiscal 2004 net sales of $2.021 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to an increase in comparable stores sales of 26% for the year, the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005 and a $13.9 million increase in net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) for the direct to consumer business. For the fiscal year, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18%; abercrombie increased 54%; Hollister increased 29%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2005, women, girls and bettys represented over 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. abercrombie girls achieved a mid sixties increase, Hollister bettys achieved a low thirties increase and Abercrombie Fitch women had a high teens increase. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2005 were $122.5 million, an increase of 10.8% versus last years net sales of $110.6 million for the comparable period. Shipping and handling revenue was $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005 and $15.7 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.2% of net sales in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration during Fiscal 2005 was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives throughout the year that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limited the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. 34 Table of Contents Gross Profit For Fiscal 2005, gross profit increased to $1.851 billion from $1.341 billion in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2005 was 66.5% versus 66.4% the previous year. The gross profit rate increase of 10 basis points reflects higher initial markup and a reduction in shrink, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate than last year. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2005 was $1.001 billion compared to $738.2 million for Fiscal 2004. For Fiscal 2005, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.9% compared to 36.5% in the previous year. Stores and distribution expense was as follows: Fifty Two Weeks Ended January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 (in millions) % of net sales (in millions) % of net sales Store Payroll Expense $ 338.2 12.1 % $ 218.4 10.8 % Store Management Expense (1) 41.1 1.5 % 26.7 1.3 % Rent, Utilities and Other Landlord Expense 277.2 10.0 % 224.4 11.1 % Depreciation and Amortization 110.7 4.0 % 96.1 4.8 % Repairs and Maintenance Expense 43.1 1.5 % 34.7 1.7 % Other Store Expenses (2) 125.2 4.5 % 84.3 4.2 % Total Stores Expense $ 935.5 33.6 % $ 684.6 33.9 % Direct to Consumer Expense 38.5 1.4 % 33.1 1.6 % Distribution Center Expense 26.8 1.0 % 20.5 1.0 % Total Stores and Distribution Expense $ 1,000.8 35.9 % $ 738.2 36.5 % (1) Previously reported within Store Payroll Expense. (2) Includes packaging, supplies, credit card fees and other store support functions. The Companys total store expense, as a percent of net sales, during Fiscal 2005 decreased 30 basis points versus Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs, due to significant comparable store sales increases, partially offset by increased store payroll and store management expense. The distribution centers UPH rate for the year was 7% lower in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and from a change in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the distribution center approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in lower productivity rate due to the increased inventory handling. Although the Company expects the UPH level to continue to decrease in the near term, it is building a second distribution center at the Companys New Albany campus to address capacity issues and support future store growth. The second distribution center, which is currently under construction, is expected to be fully functional in late Fiscal 2006. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2005 was $313.5 million compared to $259.8 million in Fiscal 2004. For the current year, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3% compared to 12.9% in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to a non recurring charge of $40.9 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement and leverage in the home office payroll expense, offset by a non recurring charge of $13.5 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and legal costs. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $5.5 million compared to $4.5 million for Fiscal 2004. The increase in other operating income was related to the favorable settlement of a class action lawsuit related to credit card fees in which the Company was a class member and lease buyout payments from landlords, partially offset by a lower amount of gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Fiscal 2005 operating income was $542.7 million compared to $347.6 million for Fiscal 2004, an increase of 56.1%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2005 was 19.5% versus 17.2% in the previous year. Interest Income and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2005 was $6.7 million compared to $5.2 million for the previous year. The increase in net interest income was due to the Company receiving higher rates on its investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during Fiscal 2005 when compared to Fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2005 was 39.2% compared to 38.7% for Fiscal 2004. The increase in the annual effective tax rate was due to the Companys change of estimates in the potential outcomes and favorable settlements of certain state tax matters in Fiscal 2005. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2005 was $334.0 million versus $216.4 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 54.3%. Net income included after tax non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and $25.6 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement. Net income per fully diluted weighted average share was $3.66 in Fiscal 2005 versus $2.28 in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 60.5%. The percentage increase in net income per fully diluted shares outstanding was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the impact of the Companys share repurchase program. In Fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 FOURTH QUARTER 2004 Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 were $687.3 million, a 22.6% increase versus Fiscal 2003 fourth quarter net sales of $560.4 million. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 88 stores during Fiscal 2004, a comparable store sales increase of 9% for the quarter and an increase of $11.1 million in net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) for the direct to consumer business versus the comparable period in Fiscal 2003. By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 4% with mens comparable store sales increasing by a high single digit percentage and womens increasing by a low single digit percentage. abercrombie, the kids business, achieved a 16% increase in comparable store sales with girls attaining a high teen increase and boys increasing by a low double digit percentage. In Hollister, comparable store sales increased by 19% for the fourth quarter with bettys realizing an increase in the low twenties and dudes posting a high teens increase. 36 Table of Contents On a regional basis, comparable store sales results across all three brands were strongest in the Northeast and in the West and weakest in the Midwest. However, all regions reported positive comparable store sales for the quarter. The Company committed to a strategy that included fewer promotions in early Fiscal 2004, and maintained this strategy throughout the fiscal year. As such, the Company did not anniversary the direct mail promotions used during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 to drive business between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In Abercrombie Fitch, the mens comparable store sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong performances in graphic tees, jeans, and woven shirts. Womens comparable store sales growth was driven by an increase in polos, jeans and fleece, offset by a decrease in sweaters. In the abercrombie business, for the quarter, girls had comparable store sales increases across most of the categories, especially polos, jeans and graphic tees. Boys comparable store sales increases were driven by graphic tees, jeans and fleece. In Hollister, bettys achieved a slightly higher comparable store sales increase than dudes. In bettys, polos, jeans and fleece had strong comparable store sales increases. The increase in the dudes comparable store sales was the result of a strong performance in graphic tees, jeans and woven shirts categories for the quarter. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales through the Companys web sites and catalogue for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 were $40.1 million, an increase of 29.4% versus Fiscal 2003 fourth quarter net sales of $31.0 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004 and $3.5 million in Fiscal 2003. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 compared to 6.2% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. Gross Profit Gross profit for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was $455.8 million compared to $355.4 million in the corresponding period in Fiscal 2003. The gross profit rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was 66.3%, up 290 basis points from the Fiscal 2003 rate of 63.4%. The increase in gross profit rate resulted largely from lower markdowns and an increase in IMU during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, partially offset by the lower margin of RUEHL. The improvement in IMU during the fourth quarter was a result of higher average unit retail pricing in Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister. The three brands had IMU improvements compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 and operated at similar margins. The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 with inventories, at cost, up 11% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. The inventory increase reflected a planned acceleration of Spring and jeans merchandise deliveries. 37 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was $223.8 million compared to $164.0 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2003. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, the stores and distribution expense rate was 32.6% compared to 29.3% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. Stores and distribution expense was as follows: Thirteen Weeks Ended January 29, 2005 January 31, 2004 (in millions) % of net sales (in millions) % of net sales Store Payroll Expense $ 74.6 10.9 % $ 45.2 8.1 % Store Management Expense (1) 7.7 1.1 % 5.0 0.9 % Rent, Utilities and Other Landlord Expense 57.5 8.4 % 51.1 9.1 % Depreciation and Amortization 28.1 4.1 % 21.8 3.9 % Repairs and Maintenance Expense 8.3 1.2 % 5.1 0.9 % Other Store Expenses (2) 30.8 4.5 % 22.4 4.0 % Total Stores Expense $ 207.0 30.1 % $ 150.6 26.9 % Direct to Consumer Expense 10.6 1.5 % 8.3 1.5 % Distribution Center Expense 6.2 0.9 % 5.1 0.9 % Total Stores and Distribution Expense $ 223.8 32.6 % $ 164.0 29.3 % (1) Previously reported within Store Payroll Expense. (2) Includes packaging, supplies, credit card fees and other store support functions. The Companys total store expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, as a percent of net sales, increased versus the comparable period during Fiscal 2003 as a result of the Company beginning to implement its store investment program during this period, offset by leverage of rent, utilities and other landlord expense as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, the distribution centers UPH increased 10% over Fiscal 2003 fourth quarter results. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was $66.1 million compared to $37.1 million during the same period in Fiscal 2003. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 9.6% compared to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to higher home office payroll expense as a result of additional headcount in the home office, incentive compensation and legal expense. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter other operating income for Fiscal 2004 was $4.3 million compared to $459,000 for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. The increase was related to the amount of gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 increased to $170.2 million from $154.8 million in Fiscal 2003. The operating income rate was 24.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 compared to 27.6% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. 38 Table of Contents Interest Income and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income for Fiscal 2004 was $1.3 million compared with net interest income of $1.1 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest income was due to higher rates during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 when compared to the same period in Fiscal 2003. The Company continued to invest in tax free securities for the majority of the quarter and then changed its investing strategy to taxable money market investments. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39.2% compared to 39.3% for the Fiscal 2003 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was $104.3 million versus $94.6 million for the same period in Fiscal 2003, an increase of 10.3%. Net income per fully diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 was $1.15 versus $0.97 for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, an increase of 18.6%. The percentage increase in net income per fully diluted shares outstanding was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the Companys share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 the Company had fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 90.8 million versus 97.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. FISCAL 2004 Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2004 reached $2.021 billion, an increase of 18.3% versus Fiscal 2003 net sales of $1.708 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 88 stores during Fiscal 2004, an increase in comparable store sales of 2% for the year and an increase in the direct to consumer business net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) of $35.6 million versus Fiscal 2003. For the fiscal year, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch declined 1%; abercrombie increased 1%; Hollister increased 13%. The womens, girls and bettys businesses in each brand continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2004, women, bettys and girls represented over 60% of the net sales for each of the brands. Hollister bettys achieved a mid teens increase and abercrombie girls posted a mid single digit increase in comparable store sales for Fiscal 2004, while Abercrombie Fitch women had a low single digit decrease. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales through the Companys web sites and catalogue for Fiscal 2004 were $110.6 million, an increase of 37.6% versus net sales of $80.4 million in Fiscal 2003. The Company added a Hollister direct to consumer business during the 2003 Back to School selling season. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $15.7 million in Fiscal 2004 and $10.2 million in Fiscal 2003. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.2% of net sales compared to 5.3% for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2004, gross profit increased to $1.341 billion from $1.083 billion in Fiscal 2003. The gross profit rate in Fiscal 2004 was 66.4% versus 63.4% in Fiscal 2003. The increase was driven by improvements in IMU across Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister due to higher average unit retail pricing, especially in Abercrombie Fitch. 39 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2004 was $738.2 million compared to $597.4 million for Fiscal 2003. For Fiscal 2004, the stores and distribution expense rate was 36.5% compared to 35.0% in Fiscal 2003. Stores and distribution expense was as follows: Fifty Two Weeks Ended January 29, 2005 January 31, 2004 (in millions) % of net sales (in millions) % of net sales Store Payroll Expense $ 218.4 10.8 % $ 158.5 9.3 % Store Management Expense (1) 26.7 1.3 % 18.5 1.1 % Rent, Utilities and Other Landlord Expense 224.4 11.1 % 197.5 11.6 % Depreciation and Amortization 96.1 4.8 % 78.1 4.6 % Repairs and Maintenance Expense 34.7 1.7 % 25.6 1.5 % Other Store Expenses (2) 84.3 4.2 % 66.0 3.9 % Total Stores Expense $ 684.6 33.9 % $ 544.2 31.9 % Direct to Consumer Expense 33.1 1.6 % 34.8 2.0 % Distribution Center Expense 20.5 1.0 % 18.4 1.1 % Total Stores and Distribution Expense $ 738.2 36.5 % $ 597.4 35.0 % (1) Previously reported within Store Payroll Expense. (2) Includes packaging, supplies, credit card fees and other store support functions. The Companys total store expense for Fiscal 2004, as a percent of net sales, increased versus Fiscal 2003 as a result of the Company beginning to implement its store investment program during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, offset by leverage of rent, utilities and other landlord expense as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. In Fiscal 2004, the distribution centers UPH increased 10% over the Fiscal 2003 results. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2004 was $259.8 million compared to $155.6 million during Fiscal 2003. For Fiscal 2004, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 12.9% compared to 9.1% in Fiscal 2003. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to a non recurring charge of $40.9 million in Fiscal 2004, which represented 0.9% of net sales, related to a legal settlement and higher incentive compensation accruals resulting from the improved financial performance during the fiscal year. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2004 was $4.5 million compared to $979,000 for Fiscal 2003. The increase was related to the amount of the gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income For Fiscal 2004, operating income was $347.6 million compared to $331.2 million for Fiscal 2003. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2004 was 17.2% versus 19.4% in Fiscal 2003. 40 Table of Contents Interest Income and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2004 was $5.2 million compared to $3.7 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in interest rates and average cash balances for Fiscal 2004 when compared to Fiscal 2003. Beginning in January 2005, the Company began investing in taxable money market investments; prior thereto, the Company invested in tax free securities. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2004 was 38.7% compared to 38.8% for Fiscal 2003. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2004 was $216.4 million versus $204.8 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of 5.7%. Net income for Fiscal 2004 included the after tax impact of the legal settlement of $25.6 million. Net income per fully diluted weighted average diluted share was $2.28 in Fiscal 2004 versus $2.06 in Fiscal 2003, an increase of 10.7%. The percentage increase in net income per fully diluted share was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the Companys repurchase program in Fiscal 2004. The Company repurchased 11.2 million shares in Fiscal 2004. FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income resulted in higher cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company believes cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will continue to provide adequate resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.175 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors will review the Companys cash position and results of operations and approve the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization for the last three fiscal years follows (thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Working capital $ 455,530 $ 241,572 $ 466,970 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 995,117 $ 669,326 $ 857,765 The increase in working capital in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities resulting primarily from the Companys net sales increase and the increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable. The decrease in working capital in Fiscal 2004 versus Fiscal 2003 was the result of lower cash and marketable securities resulting primarily from the Companys repurchase of 11.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $434.7 million. 41 Table of Contents The Company considers the following to be measures of its liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: 2005 2004 2003 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.93 1.56 2.63 Net cash provided by operating activities (in thousand) $ 453,590 $ 423,784 $ 340,814 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary source of liquidity, increased to $453.6 million for Fiscal 2005 from $423.8 million in Fiscal 2004 primarily due to increases in net income, income taxes payable and tax benefit of stock option exercises, partially offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in net income and income taxes payable was a result of the net sales growth during Fiscal 2005. The increase in tax benefit of stock option exercises was the result of approximately 3.3 million stock options exercised during Fiscal 2005. The Company ended Fiscal 2005 with higher inventory levels in key product categories to ensure size, color and style integrity. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due to payment of a legal settlement in Fiscal 2005 that was settled and accrued for in Fiscal 2004. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the accrual for the settlement of three related class action employment discrimination lawsuits and the increase in accounts payable was due to the purchase of inventory. Inventories increased from the net addition of 103 stores representing an increase of 658,000 gross square feet in Fiscal 2003. Inventories at fiscal year end were 3% higher on a per gross square foot basis than at the end of the 2002 fiscal year. The Companys operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters as the Company builds inventory in anticipation of these selling periods. Investing Activities Cash outflows for Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2003 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Cash inflows for Fiscal 2004 were primarily the result of proceeds from sales of marketable securities, offset by capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures and Lessor Construction Allowances for additional information. As of January 28, 2006, the Company held $411.2 million of marketable securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days; as of January 29, 2005, all investments had original maturities of less than 90 days and accordingly were classified as cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2004, the Company held $464.7 million of marketable securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days. Financing Activities Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of the Companys Class A Common Stock in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 and the payment of dividends in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Cash inflows consisted of stock option exercises, restricted stock issuances and the change in overdrafts. The overdrafts are outstanding checks reclassified from cash to accounts payable. 42 Table of Contents The Company repurchased 1,765,000 shares, 11,150,500 shares and 4,401,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs in Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. As of January 28, 2006, the Company had 5,683,500 shares remaining available to repurchase under the 6,000,000 shares authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2005. Effective December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement will expire on December 15, 2009. The primary purpose of the Amended Credit Agreement is to support letters of credit (trade and standby) and finance working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including an option where interest rates are based on the agent banks Alternate Base Rate, and another using the LIBO rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the Companys leverage ratio of the sum of total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated EBITDAR for the trailing four fiscal quarter period. The facility fees are projected to accrue between 0.15% and 0.175% on the committed amounts per annum. Letters of credit totaling approximately $45.1 million and $49.6 million were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at January 28, 2006 or January 29, 2005. The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.5 million that are set to expire during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of January 28, 2006, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) Less than More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Operating Leases Obligations $ 1,417,827 $ 187,674 $ 365,992 $ 325,526 $ 538,635 Purchase Obligations $ 303,683 303,683 Other Obligations $ 49,739 48,185 1,554 Totals $ 1,771,249 $ 539,542 $ 367,546 $ 325,526 $ 538,635 Operating lease obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases (See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance (CAM), insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. Total expense related to CAM, insurance and taxes for Fiscal 2005 was $96.5 million. The purchase obligations category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2006 and commitments for fabric to be used during the next several seasons. Other obligations represent preventive maintenance contracts for Fiscal 2006 and letters of credit outstanding as of January 28, 2006 (See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. 43 Table of Contents STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Total October 30, 2005 354 163 297 6 820 New 6 2 17 2 27 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 1 4 5 Closed (1 ) (1 ) January 28, 2006 361 164 318 8 851 Gross Square Feet (thousands) October 30, 2005 3,077 713 1,941 58 5,789 New 76 8 112 11 207 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 4 30 34 Closed (5 ) (5 ) January 28, 2006 3,157 716 2,083 69 6,025 Average Store Size 8,745 4,366 6,550 8,625 7,080 Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Total October 31, 2004 363 174 224 3 764 New 5 4 32 1 42 Closed (11 ) (7 ) (18 ) January 29, 2005 357 171 256 4 788 Gross Square Feet (thousands) October 31, 2004 3,191 767 1,452 28 5,438 New 31 16 211 9 267 Closed (84 ) (31 ) (115 ) January 29, 2005 3,138 752 1,663 37 5,590 Average Store Size 8,790 4,398 6,496 9,250 7,094 44 Table of Contents Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the fifty two weeks ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Total January 30, 2005 357 171 256 4 788 New 15 5 57 4 81 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (1 ) (1 ) 6 4 Closed (10 )1 (11 ) (1 )1 (22 ) January 28, 2006 361 164 318 8 851 Gross Square Feet (thousands) January 30, 2005 3,138 752 1,663 37 5,590 New 146 20 389 32 587 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (46 ) (4 ) 38 (12 ) Closed (81 )1 (52 ) (7 )1 (140 ) January 28, 2006 3,157 716 2,083 69 6,025 Average Store Size 8,745 4,366 6,550 8,625 7,080 1 Includes one Abercrombie Fitch and one Hollister store temporarily closed due to hurricane damage.

In Fiscal 2005, $204.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $51.7 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office expansion, information technology investments, distribution center improvements and other projects. In Fiscal 2004, $169.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $15.4 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, distribution center improvements and other projects. In Fiscal 2003, $124.8 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels and other projects. The remaining $35.0 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, distribution center improvements and other projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store leases. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $42.3 million, $55.0 million and $60.6 million in construction allowances during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. For accounting purposes, the Company treats construction allowances as a deferred lease credit which is amortized to reduce rent expense on a straight line basis over the life of the leases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.13, Accounting for Leases and Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 88 1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases. The Company anticipates spending $400 million to $420 million in Fiscal 2006 for capital expenditures, including $205 million to $210 million for the construction of approximately 100 to 110 new stores and the remodeling of 10 to 20 existing stores; $100 million to $105 million to build a second distribution center and an additional building on the home office campus; $40 million to $45 million for upgrades to its information technology infrastructure and other home office and distribution center projects; and $55 million to $60 million for various store projects that the Company believes are necessary to enhance the customers in store experience, which is the centerpiece of the Companys marketing strategy. The Company believes periodic investments in the in store experience are necessary to maintain the long term positioning of the brands. The Company intends to add approximately 700,000 to 750,000 gross square feet of stores during Fiscal 2006, which will represent an increase of approximately 10% to 12% over Fiscal 2005. Management anticipates the increase during Fiscal 2006 will be primarily due to the addition of approximately 60 to 70 new Hollister stores, 15 to 20 abercrombie stores, five to ten Abercrombie Fitch stores and five to eight RUEHL stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel five to 15 Abercrombie Fitch stores, including the opening of the flagship store in the Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles in the summer of 2006 and to convert a total of four Abercrombie Fitch stores to Hollister stores. 46 Table of Contents In Fiscal 2006, the Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new Hollister stores to increase from last years actual of approximately $114 to approximately $130. The Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new abercrombie stores to increase from last years actual of approximately $154 to approximately $169. The change from last years estimates for Hollister and abercrombie were driven by a number of factors, including store location, construction material pricing, landlord allowance levels, and furniture and fixture additions. In addition, varying allowance levels for the small number of abercrombie stores added in Fiscal 2005 prevent a meaningful comparison with Fiscal 2006 expected costs. Due to variances in landlord allowances and other characteristics unique to the three new Abercrombie Fitch locations currently identified for Fiscal 2006, the construction costs, net of construction allowances, of these stores are also higher than last years actual per store costs. The Company believes that the construction costs of the three identified Abercrombie Fitch stores are not representative of the costs the Company expects to incur for the remaining Abercrombie Fitch stores planned in Fiscal 2006. The Company expects initial inventory purchases for the stores to average approximately $371,000, $148,000 and $243,000 per store for Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister, respectively. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Amended Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping costs are classified as stores and distribution expense. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Companys gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. The liability remains on the Companys books until the earlier of redemption (recognized as revenue) or when the Company determines the likelihood of redemption is remote (recognized as other operating income). The Company considers the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote for 50% of the balance of gift cards at 24 months after the date of issuance and remote for the remaining balance at 36 months after the date of issuance and at that time recognizes the remaining balance as other operating income. At January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, the gift card liability on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet was $53.2 million and $41.7 million, respectively. The Company is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the states in which it operates. During Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, the Company recognized other operating income for adjustments to the gift card liability of $2.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively. No income for adjustments to the gift card liability was recognized during Fiscal 2003. 47 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method. The retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory. At the Company, the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. At the end of the first and third fiscal quarters, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, IMU, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, the lesser of 10 years or the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for other property and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortizations are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent results of operations and projected cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. Equity Compensation Expense The Company reports stock based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, but elects to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 48 Table of Contents Accordingly, no compensation expense for options has been recognized because all options are granted at fair market value on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards to associates and non associate directors. For the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 123, the Companys equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants, which requires the Company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the term. The Company uses the vesting period of the stock option as a proxy for the term of the option. Estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the Companys stock for the period equal to the expected term of the stock option. The Company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for dividends and stock splits. The fair market value calculation under the Black Scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the term and volatility assumptions. Increases in term or volatility will result in a higher fair market valuation of stock option grants. Assuming all other assumptions disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, being equal, a 10% increase in term will yield a 4% increase in the Black Scholes valuation, while a 10% increase in volatility will yield a 8% increase in the Black Scholes valuation. The Company believes that changes in term and volatility will not have a material effect on the Companys results since the number of stock options granted during the period was not material. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R). This standard is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and similar awards, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values measured at the grant date. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) to annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 for public companies. Based on stock options previously issued, but not fully vested, and stock options to be granted during Fiscal 2006, the Company expects that the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in a charge of approximately $0.10 per fully diluted share for Fiscal 2006. Effective January 28, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47,) Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143,Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have any effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial position. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companys results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in marketable securities, which consist primarily of investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities, all classified as available for sale and could have maturities ranging from three months to forty years. These securities are consistent with the investment objectives contained within the investment policy established by the Companys Board of Directors. The basic objectives of the investment policy are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements and maximizing net after tax yield. Investments in municipal notes and bonds have early redemption provisions at predetermined prices. Taking these provisions into account none of these investments extend beyond five years. The Company believes that a significant increase in interest rates could result in a material loss if the Company sells the investment prior to the early redemption provision. For Fiscal 2005, there were no realized gains or losses, and as of January 28, 2006, net unrealized holding losses were $718,000. Despite the underlying long term maturity of auction rate securities, from the investors perspective, such securities are priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates are reset through an auction process at predetermined periods ranging from one to 49 days. Failed auctions rarely occur. As of January 28, 2006, the Company held approximately $411.2 million in marketable securities. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of January 28, 2006, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Companys market risk profile as of January 28, 2006 has not significantly changed since January 29, 2005. 50 Table of Contents
