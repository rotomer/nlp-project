ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31, typically resulting in a fifty two week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a fifty three week year. Fiscal 2006 includes fifty three weeks and Fiscal 2005 includes fifty two weeks. For purposes of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 are compared to the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended January 28, 2006. Comparable store sales however, compare the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 4, 2006. The Company had net sales of $3.318 billion for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007, up 19.1% from $2.785 billion for the fifty two weeks ended January 28, 2006. Operating income for Fiscal 2006 increased 21.3% to $658.1 million from $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005. Operating income results for Fiscal 2006 included $14.1 million of expense related to SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). Operating income results for Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. Net income was $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006, up 26.4% from $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 for Fiscal 2006 compared to $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. The Company generated cash from operations of $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006 versus $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from strong sales and income growth. During Fiscal 2006, the Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, opening 70 new Hollister stores, 19 new abercrombie stores, eight new Abercrombie Fitch stores and seven new RUEHL stores, remodeling 13 Abercrombie Fitch stores, as well as refreshing existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The Company also used excess cash in Fiscal 2006 to pay dividends of $0.70 per share, a 16.7% increase over $0.60 per share in Fiscal 2005, for a total of $61.6 million. The Company believes that share repurchases and dividends are an important way for the Company to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility. 27 Table of Contents The following data represents the Companys consolidated statements of net income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2006* 2005 2004 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Goods Sold 33.4 33.5 33.6 GROSS PROFIT 66.6 66.5 66.4 Stores and Distribution Expense 35.8 35.9 36.5 Marketing, General and Administrative Expense 11.3 11.3 12.9 Other Operating Income, Net (0.3 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) OPERATING INCOME 19.8 19.5 17.2 Interest Income, Net (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 20.3 19.7 17.5 Provision for Income Taxes 7.5 7.7 6.8 NET INCOME 12.7 % 12.0 % 10.7 % * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. 28 Table of Contents FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial and operational data compares Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004: Change 2006 * 2005 2004 2006 2005 2005 2004 Net sales by brand (thousands) $ 3,318,158 $ 2,784,711 $ 2,021,253 19 % 38 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 1,515,123 $ 1,424,013 $ 1,210,222 6 % 18 % abercrombie $ 405,820 $ 344,938 $ 227,204 18 % 52 % Hollister $ 1,363,233 $ 999,212 $ 579,687 36 % 72 % RUEHL** $ 33,982 $ 16,548 $ 4,140 105 % nm Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales*** 2% 26% 2% Abercrombie Fitch (4)% 18% (1)% abercrombie 10% 54% 1% Hollister 5% 29% 13% RUEHL** 14% n/a n/a Net retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, web sites and catalogue 17% 12% 16% Net retail sales per average store (thousands) $ 3,533 $ 3,284 $ 2,569 8 % 28 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 3,945 $ 3,784 $ 3,103 4 % 22 % abercrombie $ 2,251 $ 1,957 $ 1,241 15 % 58 % Hollister $ 3,732 $ 3,442 $ 2,740 8 % 26 % RUEHL** $ 3,248 $ 2,903 $ 1,255 12 % nm Net retail sales per average gross square foot $ 500 $ 464 $ 360 8 % 29 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 450 $ 432 $ 352 4 % 23 % abercrombie $ 513 $ 446 $ 282 15 % 58 % Hollister $ 568 $ 528 $ 423 8 % 25 % RUEHL** $ 363 $ 315 $ 136 15 % nm Transactions per average retail store 55,142 50,863 43,260 8 % 18 % Abercrombie Fitch 51,704 49,685 45,941 4 % 8 % abercrombie 34,786 30,356 21,740 15 % 40 % Hollister 68,740 64,913 56,687 6 % 15 % RUEHL** 38,554 26,215 12,913 47 % nm Average retail transaction value $ 64.07 $ 64.56 $ 59.38 (1 )% 9 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 76.30 $ 76.16 $ 67.54 nm 13 % abercrombie $ 64.72 $ 64.47 $ 57.10 nm 13 % Hollister $ 54.30 $ 53.03 $ 48.33 2 % 10 % RUEHL** $ 84.24 $ 110.74 $ 97.16 (24 )% 14 % Average units per retail transaction 2.35 2.25 2.26 4 % nm Abercrombie Fitch 2.26 2.18 2.22 4 % (2 )% abercrombie 2.78 2.66 2.68 5 % (1 )% Hollister 2.32 2.21 2.18 5 % 1 % RUEHL** 2.57 2.28 2.17 13 % 5 % Average unit retail sold $ 27.26 $ 28.69 $ 26.27 (5 )% 9 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 33.76 $ 34.94 $ 30.42 (3 )% 15 % abercrombie $ 23.28 $ 24.24 $ 21.31 (4 )% 14 % Hollister $ 23.41 $ 24.00 $ 22.17 (2 )% 8 % RUEHL** $ 32.78 $ 48.57 $ 44.77 (33 )% 8 % * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. ** Net sales for RUEHL during Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, and the related statistics, reflect the activity of 14 stores open in Fiscal 2006, eight stores open in Fiscal 2005, and four stores open in Fiscal 2004. As a result, year to year comparisons may not be meaningful. *** A store is included in comparable store sales when it has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year. Note Fiscal 2006 comparable store sales are compared to the comparable store sales for the fifty three weeks ended February 4, 2006. 29 Table of Contents CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK In Fiscal 2006, the Company continued to grow the business. Despite performance that was very challenging to build on in Fiscal 2005, the Company achieved a 2% increase in comparable store sales and a 19.1% increase in net sales in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales was driven by a combination of new store growth, an increase in the direct to consumer business, increases in transactions per store and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. Overall, the Company was able to make significant investments in future growth while improving operating income, as a percentage of sales, to 19.8%. These investments are summarized below. The first major area of investment was strengthening the iconic nature of the Companys brands. During Fiscal 2006, the Company eliminated distinct seasonal sales events to ensure that full price merchandise was available at stores during the transition from one season to the next. In addition, the Company refreshed select Abercrombie Fitch stores with the objective of replicating certain aspects of the Fifth Avenue Flagship store experience. Finally, the Company increased salary levels in several store manager categories in an effort to continue attracting and retaining strong management teams. The second major area of investment was international growth. During Fiscal 2006 the Company expanded its Canadian operations from two stores to six. The Canadian stores generated approximately three times the sales per square foot of an average U.S. store. As a result of the success of the Canadian stores, the Company is exploring the opportunity of expanding the abercrombie brand into Canada in Fiscal 2007. During Fiscal 2006 the Company also invested its resources and focus on building and staffing its U.K. London flagship Abercrombie Fitch store. The store opened on March 22, 2007 and the initial results exceeded the Companys expectations. The third major area of investment was infrastructure to support the future growth of the Company. In Fiscal 2006, the Company opened its second DC which increased the Companys capacity to support stores by approximately 800 stores. In addition, the Company continued to invest in staffing on both the creative and administrative sides of the business in order to offset the effect of underinvestment in prior years. For Fiscal 2007, the Company does not anticipate additions to headcount at the same rate as in Fiscal 2006. The Company also opened an on campus merchandise research and development center known as the Innovation Design Center (IDC). The IDC produces graphic and wash samples for quick approval, and the final designs are packaged for vendor production. The IDC enables the Company to reduce the time to market for the latest fashion trends, saving time and expense while limiting the competitions ability to copy its designs. The fourth major area of investment was information technology. The Company invested in the upgrade of core systems to help run allocation, planning, sourcing and merchandising. The system upgrades are expected to make the Company more scalable, efficient and accurate in the production and delivery of merchandise to stores. The Company also continues to invest in best practice technologies that are expected to provide a clear competitive advantage. 30 Table of Contents The Company views the Hollister brand as having a growing iconic status and as a significant growth vehicle in the future. Hollisters success in Canada and the growth in international web sales have resulted in the Company investigating the acceleration of its international store rollout. Abercrombie Fitch is a maturing brand with an opportunity for future growth dependent on prime locations for its stores along with brand expansion outside of the United States. The Company is pursuing real estate in both Tokyo and key European markets for the next phase of international expansion for Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister stores. abercrombie is viewed as having growth opportunities within the United States, and the Company expects to grow the brand to about 250 locations, as well as possible expansion into Canada. RUEHL performed well in Fiscal 2006 with strong trends in many areas. Transactions per store increased and the brand achieved a 14% increase in comparable store sales, which the Company believes indicates RUEHL is building a strong customer base. The Company is targeting RUEHL Initial Markup (IMU) parity with the other brands as well as profitability by the end of Fiscal 2007. Additionally, the Company plans to introduce its next concept with the opening of approximately three stores in January 2008 and approximately four additional stores by March 2008. For Fiscal 2007, the Company will be faced with the challenge of improving on Fiscal 2006s performance. From a gross margin standpoint, while the Company has been able to improve its IMU in the past, the Company does not anticipate IMU improvements in its forecasts. The Company expects to leverage marketing, general and administrative expense in Fiscal 2007. However, with additional expenses such as store minimum wage increases, store manager payroll increases, new concept pre opening costs and incremental costs of operating the second DC, the Company does not anticipate leveraging stores and distribution expense on a flat to slightly positive comparable store sales increase in Fiscal 2007. The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 with inventories, at cost, up 6% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The Company believes it will end the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 with inventory flat to slightly positive on a per gross square foot, at cost, when compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2006. During Fiscal 2007, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between $395 million and $405 million. Approximately $220 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels. Approximately $60 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refresh will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, the store refresh will include the addition of video walls at existing Hollister stores and fixtures to stores throughout the Hollister chain. The Company is planning approximately $85 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to new office buildings, information technology investment and new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems. In March 2007, the Company decided to allocate approximately $35 million for the purchase of an airplane. With planned expansion in Europe and Asia over the next several years, the Company concluded that acquiring a plane is more beneficial than continuing multiple fractional share ownership programs in meeting the business travel needs of its Chief Executive Officer and senior management team. 31 Table of Contents The following measurements are among the key business indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Companys results: Comparable store sales by brand, by product and by store, defined as year over year sales for a store that has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year; IMU; Selling margin, defined as sales price less original cost, by brand and by product category; Store metrics such as sales per gross square foot, average unit retail, average transaction values, store contribution (defined as store sales less direct costs of running the store), and average units per transaction; Markdown rate; Gross profit rate; Operating income; Net income; Inventory per gross square foot; and Cash flow and liquidity determined by the Companys current ratio and cash provided by operations. While not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company, due to the proprietary nature of the information, the Company publicly discloses and discusses several of these metrics as part of its financial summary and in several sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $1.139 billion, up 18.5% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $961.4 million. The net sales increase was primarily attributed to the net addition of 93 stores, including the full quarter impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue Flagship store and six stores in Canada; a 58% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fourteen week quarter in Fiscal 2006 versus a thirteen week quarter in Fiscal 2005, partially offset by a 3% decrease in comparable store sales. 32 Table of Contents Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the same quarter in Fiscal 2005 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 6% with womens comparable store sales decreasing by a high single digit and mens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie increased 2% with boys achieving a mid single digit increase and girls flat; Hollister was flat with bettys flat and dudes posting a decrease in the low single digits; and RUEHL increased 6% with womens realizing a mid single digit increase and mens posting a low single digit increase. On a regional basis, comparable store sales for the Company ranged from decreases in the high single digits to increases in the low single digits. Stores located in the New York and Mid Atlantic regions had the strongest comparable store sales performance and stores located in the West region had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included fleece, knit tops and underwear, while jeans, pants and sweaters posted negative comparable store sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included knit tops, fleece and shorts, while jeans, skirts and pants posted negative comparable store sales. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $74.8 million, an increase of 57.5% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $47.5 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006 and $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 7.4% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $755.6 million compared to $639.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate (gross profit divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 66.4%, down 10 basis points from last years fourth quarter rate of 66.5%. The decrease in gross profit rate largely resulted from higher shrink and a slightly higher markdown rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU levels. The Company is targeting RUEHL IMU parity with the other brands by the end of Fiscal 2007. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $349.8 million compared to $293.5 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The stores and distribution expense rate (stores and distribution expense divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 30.7% up 20 basis points from 30.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in rate is primarily related to additional DC expenses associated with the second DC, which became fully operational in the fourth quarter, and direct to consumer expenses, which increased due to higher internet sales as a percentage of total sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased store expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling payroll, driven by management salary increases, state minimum wage increases and additional floor coverage to address shrink concerns increased as a percentage of sales. However, the increase in selling payroll was more than offset by leveraging other store related controllable expenses. 33 Table of Contents The DC productivity level, measured in units processed per labor hour (UPH), was 9% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The UPH rate increase was due to the second DC becoming fully operational during the fourth quarter. The Company expects the UPH level to increase during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $101.6 million compared to $80.8 million during the same period in Fiscal 2005. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate (marketing, general and administrative expense divided by net sales) was 8.9% compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to higher home office payroll and consulting expenses. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $4.6 million compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Other operating income primarily related to the gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 increased to $308.8 million from $267.5 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 15.4%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 27.1% compared to 27.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $4.7 million in Fiscal 2006 compared to $2.4 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 36.8% as compared to 39.0% for the Fiscal 2005 comparable period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to favorable settlements of tax audits during the fourth quarter and the change in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $198.2 million versus $164.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 20.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $2.14, including $0.01 related to SFAS 123(R), versus $1.80 for the same period last year, an increase of 18.9%. 34 Table of Contents FISCAL 2006 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2006 were $3.318 billion, an increase of 19.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net sales of $2.785 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 93 stores, including the full year impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue Flagship store and six stores in Canada; a 2% comparable store sales increase; a 42% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 4%; abercrombie increased 10%; Hollister increased 5%; and RUEHL increased 14%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2006, women, girls and bettys represented over 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. Comparable store sales by brand for the year for womens, girls and bettys were as follows: RUEHL women increased by the high fifties; Hollister bettys posted a mid twenties increase; abercrombie girls had a mid teens increase; and Abercrombie Fitch women had a low single digit increase. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2006 were $174.1 million, an increase of 42.1% versus last years net sales of $122.5 million for the comparable period. Shipping and handling revenue was $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006 and $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2006, gross profit increased to $2.209 billion from $1.851 billion in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2006 was 66.6% versus 66.5% the previous year, an increase of 10 basis points. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2006 was $1.187 billion compared to $1.001 billion for Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.8% compared to 35.9% in the previous year. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from the Companys ability to leverage store related costs on a 2% increase in comparable store sales. The DCs UPH rate for the year was flat in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2006, while the second DC was being built, the overall DCs UPH was impacted by the Companys first DC reaching near capacity, a result of the Companys focus on strategically flowing inventory to stores throughout the year. The Company expects the UPH level to increase during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2006 was $373.8 million compared to $313.5 million in Fiscal 2005. For the current year, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3%, flat compared to Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included a charge of $13.6 million related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $10.0 million compared to $5.5 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote and insurance reimbursements received during the first and second quarters for Fiscal 2006 related to stores damaged by fire and Hurricane Katrina, respectively. Operating Income Fiscal 2006 operating income was $658.1 million compared to $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 21.3%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2006 was 19.8% versus 19.5% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2006 was $13.9 million compared to $6.7 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2006 was 37.2% compared to 39.2% for Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate related primarily to favorable settlements of tax audits, favorable changes in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters and an increase in tax exempt income during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 tax expense reflected a charge related to the Companys change in estimate of the potential outcome of certain state tax matters. The Company estimates that the annual effective tax rate for Fiscal 2007 will be approximately 39%. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2006 was $422.2 million versus $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 26.4%. Net income included after tax charges of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2006 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 in Fiscal 2006 versus $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $961.4 million, up 39.9% versus net sales of $687.3 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 28% for the quarter, the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005, and an increase in direct to consumer business net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) of $8.1 million versus the comparable period in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. 36 Table of Contents By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18% with womens comparable store sales increasing by a low twenties percentage and mens increasing by a mid teen percentage; abercrombie achieved a 59% increase in comparable store sales with girls achieving a high sixties increase and boys posting a high thirties increase; and Hollister increased by 34% for the fourth quarter with bettys increasing comparable store sales by a mid thirties percentage and dudes realizing an increase in the low thirties. In RUEHL, there were eight stores open in Fiscal 2005 and four stores open in Fiscal 2004. As a result comparable store sales results were not meaningful. On a regional basis, comparable store sales increases for the Company ranged from the mid twenties to the low thirties across the United States. Stores located in the North Atlantic and Southwest had the best comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. In Abercrombie Fitch, the womens comparable store sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong performances in polos, fleece, outerwear and sweaters. The mens comparable store sales growth was driven by increases in polos, graphic tees, jeans and personal care, offset by decreases in woven shirts and accessories. In the kids business, the girls comparable store sales increased as a result of strong sales performances across the majority of the categories, led by polos, fleece, graphic tees and jeans. Boys comparable store sales increase was driven by the following categories: polos, jeans, graphic tees and fleece, offset by slight decreases in the woven shirt and activewear categories. In Hollister, bettys had strong comparable store sales increases in polos, fleece, sweaters and graphic tees. The increase in dudes comparable store sales was the result of strong performance in polos, graphic tees, fleece and personal care categories for the quarter, offset by decreases in woven shirts and sweaters. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $47.5 million, an increase of 18.5% versus net sales of $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005 and $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limited the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $639.4 million compared to $455.8 million in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 66.5%, up 20 basis points from a rate of 66.3% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The increase in gross profit rate resulted largely from a higher IMU during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 and a reduction in shrink versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate. The improvement in IMU during the fourth quarter was a result of higher average unit retail pricing across all brands. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU margins. 37 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $293.5 million compared to $223.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The stores and distribution expense rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 30.5% compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The Companys total store and distribution expense, as a percent of net sales, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 decreased 210 basis points versus the comparable period during Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs due to significant comparable store sales increases partially offset by increases in store management and loss prevention programs during Fiscal 2005. The leveraging of fixed costs included store payroll expense, rent, utilities and other landlord expense, depreciation and amortization and repairs and maintenance expense. The Company believes increases in store management and loss prevention programs were key in driving sales and reducing shrink levels during the quarter, which had a favorable impact on the Companys gross profit rate. The DC productivity level, measured in UPH, was 20% lower in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and from a change in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the DC approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in a lower productivity rate due to an increased handling of inventory. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $80.8 million compared to $66.1 million during the same period in Fiscal 2004. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 8.4% compared to 9.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to the Companys ability to leverage home office payroll, and a reduction in sample expenses and marketing expenses due to timing of photo shoots, offset by increases in outside services mostly due to legal costs. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $2.3 million compared to $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 increased to $267.5 million from $170.2 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.2%. The operating income rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 27.8% compared to 24.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. 38 Table of Contents Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $2.4 million in Fiscal 2005 compared to $1.3 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest income was due to higher rates on investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 when compared to the same period in Fiscal 2004. The Company continued to invest in investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 39.0% compared to 39.2% for the Fiscal 2004 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $164.6 million versus $104.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.8%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $1.80 versus $1.15 for the comparable period in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 56.5%. FISCAL 2005 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2005 were $2.785 billion, an increase of 37.8% versus Fiscal 2004 net sales of $2.021 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to an increase in comparable store sales of 26% for the year, the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005, and a $13.9 million increase in net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) for the direct to consumer business. For the fiscal year, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18%; abercrombie increased 54%; Hollister increased 29%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2005, women, girls and bettys represented over 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. abercrombie girls achieved a mid sixties increase, Hollister bettys achieved a low thirties increase and Abercrombie Fitch women had a high teens increase. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2005 were $122.5 million, an increase of 10.8% versus Fiscal 2004 net sales of $110.6 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005 and $15.7 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.2% of net sales in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration during Fiscal 2005 was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives throughout the year that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limited the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2005, gross profit increased to $1.851 billion from $1.341 billion in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2005 was 66.5% versus 66.4% the previous year. The gross profit rate increase of 10 basis points reflects higher initial markup and a reduction in shrink, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate in Fiscal 2004. 39 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2005 was $1.001 billion compared to $738.2 million for Fiscal 2004. For Fiscal 2005, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.9% compared to 36.5% in the previous year. The Companys total store and distribution expense, as a percent of net sales, during Fiscal 2005 decreased 60 basis points versus Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs, due to significant comparable store sales increases, partially offset by increased store payroll and store management expense. The leveraging of fixed costs included rent, utilities and other landlord expenses, depreciation and amortization and repairs and maintenance expense. The DCs UPH rate for the year was 7% lower in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and changes in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the DC approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in a lower productivity rate due to increased inventory handling. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2005 was $313.5 million compared to $259.8 million in Fiscal 2004. For Fiscal 2005, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3% compared to 12.9% in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to a non recurring charge of $40.9 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement and leverage in the home office payroll expense, offset by a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and legal costs. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $5.5 million compared to $4.5 million for Fiscal 2004. The increase in other operating income was related to the favorable settlement of a class action lawsuit related to credit card fees in which the Company was a class member and lease buyout payments from landlords, partially offset by a lower amount of gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Fiscal 2005 operating income was $542.7 million compared to $347.6 million for Fiscal 2004, an increase of 56.1%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2005 was 19.5% versus 17.2% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2005 was $6.7 million compared to $5.2 million for the previous year. The increase in net interest income was due to the Company receiving higher rates on its investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during Fiscal 2005 when compared to Fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2005 was 39.2% compared to 38.7% for Fiscal 2004. The increase in the annual effective tax rate was due to the Companys change of estimates in the potential outcomes of certain state tax matters in Fiscal 2005. 40 Table of Contents Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2005 was $334.0 million versus $216.4 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 54.3%. Net income included after tax non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and $25.6 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $3.66 in Fiscal 2005 versus $2.28 in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 60.5%. The percentage increase in net income per diluted share outstanding was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the impact of the Companys share repurchase program. In Fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares. FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income resulted in higher cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company believes cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will continue to provide adequate resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.175 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors will review the Companys cash position and results of operations and address the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization for the last three fiscal years follows (thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Working capital $ 581,451 $ 455,530 $ 241,572 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 1,405,297 $ 995,117 $ 669,326 The increase in working capital during Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys net income increase and decreases in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses. The increase in working capital in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys net sales increase, and the increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable. The Company considers the following to be measures of its liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.14 1.93 1.56 Net cash provided by operating activities(thousands) $ 582,171 * $ 453,590 $ 423,784 * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. 41 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary source of liquidity, increased to $582.2 million for Fiscal 2006 from $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash in Fiscal 2006 was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and lessor construction allowances collected. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and payment of income taxes. Cash in Fiscal 2005 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges, lessor construction allowances collected and decreases in payments of income taxes. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of increases in inventory. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $453.6 million for Fiscal 2005 from $423.8 million in Fiscal 2004. Cash in Fiscal 2004 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and lessor construction allowances collected and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and other assets and liabilities. The Companys operations are seasonal and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters as the Company builds inventory in anticipation of these selling periods. Investing Activities Cash outflows for Fiscal 2006 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities, the purchase of trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures. As of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the Company held $466.1 million and $411.2 million, respectively, of available for sale securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days .. Of the $466.1 million of available for sale securities held as of February 3, 2007, $447.8 million were classified as marketable securities while $18.3 million were held in an irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust) and were classified as other assets. Cash outflows for Fiscal 2005 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures. As January 28, 2006, the Company held $411.2 million of available for sale securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days classified as marketable securities. Cash inflows for Fiscal 2004 were primarily the result of proceeds from sales of marketable securities, offset by capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures and Lessor Construction Allowances for additional information. As of January 29, 2005, all investments had maturities of less than 90 days and accordingly were classified as cash equivalents. Financing Activities Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the payment of dividends and a change in outstanding checks in Fiscal 2006. Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of the Companys Class A Common Stock and the payment of dividends in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Cash inflows consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. The Company did not repurchase shares in Fiscal 2006. The Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares and approximately 11.2 million shares of its Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had approximately 5.7 million shares available to repurchase under the 6.0 million shares authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2005. 42 Table of Contents On December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). The primary purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement are for trade and stand by letters of credit and working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including an option where interest rates are based on the agent banks Alternate Base Rate, and another using the London Interbank Offered Rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the ratio of the Companys leveraged total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for the trailing four fiscal quarter periods. The facility fees are projected to accrue at either 0.15% or 0.175% on the committed amounts per annum. The Amended Credit Agreement contains limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale leaseback transactions, significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions with third parties, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and stock repurchases) and transactions with affiliates. The Amended Credit Agreement will mature on December 15, 2009. Trade letters of credit totaling approximately $48.8 million and $40.6 million were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 3, 2007 or on January 28, 2006. Standby letters of credit totaling approximately $4.9 million and $4.5 million were outstanding on February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. The standby letters of credit are set to expire primarily during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of February 3, 2007, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Lease Obligations $ 1,671,681 $ 215,499 $ 422,500 $ 373,454 $ 660,228 Purchase Obligations 216,899 216,899 Other Obligations 77,332 66,449 10,883 Totals $ 1,965,912 $ 498,847 $ 433,383 $ 373,454 $ 660,228 Operating lease obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance (CAM), insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. Total expense related to CAM, insurance and taxes was $107.4 million in Fiscal 2006. The purchase obligations category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2007 and commitments for fabric to be used during the next season. Other obligations primarily represent preventive maintenance contracts for Fiscal 2007 and letters of credit outstanding as of February 3, 2007 (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. 43 Table of Contents STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2006, respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Total October 28, 2006 358 171 372 11 912 New 3 8 21 4 36 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 1 (1 )(1) Closed (2 ) (2 ) (4 ) February 3, 2007 360 177 393 14 944 Gross Square Feet (thousands) October 28, 2006 3,138 753 2,450 100 6,441 New 29 41 152 39 261 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 19 2 (9 )(1) 12 Closed (15 ) (6 ) (21 ) February 3, 2007 3,171 788 2,604 130 6,693 Average Store Size 8,808 4,452 6,626 9,286 7,090 (1) Includes one RUEHL store temporarily closed due to fire damage.

In Fiscal 2006 total capital expenditures were $403.5 million of which $253.7 million was used for store related projects related to store refresh, new construction, remodels and conversions, including approximately $40 million related to the refresh of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $149.8 million was used for projects at the home office, including the new DC, home office expansion, information technology investments and other projects. In Fiscal 2005 total capital expenditures were $256.4 million of which $204.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $51.7 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office expansion, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. In Fiscal 2004 total capital expenditures were $185.1 million of which $169.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $15.4 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store leases. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $49.4 million, $42.3 million and $55.0 million in construction allowances during Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. During Fiscal 2007, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between $395 million and $405 million. Approximately $220 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels. Approximately $60 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refresh will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, the store refresh will include the addition of video walls at existing Hollister stores and fixtures to stores throughout the Hollister chain. The Company is planning approximately $85 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to new office buildings, information technology investment and new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems. In March 2007, the Company decided to allocate approximately $35 million for the purchase of an airplane. With planned expansion in Europe and Asia over the next several years, the Company concluded that acquiring a plane is more beneficial than continuing multiple fractional share ownership programs in meeting the business travel needs of its Chief Executive Officer and senior management team. The Company intends to add approximately 750,000 to 800,000 gross square feet of stores during Fiscal 2007, which will represent an increase of approximately 11% to 12% over Fiscal 2006. The Company anticipates the increase during Fiscal 2007 primarily due to the addition of approximately 67 new Hollister stores, 27 abercrombie stores, six Abercrombie Fitch stores and ten RUEHL stores. Additionally, the Company plans to introduce its next concept with the opening of approximately three stores in January 2008 and approximately four additional stores by March 2008. 46 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2007, the Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new Hollister stores to increase from last years actual cost of approximately $130 to approximately $147. The Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new abercrombie stores to decrease from last years actual cost of approximately $169 to approximately $164. The change from last years estimates for Hollister and abercrombie were driven by a number of factors, including store location, construction material pricing, landlord allowance levels, and furniture and fixture additions. During Fiscal 2007, the Company expects average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new non flagship Abercrombie Fitch stores to be approximately $115 and for new RUEHL stores to be approximately $274 per square foot, net of construction allowances. The Company believes that the construction costs for Abercrombie Fitch and RUEHL stores in Fiscal 2006 were not representative of the costs the Company expects to incur in Fiscal 2007 and therefore comparisons with these numbers would not be meaningful. The Company expects initial inventory purchases for the stores to average approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million per store for Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister and RUEHL, respectively. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Amended Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Direct to consumer sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping and handling costs are classified as stores and distribution expense. Associate discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Companys gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. The liability remains on the Companys books until the earlier of redemption (recognized as revenue) or when the Company determines the likelihood of redemption is remote (recognized as other operating income). The Company determines the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns and at these times recognizes the remaining balance as other operating income. At February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the gift card liability on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet was $65.0 million and $53.2 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents The Company is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the states in which it operates. During Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, the Company recognized other operating income for adjustments to the gift card liability of $5.2 million, $2.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method. The Company determines market value as the anticipated future selling price of the merchandise less a normal margin. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. At first and third fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory. At second and fourth fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future selling price decreases necessary to sell through any remaining carryover inventory from the season just passed. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrink estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. An increase or decrease in the inventory shrink estimate of 10% would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Management believes this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, the lesser of ten years or the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and three to ten years for other property and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortizations are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flow. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. A valuation allowance has been provided for losses related to the start up costs associated with operations in foreign countries. No other valuation allowances have been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. 48 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the quarter. The Company records tax expense or benefit that does not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which it occurs pursuant to the requirements of APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting and Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation (FIN) 18, Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 28. Examples of such types of discrete items include, but are not limited to, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, provision to return adjustments, tax exempt income and the settlement of tax audits. Foreign Currency Translation Some of the Companys international operations use local currencies as the functional currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars (the reporting currency) at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations, whereas related translation adjustments are reported as an element of other comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. The Company accrues for its legal obligations for outstanding bills, expected defense costs and, if appropriate, settlements. Accruals are made for personnel, general litigation and intellectual property cases. Equity Compensation Expense Prior to January 29, 2006, the Company reported share based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB No. 123, but elected to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for which no expense was recognized for stock options if the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant, and provided the required pro forma disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), as amended. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123(R) which requires stock options to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. 49 Table of Contents The Companys equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants, which requires the Company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the term. The term represents the expected period of time the Company believes the options will be outstanding based on historical information. Estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the Companys stock for the period equal to the expected term of the stock option. The Company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for stock splits. The fair value calculation under the Black Scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the term and volatility assumptions. Increases in term or volatility will result in a higher fair valuation of stock option grants. Assuming all other assumptions disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Share Based Compensation, being equal, a 10% increase in term will yield a 5% increase in the Black Scholes valuation, while a 10% increase in volatility will yield a 7% increase in the Black Scholes valuation. The Company believes that changes in term and volatility would not have a material effect on the Companys results since the number of stock options granted during the periods presented was not material. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the FASB released Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the measurement, classification and disclosure of tax return positions in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. An analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete; however, the Company expects to record an adjustment to reduce opening retained earnings in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 by an amount which is not material to its financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 requires a dual approach for quantifications of errors using both a method that focuses on the income statement impact, including the cumulative effect of prior years misstatements, and a method that focuses on the period end balance sheet. SAB No. 108 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2007. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB released FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under GAAP and also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 157. 50 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB released FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that select different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 will be effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 159. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in marketable securities, which primarily consist of investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities, all classified as available for sale and have maturities ranging from three months to forty years. These securities are consistent with the investment objectives contained within the investment policy established by the Companys Board of Directors. The basic objectives of the investment policy are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements and maximizing net after tax yield. Investments in municipal notes and bonds have early redemption provisions at predetermined prices. Taking these provisions into account, none of these investments extend beyond five years. The Company believes that a significant increase in interest rates could result in a material loss if the Company sells the investment prior to the early redemption provision. For Fiscal 2006, there were no realized gains or losses, and as of February 3, 2007, net unrealized holding losses were approximately $0.7 million. Despite the underlying long term maturity of auction rate securities, from the investors perspective, such securities are priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates are reset through an auction process at predetermined periods ranging from seven to 49 days. Failed auctions rarely occur. As of February 3, 2007, the Company held approximately $447.8 million in available for sale securities classified as marketable securities. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company established an irrevocable rabbi trust during the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the purpose is to be a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants in the Abercrombie Fitch Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Chief Executive Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. As of February 3, 2007, total assets related to the Rabbi Trust were $33.5 million, which included $18.3 million of available for sale securities and $15.3 million related to the cash surrender value of trust owned life insurance policies. The Rabbi Trust assets are consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 97 14 (EITF 97 14) and recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and were restricted as to their use as noted above. As of February 3, 2007 the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company has exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and operating expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in Euros, Canadian Dollars and British Pounds, but believes this exposure is immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Companys market risk profile as of February 3, 2007 has not significantly changed since January 28, 2006. 52 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 are compared to the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended January 28, 2006. Comparable store sales however, compare the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 4, 2006. The Company had net sales of $3.318 billion for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007, up 19.1% from $2.785 billion for the fifty two weeks ended January 28, 2006. Operating income for Fiscal 2006 increased 21.3% to $658.1 million from $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005. Operating income results for Fiscal 2006 included $14.1 million of expense related to SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). Operating income results for Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. Net income was $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006, up 26.4% from $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 for Fiscal 2006 compared to $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. The Company generated cash from operations of $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006 versus $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from strong sales and income growth. During Fiscal 2006, the Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, opening 70 new Hollister stores, 19 new abercrombie stores, eight new Abercrombie Fitch stores and seven new RUEHL stores, remodeling 13 Abercrombie Fitch stores, as well as refreshing existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The Company also used excess cash in Fiscal 2006 to pay dividends of $0.70 per share, a 16.7% increase over $0.60 per share in Fiscal 2005, for a total of $61.6 million. The Company believes that share repurchases and dividends are an important way for the Company to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility. 27 Table of Contents The following data represents the Companys consolidated statements of net income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2006* 2005 2004 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Goods Sold 33.4 33.5 33.6 GROSS PROFIT 66.6 66.5 66.4 Stores and Distribution Expense 35.8 35.9 36.5 Marketing, General and Administrative Expense 11.3 11.3 12.9 Other Operating Income, Net (0.3 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) OPERATING INCOME 19.8 19.5 17.2 Interest Income, Net (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 20.3 19.7 17.5 Provision for Income Taxes 7.5 7.7 6.8 NET INCOME 12.7 % 12.0 % 10.7 % * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. 28 Table of Contents FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial and operational data compares Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004: Change 2006 * 2005 2004 2006 2005 2005 2004 Net sales by brand (thousands) $ 3,318,158 $ 2,784,711 $ 2,021,253 19 % 38 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 1,515,123 $ 1,424,013 $ 1,210,222 6 % 18 % abercrombie $ 405,820 $ 344,938 $ 227,204 18 % 52 % Hollister $ 1,363,233 $ 999,212 $ 579,687 36 % 72 % RUEHL** $ 33,982 $ 16,548 $ 4,140 105 % nm Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales*** 2% 26% 2% Abercrombie Fitch (4)% 18% (1)% abercrombie 10% 54% 1% Hollister 5% 29% 13% RUEHL** 14% n/a n/a Net retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, web sites and catalogue 17% 12% 16% Net retail sales per average store (thousands) $ 3,533 $ 3,284 $ 2,569 8 % 28 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 3,945 $ 3,784 $ 3,103 4 % 22 % abercrombie $ 2,251 $ 1,957 $ 1,241 15 % 58 % Hollister $ 3,732 $ 3,442 $ 2,740 8 % 26 % RUEHL** $ 3,248 $ 2,903 $ 1,255 12 % nm Net retail sales per average gross square foot $ 500 $ 464 $ 360 8 % 29 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 450 $ 432 $ 352 4 % 23 % abercrombie $ 513 $ 446 $ 282 15 % 58 % Hollister $ 568 $ 528 $ 423 8 % 25 % RUEHL** $ 363 $ 315 $ 136 15 % nm Transactions per average retail store 55,142 50,863 43,260 8 % 18 % Abercrombie Fitch 51,704 49,685 45,941 4 % 8 % abercrombie 34,786 30,356 21,740 15 % 40 % Hollister 68,740 64,913 56,687 6 % 15 % RUEHL** 38,554 26,215 12,913 47 % nm Average retail transaction value $ 64.07 $ 64.56 $ 59.38 (1 )% 9 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 76.30 $ 76.16 $ 67.54 nm 13 % abercrombie $ 64.72 $ 64.47 $ 57.10 nm 13 % Hollister $ 54.30 $ 53.03 $ 48.33 2 % 10 % RUEHL** $ 84.24 $ 110.74 $ 97.16 (24 )% 14 % Average units per retail transaction 2.35 2.25 2.26 4 % nm Abercrombie Fitch 2.26 2.18 2.22 4 % (2 )% abercrombie 2.78 2.66 2.68 5 % (1 )% Hollister 2.32 2.21 2.18 5 % 1 % RUEHL** 2.57 2.28 2.17 13 % 5 % Average unit retail sold $ 27.26 $ 28.69 $ 26.27 (5 )% 9 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 33.76 $ 34.94 $ 30.42 (3 )% 15 % abercrombie $ 23.28 $ 24.24 $ 21.31 (4 )% 14 % Hollister $ 23.41 $ 24.00 $ 22.17 (2 )% 8 % RUEHL** $ 32.78 $ 48.57 $ 44.77 (33 )% 8 % * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. ** Net sales for RUEHL during Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, and the related statistics, reflect the activity of 14 stores open in Fiscal 2006, eight stores open in Fiscal 2005, and four stores open in Fiscal 2004. As a result, year to year comparisons may not be meaningful. *** A store is included in comparable store sales when it has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year. Note Fiscal 2006 comparable store sales are compared to the comparable store sales for the fifty three weeks ended February 4, 2006. 29 Table of Contents CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK In Fiscal 2006, the Company continued to grow the business. Despite performance that was very challenging to build on in Fiscal 2005, the Company achieved a 2% increase in comparable store sales and a 19.1% increase in net sales in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales was driven by a combination of new store growth, an increase in the direct to consumer business, increases in transactions per store and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. Overall, the Company was able to make significant investments in future growth while improving operating income, as a percentage of sales, to 19.8%. These investments are summarized below. The first major area of investment was strengthening the iconic nature of the Companys brands. During Fiscal 2006, the Company eliminated distinct seasonal sales events to ensure that full price merchandise was available at stores during the transition from one season to the next. In addition, the Company refreshed select Abercrombie Fitch stores with the objective of replicating certain aspects of the Fifth Avenue Flagship store experience. Finally, the Company increased salary levels in several store manager categories in an effort to continue attracting and retaining strong management teams. The second major area of investment was international growth. During Fiscal 2006 the Company expanded its Canadian operations from two stores to six. The Canadian stores generated approximately three times the sales per square foot of an average U.S. store. As a result of the success of the Canadian stores, the Company is exploring the opportunity of expanding the abercrombie brand into Canada in Fiscal 2007. During Fiscal 2006 the Company also invested its resources and focus on building and staffing its U.K. London flagship Abercrombie Fitch store. The store opened on March 22, 2007 and the initial results exceeded the Companys expectations. The third major area of investment was infrastructure to support the future growth of the Company. In Fiscal 2006, the Company opened its second DC which increased the Companys capacity to support stores by approximately 800 stores. In addition, the Company continued to invest in staffing on both the creative and administrative sides of the business in order to offset the effect of underinvestment in prior years. For Fiscal 2007, the Company does not anticipate additions to headcount at the same rate as in Fiscal 2006. The Company also opened an on campus merchandise research and development center known as the Innovation Design Center (IDC). The IDC produces graphic and wash samples for quick approval, and the final designs are packaged for vendor production. The IDC enables the Company to reduce the time to market for the latest fashion trends, saving time and expense while limiting the competitions ability to copy its designs. The fourth major area of investment was information technology. The Company invested in the upgrade of core systems to help run allocation, planning, sourcing and merchandising. The system upgrades are expected to make the Company more scalable, efficient and accurate in the production and delivery of merchandise to stores. The Company also continues to invest in best practice technologies that are expected to provide a clear competitive advantage. 30 Table of Contents The Company views the Hollister brand as having a growing iconic status and as a significant growth vehicle in the future. Hollisters success in Canada and the growth in international web sales have resulted in the Company investigating the acceleration of its international store rollout. Abercrombie Fitch is a maturing brand with an opportunity for future growth dependent on prime locations for its stores along with brand expansion outside of the United States. The Company is pursuing real estate in both Tokyo and key European markets for the next phase of international expansion for Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister stores. abercrombie is viewed as having growth opportunities within the United States, and the Company expects to grow the brand to about 250 locations, as well as possible expansion into Canada. RUEHL performed well in Fiscal 2006 with strong trends in many areas. Transactions per store increased and the brand achieved a 14% increase in comparable store sales, which the Company believes indicates RUEHL is building a strong customer base. The Company is targeting RUEHL Initial Markup (IMU) parity with the other brands as well as profitability by the end of Fiscal 2007. Additionally, the Company plans to introduce its next concept with the opening of approximately three stores in January 2008 and approximately four additional stores by March 2008. For Fiscal 2007, the Company will be faced with the challenge of improving on Fiscal 2006s performance. From a gross margin standpoint, while the Company has been able to improve its IMU in the past, the Company does not anticipate IMU improvements in its forecasts. The Company expects to leverage marketing, general and administrative expense in Fiscal 2007. However, with additional expenses such as store minimum wage increases, store manager payroll increases, new concept pre opening costs and incremental costs of operating the second DC, the Company does not anticipate leveraging stores and distribution expense on a flat to slightly positive comparable store sales increase in Fiscal 2007. The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 with inventories, at cost, up 6% per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The Company believes it will end the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 with inventory flat to slightly positive on a per gross square foot, at cost, when compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2006. During Fiscal 2007, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between $395 million and $405 million. Approximately $220 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels. Approximately $60 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refresh will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, the store refresh will include the addition of video walls at existing Hollister stores and fixtures to stores throughout the Hollister chain. The Company is planning approximately $85 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to new office buildings, information technology investment and new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems. In March 2007, the Company decided to allocate approximately $35 million for the purchase of an airplane. With planned expansion in Europe and Asia over the next several years, the Company concluded that acquiring a plane is more beneficial than continuing multiple fractional share ownership programs in meeting the business travel needs of its Chief Executive Officer and senior management team. 31 Table of Contents The following measurements are among the key business indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Companys results: Comparable store sales by brand, by product and by store, defined as year over year sales for a store that has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year; IMU; Selling margin, defined as sales price less original cost, by brand and by product category; Store metrics such as sales per gross square foot, average unit retail, average transaction values, store contribution (defined as store sales less direct costs of running the store), and average units per transaction; Markdown rate; Gross profit rate; Operating income; Net income; Inventory per gross square foot; and Cash flow and liquidity determined by the Companys current ratio and cash provided by operations. While not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company, due to the proprietary nature of the information, the Company publicly discloses and discusses several of these metrics as part of its financial summary and in several sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $1.139 billion, up 18.5% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $961.4 million. The net sales increase was primarily attributed to the net addition of 93 stores, including the full quarter impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue Flagship store and six stores in Canada; a 58% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fourteen week quarter in Fiscal 2006 versus a thirteen week quarter in Fiscal 2005, partially offset by a 3% decrease in comparable store sales. 32 Table of Contents Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the same quarter in Fiscal 2005 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 6% with womens comparable store sales decreasing by a high single digit and mens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie increased 2% with boys achieving a mid single digit increase and girls flat; Hollister was flat with bettys flat and dudes posting a decrease in the low single digits; and RUEHL increased 6% with womens realizing a mid single digit increase and mens posting a low single digit increase. On a regional basis, comparable store sales for the Company ranged from decreases in the high single digits to increases in the low single digits. Stores located in the New York and Mid Atlantic regions had the strongest comparable store sales performance and stores located in the West region had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included fleece, knit tops and underwear, while jeans, pants and sweaters posted negative comparable store sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included knit tops, fleece and shorts, while jeans, skirts and pants posted negative comparable store sales. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $74.8 million, an increase of 57.5% versus last years fourth quarter net sales of $47.5 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006 and $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 7.4% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $755.6 million compared to $639.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate (gross profit divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 66.4%, down 10 basis points from last years fourth quarter rate of 66.5%. The decrease in gross profit rate largely resulted from higher shrink and a slightly higher markdown rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU levels. The Company is targeting RUEHL IMU parity with the other brands by the end of Fiscal 2007. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $349.8 million compared to $293.5 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The stores and distribution expense rate (stores and distribution expense divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 30.7% up 20 basis points from 30.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in rate is primarily related to additional DC expenses associated with the second DC, which became fully operational in the fourth quarter, and direct to consumer expenses, which increased due to higher internet sales as a percentage of total sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased store expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling payroll, driven by management salary increases, state minimum wage increases and additional floor coverage to address shrink concerns increased as a percentage of sales. However, the increase in selling payroll was more than offset by leveraging other store related controllable expenses. 33 Table of Contents The DC productivity level, measured in units processed per labor hour (UPH), was 9% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The UPH rate increase was due to the second DC becoming fully operational during the fourth quarter. The Company expects the UPH level to increase during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $101.6 million compared to $80.8 million during the same period in Fiscal 2005. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate (marketing, general and administrative expense divided by net sales) was 8.9% compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to higher home office payroll and consulting expenses. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $4.6 million compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Other operating income primarily related to the gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 increased to $308.8 million from $267.5 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 15.4%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 27.1% compared to 27.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $4.7 million in Fiscal 2006 compared to $2.4 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 36.8% as compared to 39.0% for the Fiscal 2005 comparable period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to favorable settlements of tax audits during the fourth quarter and the change in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $198.2 million versus $164.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 20.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $2.14, including $0.01 related to SFAS 123(R), versus $1.80 for the same period last year, an increase of 18.9%. 34 Table of Contents FISCAL 2006 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2006 were $3.318 billion, an increase of 19.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net sales of $2.785 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 93 stores, including the full year impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue Flagship store and six stores in Canada; a 2% comparable store sales increase; a 42% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 4%; abercrombie increased 10%; Hollister increased 5%; and RUEHL increased 14%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2006, women, girls and bettys represented over 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. Comparable store sales by brand for the year for womens, girls and bettys were as follows: RUEHL women increased by the high fifties; Hollister bettys posted a mid twenties increase; abercrombie girls had a mid teens increase; and Abercrombie Fitch women had a low single digit increase. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2006 were $174.1 million, an increase of 42.1% versus last years net sales of $122.5 million for the comparable period. Shipping and handling revenue was $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006 and $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2006, gross profit increased to $2.209 billion from $1.851 billion in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2006 was 66.6% versus 66.5% the previous year, an increase of 10 basis points. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2006 was $1.187 billion compared to $1.001 billion for Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.8% compared to 35.9% in the previous year. The decrease in the rate primarily resulted from the Companys ability to leverage store related costs on a 2% increase in comparable store sales. The DCs UPH rate for the year was flat in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2006, while the second DC was being built, the overall DCs UPH was impacted by the Companys first DC reaching near capacity, a result of the Companys focus on strategically flowing inventory to stores throughout the year. The Company expects the UPH level to increase during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2006 was $373.8 million compared to $313.5 million in Fiscal 2005. For the current year, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3%, flat compared to Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included a charge of $13.6 million related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $10.0 million compared to $5.5 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote and insurance reimbursements received during the first and second quarters for Fiscal 2006 related to stores damaged by fire and Hurricane Katrina, respectively. Operating Income Fiscal 2006 operating income was $658.1 million compared to $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 21.3%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2006 was 19.8% versus 19.5% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2006 was $13.9 million compared to $6.7 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2006 was 37.2% compared to 39.2% for Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate related primarily to favorable settlements of tax audits, favorable changes in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters and an increase in tax exempt income during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 tax expense reflected a charge related to the Companys change in estimate of the potential outcome of certain state tax matters. The Company estimates that the annual effective tax rate for Fiscal 2007 will be approximately 39%. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2006 was $422.2 million versus $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 26.4%. Net income included after tax charges of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2006 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 in Fiscal 2006 versus $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $961.4 million, up 39.9% versus net sales of $687.3 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 28% for the quarter, the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005, and an increase in direct to consumer business net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) of $8.1 million versus the comparable period in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. 36 Table of Contents By merchandise brand, comparable store sales for the quarter were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18% with womens comparable store sales increasing by a low twenties percentage and mens increasing by a mid teen percentage; abercrombie achieved a 59% increase in comparable store sales with girls achieving a high sixties increase and boys posting a high thirties increase; and Hollister increased by 34% for the fourth quarter with bettys increasing comparable store sales by a mid thirties percentage and dudes realizing an increase in the low thirties. In RUEHL, there were eight stores open in Fiscal 2005 and four stores open in Fiscal 2004. As a result comparable store sales results were not meaningful. On a regional basis, comparable store sales increases for the Company ranged from the mid twenties to the low thirties across the United States. Stores located in the North Atlantic and Southwest had the best comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. In Abercrombie Fitch, the womens comparable store sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong performances in polos, fleece, outerwear and sweaters. The mens comparable store sales growth was driven by increases in polos, graphic tees, jeans and personal care, offset by decreases in woven shirts and accessories. In the kids business, the girls comparable store sales increased as a result of strong sales performances across the majority of the categories, led by polos, fleece, graphic tees and jeans. Boys comparable store sales increase was driven by the following categories: polos, jeans, graphic tees and fleece, offset by slight decreases in the woven shirt and activewear categories. In Hollister, bettys had strong comparable store sales increases in polos, fleece, sweaters and graphic tees. The increase in dudes comparable store sales was the result of strong performance in polos, graphic tees, fleece and personal care categories for the quarter, offset by decreases in woven shirts and sweaters. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales, which are sold through the Companys web sites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were $47.5 million, an increase of 18.5% versus net sales of $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005 and $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limited the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $639.4 million compared to $455.8 million in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 66.5%, up 20 basis points from a rate of 66.3% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The increase in gross profit rate resulted largely from a higher IMU during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 and a reduction in shrink versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate. The improvement in IMU during the fourth quarter was a result of higher average unit retail pricing across all brands. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU margins. 37 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $293.5 million compared to $223.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The stores and distribution expense rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 30.5% compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The Companys total store and distribution expense, as a percent of net sales, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 decreased 210 basis points versus the comparable period during Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs due to significant comparable store sales increases partially offset by increases in store management and loss prevention programs during Fiscal 2005. The leveraging of fixed costs included store payroll expense, rent, utilities and other landlord expense, depreciation and amortization and repairs and maintenance expense. The Company believes increases in store management and loss prevention programs were key in driving sales and reducing shrink levels during the quarter, which had a favorable impact on the Companys gross profit rate. The DC productivity level, measured in UPH, was 20% lower in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and from a change in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the DC approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in a lower productivity rate due to an increased handling of inventory. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $80.8 million compared to $66.1 million during the same period in Fiscal 2004. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 8.4% compared to 9.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to the Companys ability to leverage home office payroll, and a reduction in sample expenses and marketing expenses due to timing of photo shoots, offset by increases in outside services mostly due to legal costs. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $2.3 million compared to $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 increased to $267.5 million from $170.2 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.2%. The operating income rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 27.8% compared to 24.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. 38 Table of Contents Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $2.4 million in Fiscal 2005 compared to $1.3 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest income was due to higher rates on investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 when compared to the same period in Fiscal 2004. The Company continued to invest in investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was 39.0% compared to 39.2% for the Fiscal 2004 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $164.6 million versus $104.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004, an increase of 57.8%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 was $1.80 versus $1.15 for the comparable period in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 56.5%. FISCAL 2005 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2005 were $2.785 billion, an increase of 37.8% versus Fiscal 2004 net sales of $2.021 billion. The net sales increase was attributable to an increase in comparable store sales of 26% for the year, the net addition of 63 stores during Fiscal 2005, and a $13.9 million increase in net sales (including shipping and handling revenue) for the direct to consumer business. For the fiscal year, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 18%; abercrombie increased 54%; Hollister increased 29%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2005, women, girls and bettys represented over 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. abercrombie girls achieved a mid sixties increase, Hollister bettys achieved a low thirties increase and Abercrombie Fitch women had a high teens increase. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2005 were $122.5 million, an increase of 10.8% versus Fiscal 2004 net sales of $110.6 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005 and $15.7 million in Fiscal 2004. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2005 compared to 6.2% of net sales in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in sales penetration during Fiscal 2005 was due to the implementation of brand protection initiatives throughout the year that reduced the amount of sale merchandise available on the web sites and limited the customers ability to purchase large quantities of the same item. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2005, gross profit increased to $1.851 billion from $1.341 billion in Fiscal 2004. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2005 was 66.5% versus 66.4% the previous year. The gross profit rate increase of 10 basis points reflects higher initial markup and a reduction in shrink, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate in Fiscal 2004. 39 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2005 was $1.001 billion compared to $738.2 million for Fiscal 2004. For Fiscal 2005, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.9% compared to 36.5% in the previous year. The Companys total store and distribution expense, as a percent of net sales, during Fiscal 2005 decreased 60 basis points versus Fiscal 2004 as a result of the Companys ability to leverage fixed costs, due to significant comparable store sales increases, partially offset by increased store payroll and store management expense. The leveraging of fixed costs included rent, utilities and other landlord expenses, depreciation and amortization and repairs and maintenance expense. The DCs UPH rate for the year was 7% lower in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004. The UPH rate decrease resulted from increases in inventory and changes in the way the Company flowed merchandise to its stores. Merchandise was routed to the stores in a more gradual process in order to avoid stockroom congestion at the stores. This resulted in the DC approaching capacity levels, which in turn resulted in a lower productivity rate due to increased inventory handling. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2005 was $313.5 million compared to $259.8 million in Fiscal 2004. For Fiscal 2005, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3% compared to 12.9% in Fiscal 2004. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to a non recurring charge of $40.9 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement and leverage in the home office payroll expense, offset by a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and legal costs. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2005 was $5.5 million compared to $4.5 million for Fiscal 2004. The increase in other operating income was related to the favorable settlement of a class action lawsuit related to credit card fees in which the Company was a class member and lease buyout payments from landlords, partially offset by a lower amount of gift card liability recognized as other income for gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. Operating Income Fiscal 2005 operating income was $542.7 million compared to $347.6 million for Fiscal 2004, an increase of 56.1%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2005 was 19.5% versus 17.2% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2005 was $6.7 million compared to $5.2 million for the previous year. The increase in net interest income was due to the Company receiving higher rates on its investments, partially offset by lower average investment balances during Fiscal 2005 when compared to Fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2005 was 39.2% compared to 38.7% for Fiscal 2004. The increase in the annual effective tax rate was due to the Companys change of estimates in the potential outcomes of certain state tax matters in Fiscal 2005. 40 Table of Contents Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2005 was $334.0 million versus $216.4 million in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 54.3%. Net income included after tax non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement of an executive officer and $25.6 million in Fiscal 2004 related to a legal settlement. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $3.66 in Fiscal 2005 versus $2.28 in Fiscal 2004, an increase of 60.5%. The percentage increase in net income per diluted share outstanding was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the impact of the Companys share repurchase program. In Fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares. FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income resulted in higher cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company believes cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will continue to provide adequate resources to support operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.175 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors will review the Companys cash position and results of operations and address the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization for the last three fiscal years follows (thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Working capital $ 581,451 $ 455,530 $ 241,572 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 1,405,297 $ 995,117 $ 669,326 The increase in working capital during Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys net income increase and decreases in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses. The increase in working capital in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys net sales increase, and the increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable. The Company considers the following to be measures of its liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.14 1.93 1.56 Net cash provided by operating activities(thousands) $ 582,171 * $ 453,590 $ 423,784 * Fiscal 2006 is a fifty three week year. 41 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary source of liquidity, increased to $582.2 million for Fiscal 2006 from $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash in Fiscal 2006 was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and lessor construction allowances collected. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and payment of income taxes. Cash in Fiscal 2005 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges, lessor construction allowances collected and decreases in payments of income taxes. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of increases in inventory. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $453.6 million for Fiscal 2005 from $423.8 million in Fiscal 2004. Cash in Fiscal 2004 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and lessor construction allowances collected and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and other assets and liabilities. The Companys operations are seasonal and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters as the Company builds inventory in anticipation of these selling periods. Investing Activities Cash outflows for Fiscal 2006 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities, the purchase of trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures. As of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the Company held $466.1 million and $411.2 million, respectively, of available for sale securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days .. Of the $466.1 million of available for sale securities held as of February 3, 2007, $447.8 million were classified as marketable securities while $18.3 million were held in an irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust) and were classified as other assets.

As January 28, 2006, the Company held $411.2 million of available for sale securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days classified as marketable securities. Cash inflows for Fiscal 2004 were primarily the result of proceeds from sales of marketable securities, offset by capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures and Lessor Construction Allowances for additional information. As of January 29, 2005, all investments had maturities of less than 90 days and accordingly were classified as cash equivalents. Financing Activities Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the payment of dividends and a change in outstanding checks in Fiscal 2006. Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of the Companys Class A Common Stock and the payment of dividends in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Cash inflows consisted of stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. The Company did not repurchase shares in Fiscal 2006. The Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares and approximately 11.2 million shares of its Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized stock repurchase programs in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had approximately 5.7 million shares available to repurchase under the 6.0 million shares authorized by the Board of Directors in August 2005. 42 Table of Contents On December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement). The primary purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement are for trade and stand by letters of credit and working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including an option where interest rates are based on the agent banks Alternate Base Rate, and another using the London Interbank Offered Rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the ratio of the Companys leveraged total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for the trailing four fiscal quarter periods. The facility fees are projected to accrue at either 0.15% or 0.175% on the committed amounts per annum. The Amended Credit Agreement contains limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale leaseback transactions, significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions with third parties, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and stock repurchases) and transactions with affiliates.

No borrowings were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 3, 2007 or on January 28, 2006. Standby letters of credit totaling approximately $4.9 million and $4.5 million were outstanding on February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. The standby letters of credit are set to expire primarily during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of February 3, 2007, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Lease Obligations $ 1,671,681 $ 215,499 $ 422,500 $ 373,454 $ 660,228 Purchase Obligations 216,899 216,899 Other Obligations 77,332 66,449 10,883 Totals $ 1,965,912 $ 498,847 $ 433,383 $ 373,454 $ 660,228 Operating lease obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance (CAM), insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. Total expense related to CAM, insurance and taxes was $107.4 million in Fiscal 2006. The purchase obligations category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2007 and commitments for fabric to be used during the next season. Other obligations primarily represent preventive maintenance contracts for Fiscal 2007 and letters of credit outstanding as of February 3, 2007 (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. 43 Table of Contents STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2006, respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Total October 28, 2006 358 171 372 11 912 New 3 8 21 4 36 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 1 (1 )(1) Closed (2 ) (2 ) (4 ) February 3, 2007 360 177 393 14 944 Gross Square Feet (thousands) October 28, 2006 3,138 753 2,450 100 6,441 New 29 41 152 39 261 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 19 2 (9 )(1) 12 Closed (15 ) (6 ) (21 ) February 3, 2007 3,171 788 2,604 130 6,693 Average Store Size 8,808 4,452 6,626 9,286 7,090 (1) Includes one RUEHL store temporarily closed due to fire damage.

In Fiscal 2006 total capital expenditures were $403.5 million of which $253.7 million was used for store related projects related to store refresh, new construction, remodels and conversions, including approximately $40 million related to the refresh of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $149.8 million was used for projects at the home office, including the new DC, home office expansion, information technology investments and other projects. In Fiscal 2005 total capital expenditures were $256.4 million of which $204.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $51.7 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office expansion, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. In Fiscal 2004 total capital expenditures were $185.1 million of which $169.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction, remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $15.4 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store leases. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $49.4 million, $42.3 million and $55.0 million in construction allowances during Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. During Fiscal 2007, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between $395 million and $405 million. Approximately $220 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels. Approximately $60 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refresh will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, the store refresh will include the addition of video walls at existing Hollister stores and fixtures to stores throughout the Hollister chain. The Company is planning approximately $85 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to new office buildings, information technology investment and new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems. In March 2007, the Company decided to allocate approximately $35 million for the purchase of an airplane. With planned expansion in Europe and Asia over the next several years, the Company concluded that acquiring a plane is more beneficial than continuing multiple fractional share ownership programs in meeting the business travel needs of its Chief Executive Officer and senior management team. The Company intends to add approximately 750,000 to 800,000 gross square feet of stores during Fiscal 2007, which will represent an increase of approximately 11% to 12% over Fiscal 2006. The Company anticipates the increase during Fiscal 2007 primarily due to the addition of approximately 67 new Hollister stores, 27 abercrombie stores, six Abercrombie Fitch stores and ten RUEHL stores. Additionally, the Company plans to introduce its next concept with the opening of approximately three stores in January 2008 and approximately four additional stores by March 2008. 46 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2007, the Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new Hollister stores to increase from last years actual cost of approximately $130 to approximately $147. The Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new abercrombie stores to decrease from last years actual cost of approximately $169 to approximately $164. The change from last years estimates for Hollister and abercrombie were driven by a number of factors, including store location, construction material pricing, landlord allowance levels, and furniture and fixture additions. During Fiscal 2007, the Company expects average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new non flagship Abercrombie Fitch stores to be approximately $115 and for new RUEHL stores to be approximately $274 per square foot, net of construction allowances. The Company believes that the construction costs for Abercrombie Fitch and RUEHL stores in Fiscal 2006 were not representative of the costs the Company expects to incur in Fiscal 2007 and therefore comparisons with these numbers would not be meaningful. The Company expects initial inventory purchases for the stores to average approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million per store for Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister and RUEHL, respectively. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its Amended Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with either cash or credit card. Direct to consumer sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping and handling costs are classified as stores and distribution expense. Associate discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Companys gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. The liability remains on the Companys books until the earlier of redemption (recognized as revenue) or when the Company determines the likelihood of redemption is remote (recognized as other operating income). The Company determines the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns and at these times recognizes the remaining balance as other operating income. At February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the gift card liability on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet was $65.0 million and $53.2 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents The Company is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the states in which it operates. During Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, the Company recognized other operating income for adjustments to the gift card liability of $5.2 million, $2.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method. The Company determines market value as the anticipated future selling price of the merchandise less a normal margin. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. At first and third fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory. At second and fourth fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future selling price decreases necessary to sell through any remaining carryover inventory from the season just passed. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrink estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. An increase or decrease in the inventory shrink estimate of 10% would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Management believes this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, the lesser of ten years or the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and three to ten years for other property and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortizations are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flow. Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. A valuation allowance has been provided for losses related to the start up costs associated with operations in foreign countries. No other valuation allowances have been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions. 48 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the quarter. The Company records tax expense or benefit that does not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which it occurs pursuant to the requirements of APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting and Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation (FIN) 18, Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 28. Examples of such types of discrete items include, but are not limited to, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, provision to return adjustments, tax exempt income and the settlement of tax audits. Foreign Currency Translation Some of the Companys international operations use local currencies as the functional currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars (the reporting currency) at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations, whereas related translation adjustments are reported as an element of other comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. The Company accrues for its legal obligations for outstanding bills, expected defense costs and, if appropriate, settlements. Accruals are made for personnel, general litigation and intellectual property cases. Equity Compensation Expense Prior to January 29, 2006, the Company reported share based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB No. 123, but elected to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for which no expense was recognized for stock options if the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant, and provided the required pro forma disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), as amended. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123(R) which requires stock options to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. 49 Table of Contents The Companys equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants, which requires the Company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the term. The term represents the expected period of time the Company believes the options will be outstanding based on historical information. Estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the Companys stock for the period equal to the expected term of the stock option. The Company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for stock splits. The fair value calculation under the Black Scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the term and volatility assumptions. Increases in term or volatility will result in a higher fair valuation of stock option grants. Assuming all other assumptions disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Share Based Compensation, being equal, a 10% increase in term will yield a 5% increase in the Black Scholes valuation, while a 10% increase in volatility will yield a 7% increase in the Black Scholes valuation. The Company believes that changes in term and volatility would not have a material effect on the Companys results since the number of stock options granted during the periods presented was not material. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the FASB released Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the measurement, classification and disclosure of tax return positions in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. An analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete; however, the Company expects to record an adjustment to reduce opening retained earnings in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 by an amount which is not material to its financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 requires a dual approach for quantifications of errors using both a method that focuses on the income statement impact, including the cumulative effect of prior years misstatements, and a method that focuses on the period end balance sheet. SAB No. 108 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2007. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB released FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under GAAP and also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 157. 50 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB released FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that select different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 will be effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 159. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in marketable securities, which primarily consist of investment grade municipal notes and bonds and investment grade auction rate securities, all classified as available for sale and have maturities ranging from three months to forty years. These securities are consistent with the investment objectives contained within the investment policy established by the Companys Board of Directors. The basic objectives of the investment policy are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements and maximizing net after tax yield. Investments in municipal notes and bonds have early redemption provisions at predetermined prices. Taking these provisions into account, none of these investments extend beyond five years. The Company believes that a significant increase in interest rates could result in a material loss if the Company sells the investment prior to the early redemption provision. For Fiscal 2006, there were no realized gains or losses, and as of February 3, 2007, net unrealized holding losses were approximately $0.7 million. Despite the underlying long term maturity of auction rate securities, from the investors perspective, such securities are priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates are reset through an auction process at predetermined periods ranging from seven to 49 days. Failed auctions rarely occur. As of February 3, 2007, the Company held approximately $447.8 million in available for sale securities classified as marketable securities. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company established an irrevocable rabbi trust during the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the purpose is to be a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants in the Abercrombie Fitch Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Chief Executive Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. As of February 3, 2007, total assets related to the Rabbi Trust were $33.5 million, which included $18.3 million of available for sale securities and $15.3 million related to the cash surrender value of trust owned life insurance policies. The Rabbi Trust assets are consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 97 14 (EITF 97 14) and recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and were restricted as to their use as noted above. As of February 3, 2007 the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company has exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and operating expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in Euros, Canadian Dollars and British Pounds, but believes this exposure is immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Companys market risk profile as of February 3, 2007 has not significantly changed since January 28, 2006. 52 Table of Contents
