ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31, typically resulting in a fifty two week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a fifty three week year. A store is included in comparable store sales when it has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year. Fiscal 2007 includes fifty two weeks and Fiscal 2006 includes fifty three weeks. For purposes of ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 2, 2008 are compared to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007. For Fiscal 2007, comparable store sales compare the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 2, 2008 to the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 3, 2007. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales compare the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 4, 2006. The Company had net sales of $3.750 billion for the fifty two weeks ended February 2, 2008, up 13.0% from $3.318 billion for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007. Operating income for Fiscal 2007 increased 12.5% to $740.5 million from $658.1 million for Fiscal 2006. Net income was $475.7 million in Fiscal 2007, up 12.7% from $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $5.20 for Fiscal 2007 compared to $4.59 in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 13.3%. The Company generated cash from operations of $817.8 million in Fiscal 2007 versus $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006, resulting primarily from a reduction in inventory and sales and earnings growth. During Fiscal 2007, the Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, including the opening of 58 new Hollister stores, 25 new abercrombie stores, seven new RUEHL stores, six new Abercrombie Fitch stores and three new Gilly Hicks stores, as well as the remodeling, converting or refreshing of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister and RUEHL stores. The Company also used excess cash in Fiscal 2007 to pay dividends of $0.70 per share, for a total of $61.3 million and to repurchase approximately 3.6 million shares of AF Common Stock with a value of approximately $287.9 million. The Company believes that share repurchases and dividends are an important way for the Company to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support daily operations, fund growth initiatives and provide a degree of protection against unanticipated business volatility. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. 26 Table of Contents The following data represents the Companys Consolidated Statements of Net Income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2007 2006* 2005 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Goods Sold 33.0 33.4 33.5 GROSS PROFIT 67.0 66.6 66.5 Stores and Distribution Expense 37.0 35.8 35.9 Marketing, General and Administrative Expense 10.6 11.3 11.3 Other Operating Income, Net (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.2 ) OPERATING INCOME 19.7 19.8 19.5 Interest Income, Net (0.5 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 20.2 20.3 19.7 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.5 7.7 NET INCOME 12.7 % 12.7 % 12.0 % * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. 27 Table of Contents FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial and operational data compares Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005: Change 2007 2006* 2005 2007 2006 2006 2005 Net sales by brand (thousands) $ 3,749,847 $ 3,318,158 $ 2,784,711 13 % 19 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 1,638,929 $ 1,515,123 $ 1,424,013 8 % 6 % abercrombie $ 471,045 $ 405,820 $ 344,938 16 % 18 % Hollister $ 1,589,452 $ 1,363,233 $ 999,212 17 % 36 % RUEHL $ 50,191 $ 33,982 $ 16,548 48 % 105 % Gilly Hicks*** $ 230 n/a n/a n/a n/a Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales** (1 )% 2 % 26 % Abercrombie Fitch 0 % (4 )% 18 % abercrombie 0 % 10 % 54 % Hollister (2 )% 5 % 29 % RUEHL (9 )% 14 % n/a Net retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, web sites and catalogue 14 % 17 % 12 % Net retail sales per average store (thousands) $ 3,470 $ 3,533 $ 3,284 (2 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 4,073 $ 3,945 $ 3,784 3 % 4 % abercrombie $ 2,230 $ 2,251 $ 1,957 (1 )% 15 % Hollister $ 3,550 $ 3,732 $ 3,442 (5 )% 8 % RUEHL $ 2,602 $ 3,248 $ 2,903 (20 )% 12 % Net retail sales per average gross square foot $ 489 $ 500 $ 464 (2 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 463 $ 450 $ 432 3 % 4 % abercrombie $ 493 $ 513 $ 446 (4 )% 15 % Hollister $ 531 $ 568 $ 528 (7 )% 7 % RUEHL $ 282 $ 363 $ 315 (22 )% 15 % Transactions per average retail store 53,152 55,142 50,863 (4 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch 49,915 51,704 49,685 (3 )% 4 % abercrombie 33,907 34,786 30,356 (3 )% 15 % Hollister 65,564 68,740 64,913 (5 )% 6 % RUEHL 31,880 38,554 26,215 (17 )% 47 % Average retail transaction value $ 65.29 $ 64.07 $ 64.56 2 % (1 )% Abercrombie Fitch $ 81.59 $ 76.30 $ 76.16 7 % 0 % abercrombie $ 65.76 $ 64.72 $ 64.47 2 % 0 % Hollister $ 54.15 $ 54.30 $ 53.03 0 % 2 % RUEHL $ 81.61 $ 84.24 $ 110.74 (3 )% (24 )% Average units per retail transaction 2.42 2.35 2.25 3 % 4 % Abercrombie Fitch 2.37 2.26 2.18 5 % 4 % abercrombie 2.82 2.78 2.66 1 % 5 % Hollister 2.36 2.32 2.21 2 % 5 % RUEHL 2.48 2.57 2.28 (4 )% 13 % Average unit retail sold $ 26.98 $ 27.26 $ 28.69 (1 )% (5 )% Abercrombie Fitch $ 34.43 $ 33.76 $ 34.94 2 % (3 )% abercrombie $ 23.32 $ 23.28 $ 24.24 0 % (4 )% Hollister $ 22.94 $ 23.41 $ 24.00 (2 )% (2 )% RUEHL $ 32.91 $ 32.78 $ 48.57 0 % (33 )% * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. ** A store is included in comparable store sales when it has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.

The Company maintained high store sales productivity and a high operating margin, even as the Company continued to invest in the long term positioning of its brands. The Company believes its ability to maintain the sale of full priced merchandise and consistent high store sales productivity is a result of its commitment to offer trend right merchandise, with the highest level of quality, and to create an exceptional in store experience, which establishes an emotional connection with its customers. The Companys commitment to its brands is demonstrated by strategic investments made in the areas of stores, merchandise development and home office infrastructure, which the Company believes will enhance quality, improve productivity and support future growth. Specifically, major implementations in planning, merchandising and allocation information systems over the next year should generate supply chain improvements and serve as a platform for future growth and expansion, both domestically and internationally. The Company believes it has significant growth potential both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the Company believes its growth potential will come from proven brands like Hollister and developing concepts like Gilly Hicks. Internationally, the Company believes its growth will come from its Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister brands. Recent international performance highlights the opportunity for expansion. In Fiscal 2007, the three Abercrombie Fitch and three Hollister stores located in Canada continued to generate more than three times the sales productivity of the average U.S. counterpart and the Abercrombie Fitch London flagship generated substantial sales per selling square foot similar to the strong performance of the Fifth Avenue flagship. Tourist stores, such as Fifth Avenue in New York, Ala Moana in Hawaii and Aventura Mall in Miami, are among the top performing stores in the chain. Additionally, international direct to consumer sales increased 72.4% from Fiscal 2006. In 2008, the Company plans to open one Abercrombie Fitch store, three abercrombie stores and three Hollister stores in Canada. The Company also plans to enter the U.K. market with Hollister with the opening of four shopping center based stores in 2008. The first store is scheduled to open in October at Brent Cross Shopping Centre, outside of London. Construction is currently underway for the first Hollister flagship in the SoHo area of New York City. The multi level flagship is scheduled to open in Spring 2009. The Company anticipates the Hollister flagship to fortify the iconic status of the brand in order to support its international growth. Construction is also currently underway for the Abercrombie Fitch flagship in Tokyos Ginza district, with a planned opening in late 2009. Opportunities are also being assessed for the Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister brands in continental Europe and other sites in Japan. In addition to a focus on the domestic and international expansion of existing iconic brands, the Company also views new concepts as an integral part of its long term strategy. In January 2008, the Company launched its fifth concept, Gilly Hicks. This concept provides the opportunity to expand the existing emotional connection with the Companys female customers by offering bras, underwear, personal care products, sleepwear and at home products. The Company operated three Gilly Hicks stores at the end of Fiscal 2007 and plans to open 15 stores in Fiscal 2008. 29 Table of Contents Although profitability was not achieved as originally expected, RUEHL made significant progress in Fiscal 2007 with improvements to gross margin and reductions in store operating and store construction costs. In Fiscal 2008, the Company will continue to focus on improving the quality level of the merchandise in order to be consistent with the brands positioning and pricing strategy. The Company expects brand awareness to grow from the RUEHL website which has offered a full product assortment since January 2008. However, the Company will moderate the pace of new store openings until RUEHL can be established as a proven concept. The Company also views product line expansion through its existing brands as another promising growth opportunity. In October 2007, the Company launched a body care line in 93 Hollister stores for both Dudes and Bettys. Holiday purchases of body care products were primarily incremental transaction units indicating the product line is a way to help fuel organic sales growth. As a result, the Company has decided to expand the body care products to all Hollister stores in Fiscal 2008. The Company is in the midst of an investment and expansion phase targeted at driving consistent and sustainable long term value growth. The Company believes strongly in its brands and in the potential for its international expansion plan, and will continue to invest during economic cycles. If the current general macro economic downturn persists and negatively impacts sales, the Companys cost structure will be aligned accordingly, but resource cuts that could jeopardize the ability to implement the Companys long term growth initiatives will be avoided. 30 Table of Contents The following measurements are among the key business indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Companys results: Comparable store sales by brand, by product and by store, defined as year over year sales for a store that has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year; Direct to consumer sales growth; International and flagship stores performance; New store productivity; IMU; Selling margin, defined as sales price less original cost, by brand and by product category; Stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales; Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales; Store metrics such as sales per gross square foot, sales per selling square foot, average unit retail, average number of transactions per store, average transaction values, store contribution (defined as store sales less direct costs of running the store), and average units per transaction; Markdown rate; Gross profit rate; Operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales; Net income; Inventory per gross square foot; and Cash flow and liquidity determined by the Companys current ratio and cash provided by operations. While not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company due to the proprietary nature of the information, the Company publicly discloses and discusses several of these metrics as part of its financial summary and in several sections within the Managements Discussion and Analysis. 31 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Fourth quarter net sales for the thirteen week period ended February 2, 2008 were $1.229 billion, up 7.9% versus net sales of $1.139 billion for the fourteen week period ended February 3, 2007. The net sales increase was attributed primarily to the net addition of 91 stores and a 46.8% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue), partially offset by an extra selling week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 and the resulting impact of the calendar shift in Fiscal 2007 due to Fiscal 2006 being a 53 week fiscal year, as well as a 1% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 1% with mens comparable store sales increasing by a low double digit and womens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie decreased 3% with boys increasing by a mid single digit and girls decreasing by a mid single digit; Hollister decreased 2% with dudes increasing by a high single digit and bettys decreasing by a mid single digit; and RUEHL decreased 19% with mens decreasing by a high single digit and womens decreasing by the high twenties. Comparable regional store sales ranged from increases in the high teens to decreases in the mid single digits. Stores located in Canada and the Southwest and North Atlantic regions had the strongest comparable store sales performance, while stores located in the South, Midwest and West regions had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included graphic tees, fragrance and fleece, while pants, jeans and knits posted negative comparable sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included graphics tees, jeans and sweaters, while knits and fleece posted negative comparable sales. Direct to consumer net merchandise sales, which are sold through the Companys websites and catalogue in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, were $108.6 million, an increase of 45.2% versus last years fourth quarter net merchandise sales of $74.8 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 10.1% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 compared to 7.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by store expansion, both domestically and internationally, improved in stock inventory availability, an improved targeted e mail marketing strategy and improved website functionality. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $825.6 million compared to $755.6 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The gross profit rate (gross profit divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 67.2%, up 80 basis points from last years fourth quarter rate of 66.4%. The increase in gross profit rate can be attributed to both a higher IMU rate and a lower shrink rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, partially offset by a higher markdown rate. 32 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $388.4 million compared to $349.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The stores and distribution expense rate (stores and distribution expense divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 31.6%, up 90 basis points from 30.7% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The increase in rate is primarily related to the impact of minimum wage and management salary increases and higher store fixed cost rates. The DC productivity level, measured in units processed per labor hour (UPH), was 16.1% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, reflecting the realization of increased efficiencies due to the second DC being operational during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $103.2 million compared to $101.6 million during the same period in Fiscal 2006. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate (marketing, general and administrative expense divided by net sales) was 8.4% compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was a result of lower travel, samples and outside service expense rates, partially offset by an increase in the home office payroll expense rate. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2007 was $3.0 million compared to $4.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The decrease was driven primarily by losses on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 as compared to gains on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 increased to $337.1 million from $308.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 9.2%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 27.4% compared to 27.1% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $6.4 million in Fiscal 2007 compared to $4.7 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 36.9% as compared to 36.8% for the Fiscal 2006 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $216.8 million versus $198.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, an increase of 9.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $2.40, versus $2.14 for the Fiscal 2006 comparable period, an increase of 12.2%. 33 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2007 were $3.750 billion, an increase of 13.0% versus Fiscal 2006 net sales of $3.318 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 91 stores and a 50% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue), partially offset by a 1% comparable store sales decrease and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2007. For Fiscal 2007, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie comparable sales were flat; Hollister decreased 2%; and RUEHL decreased 9%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2007, womens, girls and bettys represented at least 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2007 were $258.9 million, an increase of 49% versus Fiscal 2006 net merchandise sales of $174.1 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $39.1 million in Fiscal 2007 and $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 8.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2007 compared to 6.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by store expansion, both domestically and internationally, improved in stock inventory availability, an improved targeted e mail marketing strategy and improved website functionality. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2007, gross profit increased to $2.511 billion from $2.209 billion in Fiscal 2006. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2007 was 67.0% versus 66.6% the previous year, an increase of 40 basis points. The increase in the gross profit rate was driven primarily by a higher IMU rate and a lower shrink rate in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, partially offset by a higher markdown rate. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2007 was $1.387 billion compared to $1.187 billion for Fiscal 2006. For Fiscal 2007, the stores and distribution expense rate was 37.0% compared to 35.8% in the previous year. The increase in rate resulted primarily from store payroll, including minimum wage and store manager salary increases, higher store fixed cost rates and store packaging and supply expenses. The DCs UPH rate for Fiscal 2007 increased 9.1% as compared to Fiscal 2006, reflecting the realization of efficiencies obtained during Fiscal 2007 due to the second DC being operational. The Company expects the overall UPH level to continue to improve during Fiscal 2008, however at a lower rate than Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2007 was $395.8 million compared to $373.8 million in Fiscal 2006. For the current year, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 10.6%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared to last years rate of 11.3%. The decrease in rate resulted from reductions in travel, samples and outside services expense rates, partially offset by the increase in payroll expense rate. 34 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2007 was $11.7 million compared to $10.0 million for Fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote, partially offset by decreases in gains related to foreign currency transactions. The comparable year to date period in Fiscal 2006 included other operating income related to insurance reimbursements for a fire damaged store and a store damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Operating Income Fiscal 2007 operating income was $740.5 million compared to $658.1 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of 12.5%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2007 was 19.7% versus 19.8% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2007 was $18.8 million compared to $13.9 million for Fiscal 2006. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2007 was 37.4% compared to 37.2% for Fiscal 2006. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2007 was $475.7 million versus $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 12.7%. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $5.20 in Fiscal 2007 versus $4.59 in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 13.3%. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $1.139 billion, up 18.5% versus net sales of $961.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The net sales increase was attributed primarily to the net addition of 93 stores, including the full quarter impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue flagship and six stores in Canada; a 58% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fourteen week quarter in Fiscal 2006 versus a thirteen week quarter in Fiscal 2005, partially offset by a 3% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 6% with womens comparable store sales decreasing by a high single digit and mens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie increased 2% with boys achieving a mid single digit increase and girls flat; Hollister was flat with bettys flat and dudes posting a decrease in the low single digits; and RUEHL increased 6% with womens realizing a mid single digit increase and mens posting a low single digit increase. On a regional basis, comparable store sales for the Company ranged from decreases in the high single digits to increases in the low single digits. Stores located in the North Atlantic region had the strongest comparable store sales performance and stores located in the West region had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. 35 Table of Contents From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included fleece, knit tops and underwear, while jeans, pants and sweaters posted negative comparable store sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included knit tops, fleece and shorts, while jeans, skirts and pants posted negative comparable store sales. Direct to consumer net merchandise sales, sold through the Companys websites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $74.8 million, an increase of 57.5% versus net merchandise sales of $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006 and $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 7.4% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $755.6 million compared to $639.4 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 66.4%, down 10 basis points from the Fiscal 2005 fourth quarter rate of 66.5%. The decrease in gross profit rate largely resulted from a higher shrink rate and a slightly higher markdown rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU levels. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $349.8 million compared to $293.5 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The stores and distribution expense rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 30.7%, up 20 basis points from 30.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in rate is primarily related to additional DC expenses associated with the second DC, which became fully operational in the fourth quarter, and direct to consumer expenses, which increased due to higher internet sales as a percentage of total sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased store expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling payroll, driven by management salary increases, state minimum wage increases and additional floor coverage to address shrink concerns increased as a percentage of sales. However, the increase in selling payroll was more than offset by leveraging other store related controllable expenses. The DC productivity level, measured in UPH, was 9% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The UPH rate increase was due to the second DC becoming fully operational during the fourth quarter. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $101.6 million compared to $80.8 million during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 8.9% compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to higher home office payroll and consulting expenses. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $4.6 million compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Other operating income related primarily to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 increased to $308.8 million from $267.5 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 15.4%. The operating income rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 27.1% compared to 27.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $4.7 million in Fiscal 2006 compared to $2.4 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 36.8% as compared to 39.0% for the Fiscal 2005 comparable period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was related primarily to favorable settlements of tax audits during the fourth quarter and the change in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $198.2 million versus $164.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 20.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $2.14, including $0.01 related to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), versus $1.80 for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 18.9%. FISCAL 2006 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2006 were $3.318 billion, an increase of 19.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net sales of $2.785 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 93 stores, including the full year impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue flagship and six stores in Canada; a 2% comparable store sales increase; a 42% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 4%; abercrombie increased 10%; Hollister increased 5%; and RUEHL increased 14%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2006 were $174.1 million, an increase of 42.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net merchandise sales of $122.5 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006 and $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.0% of net total sales in Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2006, gross profit increased to $2.209 billion from $1.851 billion in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2006 was 66.6% versus 66.5% for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 10 basis points. 37 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2006 was $1.187 billion compared to $1.001 billion for Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.8% compared to 35.9% in Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the rate resulted primarily from the Companys ability to leverage store related costs on a 2% increase in comparable store sales. The DCs UPH rate for the year was flat in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2006, while the second DC was being built, the overall DCs UPH was impacted by the Companys first DC reaching near capacity, a result of the Companys focus on strategically flowing inventory to stores during Fiscal 2006. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2006 was $373.8 million compared to $313.5 million in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3%, which was flat compared to Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included a charge of $13.6 million related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement with an executive officer. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $10.0 million compared to $5.5 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote and insurance reimbursements received during the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2006 related to stores damaged by fire and Hurricane Katrina, respectively. Operating Income Fiscal 2006 operating income was $658.1 million compared to $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 21.3%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2006 was 19.8% versus 19.5% in Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2006 was $13.9 million compared to $6.7 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2006 was 37.2% compared to 39.2% for Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate primarily related to favorable settlements of tax audits, favorable changes in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters and an increase in tax exempt income during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 tax expense reflected a charge related to the Companys change in estimate of the potential outcome of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2006 was $422.2 million versus $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 26.4%. Net income included after tax charges of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2006 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), and non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement with an executive officer. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 in Fiscal 2006 versus $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. 38 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income and decreases in inventory resulted in increased cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company expects that substantially all future operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.175 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors of AF will review the Companys cash position and results of operations and address the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization at the end of the last three fiscal years follows (thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Working capital $ 597,142 $ 581,451 $ 455,530 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 1,618,313 $ 1,405,297 $ 995,117 The increase in working capital during Fiscal 2007 versus Fiscal 2006 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys increases in earnings, partially offset by capital expenditures for expansion, share repurchases and dividends paid. The increase in working capital in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the increase in the Companys net income and decreases in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses. Additionally, the Company did not make any share repurchases in Fiscal 2006 compared to $103.3 million of repurchases made in Fiscal 2005. The Company considers the following to be measures of its liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: 2007 2006 2005 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.10 2.14 1.93 Net cash provided by operating activities (thousands) $ 817,825 $ 582,171 * $ 453,590 * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. 39 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary source of liquidity, increased to $817.8 million for Fiscal 2007 from $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006. In Fiscal 2007, cash was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and amortization of deferred lease credits, collection of lessor construction allowances and decreases in inventory. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of a decrease in income taxes payable. Cash in Fiscal 2006 was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for non cash items including, depreciation and amortization and share based compensation charges, and lessor construction allowances collected. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $582.2 million for Fiscal 2006 from $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash in Fiscal 2005 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation charges, collection of lessor construction allowances and an increase in income taxes payable. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of increases in inventory. The Companys operations are seasonal and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters as the Company builds inventory in anticipation of these selling periods. Investing Activities Cash outflows for Fiscal 2007 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures related primarily to new store construction, store remodels and refreshes, the purchase of an airplane and other various store, home office and DC projects, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. Cash outflows for Fiscal 2006 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities, the purchase of trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures. Cash outflows for Fiscal 2005 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Financing Activities Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of the Companys Common Stock and the payment of dividends in Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2005. In Fiscal 2006, cash outflows for financing activities related primarily to the payment of dividends and a change in outstanding checks. Cash inflows in Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances. AF repurchased approximately 3.6 million and 1.8 million shares of AFs Common Stock during Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. AF did not repurchase any shares of AFs Common Stock during Fiscal 2006. Both the Fiscal 2007 and the Fiscal 2005 repurchases were pursuant to AF Board of Directors authorizations. In August 2005, the AF Board of Directors authorized AF to repurchase 6.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock. In November 2007, the AF Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock, in addition to the approximately 2.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock which then remained available under the August 2005 repurchase authorization. 40 Table of Contents As of February 2, 2008, AF had approximately 12.0 million shares remaining available to repurchase under the 6.0 million share authorization by the AF Board of Directors in August 2005 and the 10.0 million share authorization by the Board of Directors in November 2007. Subsequent to February 2, 2008, AF repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of AFs Common Stock with a value of approximately $50.0 million from the approximately 12.0 million shares of Common Stock remaining authorized for repurchase at February 2, 2008. On December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement) with Abercrombie Fitch Management Co., as borrower, and with AF and its other domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors. The primary purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement are for financial support of trade and stand by letters of credit and working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including an option where interest rates are based on the agent banks Alternate Base Rate, and another using the London Interbank Offered Rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the ratio of the Companys leveraged total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for the trailing four fiscal quarter periods. The facility fees are projected to accrue at either 0.15% or 0.175% on the committed amounts per annum. The Amended Credit Agreement contains limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale leaseback transactions, significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions with third parties, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and stock repurchases) and transactions with affiliates. The Amended Credit Agreement will mature on December 15, 2009. Trade letters of credit totaling approximately $61.6 million and $48.8 million were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 2, 2008 or on February 3, 2007. Standby letters of credit totaling approximately $14.5 million and $4.9 million were outstanding on February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. The standby letters of credit are set to expire during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements or debt obligations. 41 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of February 2, 2008, the Companys contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period (thousands) More than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Operating Lease Obligations $ 2,173,795 $ 254,456 $ 515,928 $ 449,994 $ 953,417 Purchase Obligations 245,599 245,599 Other Obligations 115,044 90,943 24,075 26 Totals $ 2,534,438 $ 590,998 $ 540,003 $ 450,020 $ 953,417 Operating lease obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases. See Note 7, Leased Facilities and Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for further discussion. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance (CAM), insurance, marketing or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. Total expense related to CAM, insurance, marketing and taxes was $129.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The obligations in the table above do not include unrecognized tax benefits at February 2, 2008 of $38.9 million. Additionally, the obligations in the table above do not include retirement benefits for the Companys Chief Executive Officer at February 2, 2008 of $14.0 million due under the Chief Executive Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP). See Note 12, Retirement Benefits, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the description of the SERP in the text under the caption EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION in AFs definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June 11, 2008, incorporated by reference in ITEM 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The purchase obligations category represents purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Spring 2008 and commitments for fabric to be used during upcoming seasons. Other obligations primarily represent letters of credit outstanding as of February 2, 2008, lease deposits and preventive maintenance and information technology contracts for Fiscal 2008. See Note 11, Long Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company expects to fund all of these obligations with cash provided from operations. 42 Table of Contents STORES AND GROSS SQUARE FEET Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the thirteen weeks ended February 2, 2008 and the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2007 respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Gilly Hicks Total November 3, 2007 362 198 434 20 1,014 New 2 4 17 2 3 28 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (3 ) (1 ) (4 ) Closed (2 ) (1 ) (3 ) February 2, 2008 359 201 450 22 3 1,035 Gross Square Feet (thousands) November 3, 2007 3,197 900 2,906 185 7,188 New 17 21 116 19 34 207 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (29 ) (4 ) (33 ) Closed (18 ) (7 ) (25 ) February 2, 2008 3,167 917 3,015 204 34 7,337 Average Store Size 8,822 4,562 6,700 9,273 11,333 7,089 Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Gilly Hicks Total October 28, 2006 358 171 372 11 912 New 3 8 21 4 36 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 1 (1 ) (1) Closed (2 ) (2 ) (4 ) February 3, 2007 360 177 393 14 944 Gross Square Feet (thousands) October 28, 2006 3,138 753 2,450 100 6,441 New 29 41 152 39 261 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 19 2 (9 ) (1) 12 Closed (15 ) (6 ) (21 ) February 3, 2007 3,171 788 2,604 130 6,693 Average Store Size 8,808 4,452 6,626 9,286 7,090 (1) Includes one RUEHL store temporarily closed due to fire damage. 43 Table of Contents Store count and gross square footage by brand were as follows for the fifty two weeks ended February 2, 2008 and the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007, respectively: Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Gilly Hicks Total February 3, 2007 360 177 393 14 944 New 6 25 58 7 3 99 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (2 ) (1 ) 1 (2) (2 ) Closed (5 ) (1 ) (6 ) February 2, 2008 359 201 450 22 3 1,035 Gross Square Feet (thousands) February 3, 2007 3,171 788 2,604 130 6,693 New 64 126 418 65 34 707 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (23 ) 3 9 (11 ) Closed (45 ) (7 ) (52 ) February 2, 2008 3,167 917 3,015 204 34 7,337 Average Store Size 8,822 4,562 6,700 9,273 11,333 7,089 Store Activity Abercrombie Fitch abercrombie Hollister RUEHL Gilly Hicks Total January 29, 2006 361 164 318 8 851 New 8 19 70 7 104 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) (2 ) (1) 5 (1) (1 )(2) 2 Closed (7 ) (6 ) (13 ) February 3, 2007 360 177 393 14 944 Gross Square Feet (thousands) January 29, 2006 3,157 716 2,083 69 6,025 New 66 94 482 70 712 Remodels/Conversions (net activity) 3 (1) 39 (1) (9 ) (2) 33 Closed (55 ) (22 ) (77 ) February 3, 2007 3,171 788 2,604 130 6,693 Average Store Size 8,808 4,452 6,626 9,286 7,090 (1) Includes one Abercrombie Fitch store and one Hollister store reopened after repair from hurricane damage.

In Fiscal 2007, total capital expenditures were $403.3 million, of which $252.8 million was used for store related projects related to new construction and remodels, conversions and refreshes of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $150.5 million was used for projects at the home office and the distribution centers, including home office expansion, information technology investments, the purchase of an airplane and other projects. In Fiscal 2006, total capital expenditures were $403.5 million, of which $253.7 million was used for store related projects related to new store construction and remodels, conversions, and refreshes of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $149.8 million was used for projects at the home office, including the completion of the second DC, home office expansion, information technology investments and other projects. In Fiscal 2005, total capital expenditures were $256.4 million, of which $204.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction and remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $51.7 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store locations. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $43.4 million, $49.4 million and $42.3 million in construction allowances during Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. During Fiscal 2008, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between approximately $420 million and $425 million. Approximately $300 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels, including $55 million allocated for the Hollister flagship in the SoHo area of New York City, the Abercrombie Fitch flagships in Europe and Japan and the four new Hollister mall based U.K. stores. Approximately $50 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refreshes will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, Hollister store refreshes will include the addition of video walls and the refitting of lighting and shelving to accommodate the rollout of the personal care product line. The Company is planning approximately $73 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to information technology investments, new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems and other home office projects. The Company intends to add approximately 760,000 gross square feet of stores during Fiscal 2008, which will represent an increase of approximately 10% over Fiscal 2007. The Company anticipates the increase during Fiscal 2008 will be primarily due to the addition of approximately 70 new Hollister stores, 16 new abercrombie stores, three new Abercrombie Fitch stores, six new RUEHL stores and 15 new Gilly Hicks stores. 45 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2008, the Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for non flagship Abercrombie Fitch stores to remain flat compared to Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $140; for new abercrombie stores to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $171 to approximately $148; for new Hollister stores to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $131 to approximately $126; and for RUEHL to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of $267 to $257. The changes from Fiscal 2007s estimates for Hollister, abercrombie and RUEHL stores were driven by a number of factors, including landlord allowance levels and lower construction costs. The Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new Gilly Hicks stores to be approximately $392 in Fiscal 2008. The Company expects initial inventory purchases for the stores to average approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million, $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million per store for Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister, RUEHL and Gilly Hicks, respectively. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its Amended Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Direct to consumer sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping and handling costs are classified as stores and distribution expense. Associate discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The sales return reserve was $10.7 million, $8.9 million and $8.2 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. The Companys gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. The liability remains on the Companys books until the earlier of redemption (recognized as revenue) or when the Company determines the likelihood of redemption is remote (recognized as other operating income). The Company determines the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns and recognizes the remaining balance as other operating income. At February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, the gift card liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets were $68.8 million and $65.0 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents The Company is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the states in which it operates. During Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized other operating income for adjustments to the gift card liability of $10.9 million, $5.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method. The Company determines market value as the anticipated future selling price of the merchandise less a normal margin. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. At first and third fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory. At second and fourth fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future selling price decreases necessary to sell through any remaining carryover inventory from the season just passed. The markdown reserve was $5.4 million, $6.8 million and $10.0 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrink estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. The shrink reserve was $11.5 million, $7.7 million and $3.8 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. An increase or decrease in the inventory shrink estimate of 10% would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Management believes this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings; the lesser of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to 15 years, or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements; the lesser of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years, or the term of the lease when applicable for information technology; and three to 20 years for other property and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the net operating loss of a foreign subsidiary. No other valuation allowances have been provided for deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various tax jurisdictions. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. The provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the quarter. The Company records tax expense or benefit that does not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which it occurs pursuant to the requirements of APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting and FIN 18, Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 28. Examples of such types of discrete items include, but are not limited to, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, provision to return adjustments, tax exempt income and the settlement of tax audits. Foreign Currency Translation The majority of the Companys international operations use local currencies as the functional currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars (the reporting currency) at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations; whereas, translation adjustments are reported as an element of other comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. 48 Table of Contents Equity Compensation Expense Prior to January 29, 2006, the Company reported share based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No.123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, but elected to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for which no expense was recognized for stock options if the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant, and provided the required pro forma disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 123, as amended. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) which requires stock options to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. The Companys equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants, which requires the Company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the expected term. Estimates of the expected term, which represents the expected period of time the Company believes the stock options will be outstanding, are based on historical information. Estimates of the expected future stock price volatility are based on the volatility of AFs Common Stock for the most recent historical period equal to the expected term of the stock option. The Company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for stock splits. The fair value calculation under the Black Scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the expected term and volatility assumptions. Increases in expected term or volatility will result in a higher fair valuation of stock option grants. Assuming all other assumptions disclosed in Note 4, Share Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K being equal, a 10% increase in term will yield a 5% increase in the Black Scholes valuation, while a 10% increase in volatility will yield a 7% increase in the Black Scholes valuation. The Company believes that changes in expected term and volatility would not have a material effect on the Companys results since the number of stock options granted during the periods presented was not material. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB released SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under GAAP and also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 1 that eliminates SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 2 that partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis. Consequently, SFAS No. 157 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2008, for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and will be effective on February 1, 2009, for non recurring non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 and the related FSPs on the consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 49 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB released SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that select different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 159. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments, primarily money market accounts, with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in investment grade auction rate securities (ARS), all classified as available for sale that have maturities ranging from eight to 34 years. As of February 2, 2008, the Company held approximately $530.5 million in ARS classified as marketable securities. Approximately $272.1 million of these securities were invested in closed end municipal bond funds and approximately $258.4 million were invested in securities issued by state agencies which issue student loans. Despite the underlying long term maturity of ARS, such securities were priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates reset through a Dutch auction process at predetermined periods ranging from seven to 35 days. If there are insufficient buyers, the auction is said to fail and the holders are unable to liquidate the investments through auction. A failed auction does not result in a default of the debt instrument. The securities will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. On February 13, 2008, the Company began to experience failed auctions on some of its ARS. As of March 27, 2008, the Company held approximately $365.9 million in ARS, of which $326.9 million were also held as of February 2, 2008. As of February 2, 2008, approximately 99% of the Companys ARS were AAA rated by one or more major credit rating agencies. The ratings take into account insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest. Each investment in student loans is substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Company does not believe that failures in the auction market will have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. The Company believes that it currently has adequate working capital to fund operations based on access to cash and cash equivalents and expected operating cash flows. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. The current market for the ARS is uncertain and the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the market. If auctions continue to fail, it may be necessary to reflect the securities as long term investments on its consolidated balance sheet for the period ending May 3, 2008 or thereafter. If the Company sells any of the ARS, prior to maturity, at an amount below original purchase value, or if it becomes probable that the Company will not receive 100% of the principal and interest from the issuer as to any of the ARS, the Company will be required to recognize an other than temporary impairment charge against net income. The Company established an irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust) during the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the purpose of which is to be a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants in the Abercrombie Fitch Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Chief Executive Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. As of February 2, 2008, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were $51.3 million, which included $18.6 million of available for sale municipal notes and bonds, trust owned life insurance policies with a cash surrender value of $31.3 million and $1.4 million held in money market accounts. As of February 3, 2007, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were $33.5 million, which included $18.3 million of available for sale municipal notes and bonds and trust owned life insurance policies with a cash surrender value of $15.3 million. The Rabbi Trust assets are consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 97 14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Agreements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested (EITF 97 14) and recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are restricted as to their use as noted above. There were $0.4 million in realized losses for the fifty two weeks ended February 2, 2008 and no realized gains or losses for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007, all related to available for sale securities. Net unrealized gains were approximately $.01 million as of February 2, 2008 and net unrealized losses were approximately $0.7 million as of February 3, 2007, all related to available for sale securities. 51 Table of Contents The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company has exposure to changes in currency exchange rates associated with foreign currency transactions, including inter company transactions. Such foreign currency transactions are denominated in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, Danish Krones, Swiss Francs and British Pounds. The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in foreign currency exposures are partially offset by gains or losses on forward contracts, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The Company does not use forward contracts to engage in currency speculation. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of each fiscal period. The Companys ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency fluctuations will depend on the foreign currency exchange rate changes and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. 52 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 2, 2008 are compared to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007. For Fiscal 2007, comparable store sales compare the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 2, 2008 to the thirteen and fifty two week periods ended February 3, 2007. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales compare the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 3, 2007 to the fourteen and fifty three week periods ended February 4, 2006. The Company had net sales of $3.750 billion for the fifty two weeks ended February 2, 2008, up 13.0% from $3.318 billion for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007. Operating income for Fiscal 2007 increased 12.5% to $740.5 million from $658.1 million for Fiscal 2006. Net income was $475.7 million in Fiscal 2007, up 12.7% from $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $5.20 for Fiscal 2007 compared to $4.59 in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 13.3%. The Company generated cash from operations of $817.8 million in Fiscal 2007 versus $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006, resulting primarily from a reduction in inventory and sales and earnings growth. During Fiscal 2007, the Company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy, including the opening of 58 new Hollister stores, 25 new abercrombie stores, seven new RUEHL stores, six new Abercrombie Fitch stores and three new Gilly Hicks stores, as well as the remodeling, converting or refreshing of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister and RUEHL stores. The Company also used excess cash in Fiscal 2007 to pay dividends of $0.70 per share, for a total of $61.3 million and to repurchase approximately 3.6 million shares of AF Common Stock with a value of approximately $287.9 million. The Company believes that share repurchases and dividends are an important way for the Company to deliver shareholder value, but the Companys priority will be to invest in the business to support its domestic and international growth plans. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support daily operations, fund growth initiatives and provide a degree of protection against unanticipated business volatility. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. 26 Table of Contents The following data represents the Companys Consolidated Statements of Net Income for the last three fiscal years, expressed as a percentage of net sales: 2007 2006* 2005 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Goods Sold 33.0 33.4 33.5 GROSS PROFIT 67.0 66.6 66.5 Stores and Distribution Expense 37.0 35.8 35.9 Marketing, General and Administrative Expense 10.6 11.3 11.3 Other Operating Income, Net (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.2 ) OPERATING INCOME 19.7 19.8 19.5 Interest Income, Net (0.5 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 20.2 20.3 19.7 Provision for Income Taxes 7.6 7.5 7.7 NET INCOME 12.7 % 12.7 % 12.0 % * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. 27 Table of Contents FINANCIAL SUMMARY The following summarized financial and operational data compares Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005: Change 2007 2006* 2005 2007 2006 2006 2005 Net sales by brand (thousands) $ 3,749,847 $ 3,318,158 $ 2,784,711 13 % 19 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 1,638,929 $ 1,515,123 $ 1,424,013 8 % 6 % abercrombie $ 471,045 $ 405,820 $ 344,938 16 % 18 % Hollister $ 1,589,452 $ 1,363,233 $ 999,212 17 % 36 % RUEHL $ 50,191 $ 33,982 $ 16,548 48 % 105 % Gilly Hicks*** $ 230 n/a n/a n/a n/a Increase (decrease) in comparable store sales** (1 )% 2 % 26 % Abercrombie Fitch 0 % (4 )% 18 % abercrombie 0 % 10 % 54 % Hollister (2 )% 5 % 29 % RUEHL (9 )% 14 % n/a Net retail sales increase attributable to new and remodeled stores, web sites and catalogue 14 % 17 % 12 % Net retail sales per average store (thousands) $ 3,470 $ 3,533 $ 3,284 (2 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 4,073 $ 3,945 $ 3,784 3 % 4 % abercrombie $ 2,230 $ 2,251 $ 1,957 (1 )% 15 % Hollister $ 3,550 $ 3,732 $ 3,442 (5 )% 8 % RUEHL $ 2,602 $ 3,248 $ 2,903 (20 )% 12 % Net retail sales per average gross square foot $ 489 $ 500 $ 464 (2 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch $ 463 $ 450 $ 432 3 % 4 % abercrombie $ 493 $ 513 $ 446 (4 )% 15 % Hollister $ 531 $ 568 $ 528 (7 )% 7 % RUEHL $ 282 $ 363 $ 315 (22 )% 15 % Transactions per average retail store 53,152 55,142 50,863 (4 )% 8 % Abercrombie Fitch 49,915 51,704 49,685 (3 )% 4 % abercrombie 33,907 34,786 30,356 (3 )% 15 % Hollister 65,564 68,740 64,913 (5 )% 6 % RUEHL 31,880 38,554 26,215 (17 )% 47 % Average retail transaction value $ 65.29 $ 64.07 $ 64.56 2 % (1 )% Abercrombie Fitch $ 81.59 $ 76.30 $ 76.16 7 % 0 % abercrombie $ 65.76 $ 64.72 $ 64.47 2 % 0 % Hollister $ 54.15 $ 54.30 $ 53.03 0 % 2 % RUEHL $ 81.61 $ 84.24 $ 110.74 (3 )% (24 )% Average units per retail transaction 2.42 2.35 2.25 3 % 4 % Abercrombie Fitch 2.37 2.26 2.18 5 % 4 % abercrombie 2.82 2.78 2.66 1 % 5 % Hollister 2.36 2.32 2.21 2 % 5 % RUEHL 2.48 2.57 2.28 (4 )% 13 % Average unit retail sold $ 26.98 $ 27.26 $ 28.69 (1 )% (5 )% Abercrombie Fitch $ 34.43 $ 33.76 $ 34.94 2 % (3 )% abercrombie $ 23.32 $ 23.28 $ 24.24 0 % (4 )% Hollister $ 22.94 $ 23.41 $ 24.00 (2 )% (2 )% RUEHL $ 32.91 $ 32.78 $ 48.57 0 % (33 )% * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. ** A store is included in comparable store sales when it has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.

The Company maintained high store sales productivity and a high operating margin, even as the Company continued to invest in the long term positioning of its brands. The Company believes its ability to maintain the sale of full priced merchandise and consistent high store sales productivity is a result of its commitment to offer trend right merchandise, with the highest level of quality, and to create an exceptional in store experience, which establishes an emotional connection with its customers. The Companys commitment to its brands is demonstrated by strategic investments made in the areas of stores, merchandise development and home office infrastructure, which the Company believes will enhance quality, improve productivity and support future growth. Specifically, major implementations in planning, merchandising and allocation information systems over the next year should generate supply chain improvements and serve as a platform for future growth and expansion, both domestically and internationally. The Company believes it has significant growth potential both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the Company believes its growth potential will come from proven brands like Hollister and developing concepts like Gilly Hicks. Internationally, the Company believes its growth will come from its Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister brands. Recent international performance highlights the opportunity for expansion. In Fiscal 2007, the three Abercrombie Fitch and three Hollister stores located in Canada continued to generate more than three times the sales productivity of the average U.S. counterpart and the Abercrombie Fitch London flagship generated substantial sales per selling square foot similar to the strong performance of the Fifth Avenue flagship. Tourist stores, such as Fifth Avenue in New York, Ala Moana in Hawaii and Aventura Mall in Miami, are among the top performing stores in the chain. Additionally, international direct to consumer sales increased 72.4% from Fiscal 2006. In 2008, the Company plans to open one Abercrombie Fitch store, three abercrombie stores and three Hollister stores in Canada. The Company also plans to enter the U.K. market with Hollister with the opening of four shopping center based stores in 2008. The first store is scheduled to open in October at Brent Cross Shopping Centre, outside of London. Construction is currently underway for the first Hollister flagship in the SoHo area of New York City. The multi level flagship is scheduled to open in Spring 2009. The Company anticipates the Hollister flagship to fortify the iconic status of the brand in order to support its international growth. Construction is also currently underway for the Abercrombie Fitch flagship in Tokyos Ginza district, with a planned opening in late 2009. Opportunities are also being assessed for the Abercrombie Fitch and Hollister brands in continental Europe and other sites in Japan. In addition to a focus on the domestic and international expansion of existing iconic brands, the Company also views new concepts as an integral part of its long term strategy. In January 2008, the Company launched its fifth concept, Gilly Hicks. This concept provides the opportunity to expand the existing emotional connection with the Companys female customers by offering bras, underwear, personal care products, sleepwear and at home products. The Company operated three Gilly Hicks stores at the end of Fiscal 2007 and plans to open 15 stores in Fiscal 2008. 29 Table of Contents Although profitability was not achieved as originally expected, RUEHL made significant progress in Fiscal 2007 with improvements to gross margin and reductions in store operating and store construction costs. In Fiscal 2008, the Company will continue to focus on improving the quality level of the merchandise in order to be consistent with the brands positioning and pricing strategy. The Company expects brand awareness to grow from the RUEHL website which has offered a full product assortment since January 2008. However, the Company will moderate the pace of new store openings until RUEHL can be established as a proven concept. The Company also views product line expansion through its existing brands as another promising growth opportunity. In October 2007, the Company launched a body care line in 93 Hollister stores for both Dudes and Bettys. Holiday purchases of body care products were primarily incremental transaction units indicating the product line is a way to help fuel organic sales growth. As a result, the Company has decided to expand the body care products to all Hollister stores in Fiscal 2008. The Company is in the midst of an investment and expansion phase targeted at driving consistent and sustainable long term value growth. The Company believes strongly in its brands and in the potential for its international expansion plan, and will continue to invest during economic cycles. If the current general macro economic downturn persists and negatively impacts sales, the Companys cost structure will be aligned accordingly, but resource cuts that could jeopardize the ability to implement the Companys long term growth initiatives will be avoided. 30 Table of Contents The following measurements are among the key business indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Companys results: Comparable store sales by brand, by product and by store, defined as year over year sales for a store that has been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year; Direct to consumer sales growth; International and flagship stores performance; New store productivity; IMU; Selling margin, defined as sales price less original cost, by brand and by product category; Stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales; Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales; Store metrics such as sales per gross square foot, sales per selling square foot, average unit retail, average number of transactions per store, average transaction values, store contribution (defined as store sales less direct costs of running the store), and average units per transaction; Markdown rate; Gross profit rate; Operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales; Net income; Inventory per gross square foot; and Cash flow and liquidity determined by the Companys current ratio and cash provided by operations. While not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company due to the proprietary nature of the information, the Company publicly discloses and discusses several of these metrics as part of its financial summary and in several sections within the Managements Discussion and Analysis. 31 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Fourth quarter net sales for the thirteen week period ended February 2, 2008 were $1.229 billion, up 7.9% versus net sales of $1.139 billion for the fourteen week period ended February 3, 2007. The net sales increase was attributed primarily to the net addition of 91 stores and a 46.8% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue), partially offset by an extra selling week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 and the resulting impact of the calendar shift in Fiscal 2007 due to Fiscal 2006 being a 53 week fiscal year, as well as a 1% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch increased 1% with mens comparable store sales increasing by a low double digit and womens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie decreased 3% with boys increasing by a mid single digit and girls decreasing by a mid single digit; Hollister decreased 2% with dudes increasing by a high single digit and bettys decreasing by a mid single digit; and RUEHL decreased 19% with mens decreasing by a high single digit and womens decreasing by the high twenties. Comparable regional store sales ranged from increases in the high teens to decreases in the mid single digits. Stores located in Canada and the Southwest and North Atlantic regions had the strongest comparable store sales performance, while stores located in the South, Midwest and West regions had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included graphic tees, fragrance and fleece, while pants, jeans and knits posted negative comparable sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included graphics tees, jeans and sweaters, while knits and fleece posted negative comparable sales. Direct to consumer net merchandise sales, which are sold through the Companys websites and catalogue in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, were $108.6 million, an increase of 45.2% versus last years fourth quarter net merchandise sales of $74.8 million. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 10.1% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 compared to 7.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by store expansion, both domestically and internationally, improved in stock inventory availability, an improved targeted e mail marketing strategy and improved website functionality. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $825.6 million compared to $755.6 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The gross profit rate (gross profit divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 67.2%, up 80 basis points from last years fourth quarter rate of 66.4%. The increase in gross profit rate can be attributed to both a higher IMU rate and a lower shrink rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, partially offset by a higher markdown rate. 32 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $388.4 million compared to $349.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The stores and distribution expense rate (stores and distribution expense divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 31.6%, up 90 basis points from 30.7% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The increase in rate is primarily related to the impact of minimum wage and management salary increases and higher store fixed cost rates. The DC productivity level, measured in units processed per labor hour (UPH), was 16.1% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, reflecting the realization of increased efficiencies due to the second DC being operational during Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $103.2 million compared to $101.6 million during the same period in Fiscal 2006. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate (marketing, general and administrative expense divided by net sales) was 8.4% compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The decrease in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was a result of lower travel, samples and outside service expense rates, partially offset by an increase in the home office payroll expense rate. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2007 was $3.0 million compared to $4.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The decrease was driven primarily by losses on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 as compared to gains on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 increased to $337.1 million from $308.8 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 9.2%. The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 27.4% compared to 27.1% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $6.4 million in Fiscal 2007 compared to $4.7 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was 36.9% as compared to 36.8% for the Fiscal 2006 comparable period. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $216.8 million versus $198.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, an increase of 9.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 was $2.40, versus $2.14 for the Fiscal 2006 comparable period, an increase of 12.2%. 33 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2007 were $3.750 billion, an increase of 13.0% versus Fiscal 2006 net sales of $3.318 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 91 stores and a 50% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue), partially offset by a 1% comparable store sales decrease and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2007. For Fiscal 2007, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie comparable sales were flat; Hollister decreased 2%; and RUEHL decreased 9%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. During Fiscal 2007, womens, girls and bettys represented at least 60% of the net sales for each of their corresponding brands. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2007 were $258.9 million, an increase of 49% versus Fiscal 2006 net merchandise sales of $174.1 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $39.1 million in Fiscal 2007 and $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 8.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2007 compared to 6.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by store expansion, both domestically and internationally, improved in stock inventory availability, an improved targeted e mail marketing strategy and improved website functionality. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2007, gross profit increased to $2.511 billion from $2.209 billion in Fiscal 2006. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2007 was 67.0% versus 66.6% the previous year, an increase of 40 basis points. The increase in the gross profit rate was driven primarily by a higher IMU rate and a lower shrink rate in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, partially offset by a higher markdown rate. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2007 was $1.387 billion compared to $1.187 billion for Fiscal 2006. For Fiscal 2007, the stores and distribution expense rate was 37.0% compared to 35.8% in the previous year. The increase in rate resulted primarily from store payroll, including minimum wage and store manager salary increases, higher store fixed cost rates and store packaging and supply expenses. The DCs UPH rate for Fiscal 2007 increased 9.1% as compared to Fiscal 2006, reflecting the realization of efficiencies obtained during Fiscal 2007 due to the second DC being operational. The Company expects the overall UPH level to continue to improve during Fiscal 2008, however at a lower rate than Fiscal 2007. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2007 was $395.8 million compared to $373.8 million in Fiscal 2006. For the current year, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 10.6%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared to last years rate of 11.3%. The decrease in rate resulted from reductions in travel, samples and outside services expense rates, partially offset by the increase in payroll expense rate. 34 Table of Contents Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2007 was $11.7 million compared to $10.0 million for Fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote, partially offset by decreases in gains related to foreign currency transactions. The comparable year to date period in Fiscal 2006 included other operating income related to insurance reimbursements for a fire damaged store and a store damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Operating Income Fiscal 2007 operating income was $740.5 million compared to $658.1 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of 12.5%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2007 was 19.7% versus 19.8% in the previous year. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2007 was $18.8 million compared to $13.9 million for Fiscal 2006. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2007 was 37.4% compared to 37.2% for Fiscal 2006. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2007 was $475.7 million versus $422.2 million in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 12.7%. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $5.20 in Fiscal 2007 versus $4.59 in Fiscal 2006, an increase of 13.3%. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $1.139 billion, up 18.5% versus net sales of $961.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The net sales increase was attributed primarily to the net addition of 93 stores, including the full quarter impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue flagship and six stores in Canada; a 58% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fourteen week quarter in Fiscal 2006 versus a thirteen week quarter in Fiscal 2005, partially offset by a 3% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales by brand for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 6% with womens comparable store sales decreasing by a high single digit and mens decreasing by a mid single digit; abercrombie increased 2% with boys achieving a mid single digit increase and girls flat; Hollister was flat with bettys flat and dudes posting a decrease in the low single digits; and RUEHL increased 6% with womens realizing a mid single digit increase and mens posting a low single digit increase. On a regional basis, comparable store sales for the Company ranged from decreases in the high single digits to increases in the low single digits. Stores located in the North Atlantic region had the strongest comparable store sales performance and stores located in the West region had the weakest comparable store sales performance on a consolidated basis. 35 Table of Contents From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands, stronger performing masculine categories included fleece, knit tops and underwear, while jeans, pants and sweaters posted negative comparable store sales. In the feminine businesses, across all brands, stronger performing categories included knit tops, fleece and shorts, while jeans, skirts and pants posted negative comparable store sales. Direct to consumer net merchandise sales, sold through the Companys websites and catalogue, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 were $74.8 million, an increase of 57.5% versus net merchandise sales of $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Shipping and handling revenue for the corresponding periods was $9.8 million in Fiscal 2006 and $6.2 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 7.4% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.6% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $755.6 million compared to $639.4 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 66.4%, down 10 basis points from the Fiscal 2005 fourth quarter rate of 66.5%. The decrease in gross profit rate largely resulted from a higher shrink rate and a slightly higher markdown rate compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister all operated at similar IMU levels. Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $349.8 million compared to $293.5 million for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The stores and distribution expense rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 30.7%, up 20 basis points from 30.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in rate is primarily related to additional DC expenses associated with the second DC, which became fully operational in the fourth quarter, and direct to consumer expenses, which increased due to higher internet sales as a percentage of total sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased store expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling payroll, driven by management salary increases, state minimum wage increases and additional floor coverage to address shrink concerns increased as a percentage of sales. However, the increase in selling payroll was more than offset by leveraging other store related controllable expenses. The DC productivity level, measured in UPH, was 9% higher in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The UPH rate increase was due to the second DC becoming fully operational during the fourth quarter. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $101.6 million compared to $80.8 million during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 8.9% compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The increase in the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was due to higher home office payroll and consulting expenses. Other Operating Income, Net Fourth quarter net other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $4.6 million compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Other operating income related primarily to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 increased to $308.8 million from $267.5 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 15.4%. The operating income rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 27.1% compared to 27.8% for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Fourth quarter net interest income was $4.7 million in Fiscal 2006 compared to $2.4 million during the comparable period in Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 when compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was 36.8% as compared to 39.0% for the Fiscal 2005 comparable period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was related primarily to favorable settlements of tax audits during the fourth quarter and the change in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $198.2 million versus $164.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, an increase of 20.4%. Net income per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $2.14, including $0.01 related to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), versus $1.80 for the comparable period in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 18.9%. FISCAL 2006 RESULTS Net Sales Net sales for Fiscal 2006 were $3.318 billion, an increase of 19.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net sales of $2.785 billion. The net sales increase was attributed to the combination of the net addition of 93 stores, including the full year impact of the Abercrombie Fitch Fifth Avenue flagship and six stores in Canada; a 2% comparable store sales increase; a 42% increase in direct to consumer business (including shipping and handling revenue); and a fifty three week year in Fiscal 2006 versus a fifty two week year in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, comparable store sales by brand were as follows: Abercrombie Fitch decreased 4%; abercrombie increased 10%; Hollister increased 5%; and RUEHL increased 14%. In addition, the womens, girls and bettys businesses continued to be more significant than the mens, boys and dudes. Direct to consumer merchandise net sales in Fiscal 2006 were $174.1 million, an increase of 42.1% versus Fiscal 2005 net merchandise sales of $122.5 million. Shipping and handling revenue was $24.9 million in Fiscal 2006 and $17.6 million in Fiscal 2005. The direct to consumer business, including shipping and handling revenue, accounted for 6.0% of total net sales in Fiscal 2006 compared to 5.0% of net total sales in Fiscal 2005. Gross Profit For Fiscal 2006, gross profit increased to $2.209 billion from $1.851 billion in Fiscal 2005. The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2006 was 66.6% versus 66.5% for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 10 basis points. 37 Table of Contents Stores and Distribution Expense Stores and distribution expense for Fiscal 2006 was $1.187 billion compared to $1.001 billion for Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the stores and distribution expense rate was 35.8% compared to 35.9% in Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the rate resulted primarily from the Companys ability to leverage store related costs on a 2% increase in comparable store sales. The DCs UPH rate for the year was flat in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2006, while the second DC was being built, the overall DCs UPH was impacted by the Companys first DC reaching near capacity, a result of the Companys focus on strategically flowing inventory to stores during Fiscal 2006. Marketing, General and Administrative Expense Marketing, general and administrative expense during Fiscal 2006 was $373.8 million compared to $313.5 million in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2006, the marketing, general and administrative expense rate was 11.3%, which was flat compared to Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included a charge of $13.6 million related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Fiscal 2005 included a non recurring charge of $13.5 million related to a severance agreement with an executive officer. Other Operating Income, Net Other operating income for Fiscal 2006 was $10.0 million compared to $5.5 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase was related to gift cards for which the Company has determined the likelihood of redemption to be remote and insurance reimbursements received during the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2006 related to stores damaged by fire and Hurricane Katrina, respectively. Operating Income Fiscal 2006 operating income was $658.1 million compared to $542.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of 21.3%. The operating income rate for Fiscal 2006 was 19.8% versus 19.5% in Fiscal 2005. Interest Income, Net and Income Taxes Net interest income for Fiscal 2006 was $13.9 million compared to $6.7 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was due to higher interest rates and higher available investment balances during Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2006 was 37.2% compared to 39.2% for Fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate primarily related to favorable settlements of tax audits, favorable changes in estimates of potential outcomes of certain state tax matters and an increase in tax exempt income during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 tax expense reflected a charge related to the Companys change in estimate of the potential outcome of certain state tax matters. Net Income and Net Income per Share Net income for Fiscal 2006 was $422.2 million versus $334.0 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 26.4%. Net income included after tax charges of $9.9 million in Fiscal 2006 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), and non recurring charges of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2005 related to a severance agreement with an executive officer. Net income per diluted weighted average share was $4.59 in Fiscal 2006 versus $3.66 in Fiscal 2005, an increase of 25.4%. 38 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Continued growth in net income and decreases in inventory resulted in increased cash provided by operating activities. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and capital requirements follows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company expects that substantially all future operations, including projected growth, seasonal requirements and capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. Furthermore, the Company expects that cash from operating activities will fund dividends currently being paid at a rate of $0.175 per share per quarter. The Board of Directors of AF will review the Companys cash position and results of operations and address the appropriateness of future dividend amounts. A summary of the Companys working capital (current assets less current liabilities) position and capitalization at the end of the last three fiscal years follows (thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Working capital $ 597,142 $ 581,451 $ 455,530 Capitalization: Shareholders equity $ 1,618,313 $ 1,405,297 $ 995,117 The increase in working capital during Fiscal 2007 versus Fiscal 2006 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the Companys increases in earnings, partially offset by capital expenditures for expansion, share repurchases and dividends paid. The increase in working capital in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005 was the result of higher cash and marketable securities, resulting primarily from the increase in the Companys net income and decreases in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses. Additionally, the Company did not make any share repurchases in Fiscal 2006 compared to $103.3 million of repurchases made in Fiscal 2005. The Company considers the following to be measures of its liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: 2007 2006 2005 Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 2.10 2.14 1.93 Net cash provided by operating activities (thousands) $ 817,825 $ 582,171 * $ 453,590 * Fiscal 2006 was a fifty three week year. 39 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys primary source of liquidity, increased to $817.8 million for Fiscal 2007 from $582.2 million in Fiscal 2006. In Fiscal 2007, cash was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization, share based compensation charges and amortization of deferred lease credits, collection of lessor construction allowances and decreases in inventory. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of a decrease in income taxes payable. Cash in Fiscal 2006 was provided primarily by current year net income, adjusted for non cash items including, depreciation and amortization and share based compensation charges, and lessor construction allowances collected. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of increases in inventory and a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $582.2 million for Fiscal 2006 from $453.6 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash in Fiscal 2005 was provided primarily by net income adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation charges, collection of lessor construction allowances and an increase in income taxes payable. Uses of cash in Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of increases in inventory. The Companys operations are seasonal and typically peak during the Back to School and Holiday selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for inventory expenditures are highest in the second and third fiscal quarters as the Company builds inventory in anticipation of these selling periods. Investing Activities Cash outflows for Fiscal 2007 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures related primarily to new store construction, store remodels and refreshes, the purchase of an airplane and other various store, home office and DC projects, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. Cash outflows for Fiscal 2006 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities, the purchase of trust owned life insurance policies and capital expenditures. Cash outflows for Fiscal 2005 were primarily for purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures. Financing Activities Cash outflows related to financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of the Companys Common Stock and the payment of dividends in Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2005. In Fiscal 2006, cash outflows for financing activities related primarily to the payment of dividends and a change in outstanding checks. Cash inflows in Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances.

In August 2005, the AF Board of Directors authorized AF to repurchase 6.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock. In November 2007, the AF Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock, in addition to the approximately 2.0 million shares of AFs Common Stock which then remained available under the August 2005 repurchase authorization. 40 Table of Contents As of February 2, 2008, AF had approximately 12.0 million shares remaining available to repurchase under the 6.0 million share authorization by the AF Board of Directors in August 2005 and the 10.0 million share authorization by the Board of Directors in November 2007. Subsequent to February 2, 2008, AF repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of AFs Common Stock with a value of approximately $50.0 million from the approximately 12.0 million shares of Common Stock remaining authorized for repurchase at February 2, 2008. On December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement) with Abercrombie Fitch Management Co., as borrower, and with AF and its other domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors. The primary purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement are for financial support of trade and stand by letters of credit and working capital. The Amended Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including an option where interest rates are based on the agent banks Alternate Base Rate, and another using the London Interbank Offered Rate. The facility fees payable under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on the ratio of the Companys leveraged total debt plus 600% of forward minimum rent commitments to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for the trailing four fiscal quarter periods. The facility fees are projected to accrue at either 0.15% or 0.175% on the committed amounts per annum. The Amended Credit Agreement contains limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale leaseback transactions, significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions with third parties, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and stock repurchases) and transactions with affiliates. The Amended Credit Agreement will mature on December 15, 2009. Trade letters of credit totaling approximately $61.6 million and $48.8 million were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement on February 2, 2008 or on February 3, 2007. Standby letters of credit totaling approximately $14.5 million and $4.9 million were outstanding on February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. The standby letters of credit are set to expire during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company authorizes or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit.

In Fiscal 2007, total capital expenditures were $403.3 million, of which $252.8 million was used for store related projects related to new construction and remodels, conversions and refreshes of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $150.5 million was used for projects at the home office and the distribution centers, including home office expansion, information technology investments, the purchase of an airplane and other projects. In Fiscal 2006, total capital expenditures were $403.5 million, of which $253.7 million was used for store related projects related to new store construction and remodels, conversions, and refreshes of existing Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister stores. The remaining $149.8 million was used for projects at the home office, including the completion of the second DC, home office expansion, information technology investments and other projects. In Fiscal 2005, total capital expenditures were $256.4 million, of which $204.7 million was used for store related projects, including new store construction and remodels, conversions and other projects. The remaining $51.7 million was used for projects at the home office, including home office improvements, information technology investments, DC improvements and other projects. Lessor construction allowances are an integral part of the decision making process for assessing the viability of new store locations. In making the decision whether to invest in a store location, the Company calculates the estimated future return on its investment based on the cost of construction, less any construction allowances to be received from the landlord. The Company received $43.4 million, $49.4 million and $42.3 million in construction allowances during Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. During Fiscal 2008, the Company anticipates capital expenditures between approximately $420 million and $425 million. Approximately $300 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction and full store remodels, including $55 million allocated for the Hollister flagship in the SoHo area of New York City, the Abercrombie Fitch flagships in Europe and Japan and the four new Hollister mall based U.K. stores. Approximately $50 million is expected to be allocated to refresh existing stores. The store refreshes will include new floors, sound systems and fixture replacements at Abercrombie Fitch and abercrombie stores. In addition, Hollister store refreshes will include the addition of video walls and the refitting of lighting and shelving to accommodate the rollout of the personal care product line. The Company is planning approximately $73 million in capital expenditures at the home office related to information technology investments, new direct to consumer distribution and logistics systems and other home office projects. The Company intends to add approximately 760,000 gross square feet of stores during Fiscal 2008, which will represent an increase of approximately 10% over Fiscal 2007. The Company anticipates the increase during Fiscal 2008 will be primarily due to the addition of approximately 70 new Hollister stores, 16 new abercrombie stores, three new Abercrombie Fitch stores, six new RUEHL stores and 15 new Gilly Hicks stores. 45 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2008, the Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for non flagship Abercrombie Fitch stores to remain flat compared to Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $140; for new abercrombie stores to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $171 to approximately $148; for new Hollister stores to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of approximately $131 to approximately $126; and for RUEHL to decrease from Fiscal 2007s cost of $267 to $257. The changes from Fiscal 2007s estimates for Hollister, abercrombie and RUEHL stores were driven by a number of factors, including landlord allowance levels and lower construction costs. The Company expects the average construction cost per square foot, net of construction allowances, for new Gilly Hicks stores to be approximately $392 in Fiscal 2008. The Company expects initial inventory purchases for the stores to average approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million, $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million per store for Abercrombie Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister, RUEHL and Gilly Hicks, respectively. The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its Amended Credit Agreement to support operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Direct to consumer sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping and handling costs are classified as stores and distribution expense. Associate discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The sales return reserve was $10.7 million, $8.9 million and $8.2 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. The Companys gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity. The Company accounts for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold. The liability remains on the Companys books until the earlier of redemption (recognized as revenue) or when the Company determines the likelihood of redemption is remote (recognized as other operating income). The Company determines the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns and recognizes the remaining balance as other operating income. At February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, the gift card liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets were $68.8 million and $65.0 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents The Company is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the states in which it operates. During Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized other operating income for adjustments to the gift card liability of $10.9 million, $5.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method. The Company determines market value as the anticipated future selling price of the merchandise less a normal margin. An initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship. At first and third fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory. At second and fourth fiscal quarter end, the Company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future selling price decreases necessary to sell through any remaining carryover inventory from the season just passed. The markdown reserve was $5.4 million, $6.8 million and $10.0 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an inventory shrink estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. The shrink reserve was $11.5 million, $7.7 million and $3.8 million at February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. An increase or decrease in the inventory shrink estimate of 10% would not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Management believes this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory. Property and Equipment Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis, using service lives ranging principally from 30 years for buildings; the lesser of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to 15 years, or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements; the lesser of the useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to seven years, or the term of the lease when applicable for information technology; and three to 20 years for other property and equipment. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized. Long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Companys operations. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the net operating loss of a foreign subsidiary. No other valuation allowances have been provided for deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects managements judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various tax jurisdictions. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. The provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the quarter. The Company records tax expense or benefit that does not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which it occurs pursuant to the requirements of APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting and FIN 18, Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 28. Examples of such types of discrete items include, but are not limited to, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, provision to return adjustments, tax exempt income and the settlement of tax audits. Foreign Currency Translation The majority of the Companys international operations use local currencies as the functional currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars (the reporting currency) at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations; whereas, translation adjustments are reported as an element of other comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which requires the use of managements judgment on the outcome of various issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be required. 48 Table of Contents Equity Compensation Expense Prior to January 29, 2006, the Company reported share based compensation through the disclosure only requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No.123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, but elected to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for which no expense was recognized for stock options if the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant, and provided the required pro forma disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 123, as amended. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) which requires stock options to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. The Companys equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants, which requires the Company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the expected term. Estimates of the expected term, which represents the expected period of time the Company believes the stock options will be outstanding, are based on historical information. Estimates of the expected future stock price volatility are based on the volatility of AFs Common Stock for the most recent historical period equal to the expected term of the stock option. The Company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price, adjusted for stock splits. The fair value calculation under the Black Scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the expected term and volatility assumptions. Increases in expected term or volatility will result in a higher fair valuation of stock option grants. Assuming all other assumptions disclosed in Note 4, Share Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, located in ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K being equal, a 10% increase in term will yield a 5% increase in the Black Scholes valuation, while a 10% increase in volatility will yield a 7% increase in the Black Scholes valuation. The Company believes that changes in expected term and volatility would not have a material effect on the Companys results since the number of stock options granted during the periods presented was not material. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB released SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under GAAP and also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 1 that eliminates SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 2 that partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis. Consequently, SFAS No. 157 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2008, for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis and will be effective on February 1, 2009, for non recurring non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 and the related FSPs on the consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 49 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB released SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that select different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 was effective for the Company on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 159. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments, primarily money market accounts, with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds investments in investment grade auction rate securities (ARS), all classified as available for sale that have maturities ranging from eight to 34 years. As of February 2, 2008, the Company held approximately $530.5 million in ARS classified as marketable securities. Approximately $272.1 million of these securities were invested in closed end municipal bond funds and approximately $258.4 million were invested in securities issued by state agencies which issue student loans. Despite the underlying long term maturity of ARS, such securities were priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature. Interest rates reset through a Dutch auction process at predetermined periods ranging from seven to 35 days. If there are insufficient buyers, the auction is said to fail and the holders are unable to liquidate the investments through auction. A failed auction does not result in a default of the debt instrument. The securities will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. On February 13, 2008, the Company began to experience failed auctions on some of its ARS. As of March 27, 2008, the Company held approximately $365.9 million in ARS, of which $326.9 million were also held as of February 2, 2008. As of February 2, 2008, approximately 99% of the Companys ARS were AAA rated by one or more major credit rating agencies. The ratings take into account insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest. Each investment in student loans is substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Company does not believe that failures in the auction market will have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. The Company believes that it currently has adequate working capital to fund operations based on access to cash and cash equivalents and expected operating cash flows. In addition, the Company has $250 million available, less outstanding letters of credit, under its unsecured credit agreement to support operations. The current market for the ARS is uncertain and the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the market. If auctions continue to fail, it may be necessary to reflect the securities as long term investments on its consolidated balance sheet for the period ending May 3, 2008 or thereafter. If the Company sells any of the ARS, prior to maturity, at an amount below original purchase value, or if it becomes probable that the Company will not receive 100% of the principal and interest from the issuer as to any of the ARS, the Company will be required to recognize an other than temporary impairment charge against net income. The Company established an irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust) during the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the purpose of which is to be a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants in the Abercrombie Fitch Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Chief Executive Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. As of February 2, 2008, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were $51.3 million, which included $18.6 million of available for sale municipal notes and bonds, trust owned life insurance policies with a cash surrender value of $31.3 million and $1.4 million held in money market accounts. As of February 3, 2007, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were $33.5 million, which included $18.3 million of available for sale municipal notes and bonds and trust owned life insurance policies with a cash surrender value of $15.3 million. The Rabbi Trust assets are consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 97 14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Agreements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested (EITF 97 14) and recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are restricted as to their use as noted above. There were $0.4 million in realized losses for the fifty two weeks ended February 2, 2008 and no realized gains or losses for the fifty three weeks ended February 3, 2007, all related to available for sale securities. Net unrealized gains were approximately $.01 million as of February 2, 2008 and net unrealized losses were approximately $0.7 million as of February 3, 2007, all related to available for sale securities. 51 Table of Contents The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had no long term debt outstanding. Future borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk. The Company has exposure to changes in currency exchange rates associated with foreign currency transactions, including inter company transactions. Such foreign currency transactions are denominated in Euros, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, Danish Krones, Swiss Francs and British Pounds. The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in foreign currency exposures are partially offset by gains or losses on forward contracts, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The Company does not use forward contracts to engage in currency speculation. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of each fiscal period. The Companys ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency fluctuations will depend on the foreign currency exchange rate changes and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. 52 Table of Contents
