ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In 2001, Apache turned in another record year on many operational and financial fronts, the result of our strategy of pursuing growth through a combination of drilling and acquisition activities in core areas worldwide. The results were achieved in a year marked with turmoil in the economy, financial markets and the energy industry. In January, natural gas prices neared $10 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), only to fall below $2 per Mcf in October. Although commodity prices weakened through the year, Apaches rising production profile fueled record income attributable to common stock and record cash from operating activities of $704 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. Throughout the year, we remained focused on increasing our production and building our reserves at reasonable costs. Our production grew for the 24th consecutive year, rising 32 percent, to 344,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), the largest year over year percentage increase in a decade. Our fourth quarter average daily production exceeded 362,000 boe/d, pointing to a strong start for 2002. Our strategy put in place over a decade ago to seek opportunities outside the U.S., is paying off for shareholders; for the first time in our history, over half of our equivalent production came from outside the U.S., adding to the Companys stability. Additionally, our record reserves increased for the 16th consecutive year (by 17 percent) to 1.3 billion boe. Production and reserve growth was driven by successful drilling activities in Canada and Australia, and strategic acquisitions in Canada and Egypt. Development activities at the Ladyfern field in Canada, which was discovered on acreage acquired from Shell Canada in 1999, contributed 12 percent of the company wide 14 increase in gas production. In Australia, drilling and development activity at the Legendre, Gipsy/North Gipsy and Simpson fields accounted for approximately one third of our worldwide oil production increase. Worldwide, we spent approximately $1.4 billion on exploration and development and completed over $1.2 billion of acquisitions. Our acquisitions were dominated by two transactions; the acquisition of the Fletcher Challenge Energy properties, primarily located in Canada, and the acquisition of substantially all of Repsol YPFs concession interests in Egypt. Including the related goodwill, our acquisition cost totaled $5.07 per Boe in 2001. All told, Apache spent approximately $2.6 billion on acquisitions, exploration and development, replacing 314 percent of production at a competitive all in finding and acquisition cost of $5.64 per boe, the outcome of our long term strategy to take a disciplined approach to controlling costs and growing through the most cost effective method given market conditions. Both acquisitions and drilling are important; a barrel is a barrel no matter how you obtain it. What matters are its underlying economics. Our strategy is also reflected in our balance sheet, which remained strong despite a record year of spending. We exited the year with debt (including preferred interests of subsidiaries and net of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments) at 37 percent of total capitalization, even with year end 2000. We also maintained a senior unsecured long term debt rating of A3 from Moodys, and A from the Standard and Poors and Fitch rating agencies. In September 2001, to recognize Apaches transformation to a stronger, more profitable Company, we declared a 10 percent common stock dividend paid on January 21, 2002, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. In conjunction with our stock dividend, we increased our quarterly dividend from six cents per common share to 10 cents per share. Together, these actions are expected to result in a 57 percent increase in the dividends you will receive. All of the share and per share information included in this discussion have been adjusted for the stock dividend. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Acquisitions and Divestitures In each of the past three years, Apache has made significant acquisitions that affect the comparability of our financial results. We acquired 213, 254 and 246 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) of proved reserves for approximately $0.9, $1.3 and $1.4 billion during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. In addition, the acquisitions added $197 million of goodwill and $146 million of production, processing and transportation facilities in 2001, and $94 million of such facilities in 2000. These acquisitions helped strengthen our position in our core areas and provided promising prospects for future exploration and development activities. We will continue our strategy of finding additional reserves on the acquired properties and accelerating the production of those already identified. In connection with some of these acquisitions, we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected Apache from falling commodity prices. This enabled us to better predict the financial implications of our acquisitions. These, as well as the gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers, increased the Companys average natural gas price by $.09 per Mcf during 2001 and $.05 per Mcf during 2000. They reduced our average crude oil price by $.42 per bbl during 2001 and $1.62 per bbl during 2000. Driven by the uncertainty of how the collapse of Enron Corp. would impact the derivatives markets, we closed all of these positions in October and November 2001, and recognized a net gain of $10 million. An additional $21 million net gain will be recognized over the next two years as the original hedged production occurs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio of properties and divest those that are marginal or do not strategically fit into our growth program. We divested $348, $26 and $155 million of properties during 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Revenues Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of 15 our control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while economic factors such as the current U.S. recession could impact demand. The table below presents oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.

Canadas increase was primarily driven by our acquisition of producing properties from Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) (December 2000) and Fletcher (March 2001) as well as strong exploration and development results from the Ladyfern area. A full year of production from the properties we acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) (August 2000) and Collins & Ware, Inc. (Collins & Ware) (June 2000) helped to boost our domestic production by 13 percent, while properties acquired from Repsol helped double our Egyptian production. During 2000, our natural gas revenues more than doubled. About 60 percent of this increase was the result of significantly higher natural gas prices. Recognizing the opportunities that these strong natural gas prices provided, we acquired numerous properties at reasonable prices and accelerated our drilling program. Together, these helped increase our production by 27 percent. Properties acquired from a subsidiary of Repsol (January 2000), Collins & Ware (June 2000) and Occidental (August 2000) enabled us to increase our domestic production by 18 percent. Increased developmental activities on the properties acquired from Shell Canada Limited (Shell Canada) (November 1999) added 31 percent to our Canadian production. The completion of a second pipeline in Australia helped us tap our existing capacity and increase production by 42 percent in 2000. Similarly, Egyptian gas production nearly tripled in 2000 reflecting a full year of deliveries into the northern portion of the Western Desert Gas Pipeline. We have used long term, fixed price physical contracts to lock in a portion of our domestic future natural gas production at fixed prices. These contracts represented approximately 11 and 10 percent of our 2001 and 2000 domestic natural gas production, respectively. The contracts provide protection to the Company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices. The historically high prices for natural gas during 2001 and 2000, however, resulted in losses under these contracts, negatively impacting our average realized prices by $.06 per Mcf in 2001 and $.17 per Mcf in 2000. In addition, due to the availability of long term contracts in Australia, substantially all of our Australian natural gas production is subject to fixed prices. Crude Oil Revenues Our crude oil revenues increased in 2001 despite a 16 percent drop in the average realized price. This was due to a 29 percent increase in our crude oil production. With the acquisition and subsequent exploitation of properties acquired from Repsol (March 2001), we increased our Egyptian production by 41 percent. Strong results on properties we acquired from Fletcher (March 2001) and Phillips (December 2000) helped us increase our Canadian oil production by 76 percent. We also had success on the drilling front, increasing our Australian production by nearly 51 percent with successful development of the Legendre, Gipsy/North Gipsy and Simpson fields. Our crude oil revenues during 2000 nearly doubled, driven by substantially higher oil prices and significant production growth. During 2000, demand for oil increased, helping boost oil prices by nearly 50 percent. Apache was in prime position to take advantage of this pricing environment. We increased our overall oil production by 26 percent. Our acquisition of properties from Shell Offshore Inc. and affiliated Shell entities (Shell Offshore) (May 1999), Collins & Ware (June 2000), and Occidental (August 2000) helped drive domestic oil production up 24 percent. The acquisition of properties from Shell Canada (November 1999) significantly expanded our position in Canada and was a major factor in the 382 percent increase in production in that country. Successful drilling in the Stag field enabled us to increase our Australian production by 46 percent. Our Egyptian oil production decreased 13 percent as a result of the price driven dynamics of certain production sharing contracts. 17 Operating Expenses The table below presents a detail of our expenses. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (IN MILLIONS) Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A): Oil and gas property and equipment........................ $ 760 $ 548 $416 Other assets.............................................. 61 36 27 International impairments................................... 65 Lease operating costs (LOE)................................. 407 255 191 Severance and other taxes................................... 70 59 32 General and administrative expense (G&A).................... 89 76 54 Financing costs, net........................................ 118 106 82 Total.................................................. $1,570 $1,080 $802 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Apaches full cost DD&A expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of producing reserves, production levels, and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs. During 2001, our DD&A per boe increased by $.30 to $6.05. This was primarily the result of higher drilling and finding costs and negative reserve revisions associated with declining prices. During 2000, full cost DD&A expense increased by $.18 to $5.75 per boe due primarily to the cost of oil producing properties acquired from Occidental ($6.74 per boe). Depreciation on other assets increased $25 million in 2001 due to additional facilities acquired from Fletcher (March 2001) and Repsol (March 2001) and the amortization of goodwill. In connection with the adoption of a new accounting principle effective January 1, 2002, we will no longer amortize our goodwill. Instead, it will be assessed for periodic impairment, as discussed in the impairment section below. Impairments We periodically assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment. When an impairment occurs, costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization. In some of our international exploration plays, however, we have not yet established proved reserves. As such, any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings. During 2001, we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in Poland and China by $65 million ($41 million after tax). We are continuing to evaluate our operations in Poland, which may result in additional impairments in 2002. As discussed in Note 2 of Item 14 of this Form 10 K, beginning in 2002, goodwill will be subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment. The Company has not yet determined whether or the extent to which the impairment test will affect the consolidated financial statements. Lease Operating Costs Lease operating costs are driven in part by the type of commodity produced and the level of workovers performed. Oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy. They enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high pricing environments, such as the one we had during the first half of 2001. During 2001, these costs were $3.24 per boe, a $.56 increase from 2000. The increase was primarily driven by three factors. First, our acquisition of Canadian and offshore Gulf of Mexico oil properties carry higher production costs than our other operations. Second, although high commodity prices are beneficial to us overall, they can drive up some of our production costs. Domestically, we had to pay more for service, power and lease fuel costs 18 than we did in 2000. Finally, workover activity was up in the U.S. and Canada. Increases in these two countries were the primary driver of the $.12 increase in LOE per boe in 2000 over 1999 costs. Severance and Other Taxes Severance and other taxes, which generally are based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, increased in 2001 and 2000 due to higher oil and gas revenues. Also contributing to the increases were higher effective production tax rates resulting from a loss of available incentives in Oklahoma due to higher commodity prices and an increase in Canadian Large Corporation Tax from the added production of the properties acquired from Fletcher (March 2001). Administrative, Selling and Other Expenses G&A is influenced by the size of our business. As a result of our active acquisition program, especially in Canada, G&A increased during 2001 and 2000. On an equivalent barrel basis, however, expensed G&A fell 10 percent during 2001 to $.71. This was the result of a significant increase in our production while controlling our costs. During 2000, G&A per boe increased 10 percent to $.79. This was primarily the result of higher incentive compensation driven by Apaches then record performance. Financing Costs, Net Net financing costs increased by 11 percent in 2001 and 30 percent in 2000 due to higher average outstanding borrowings resulting from increased capital expenditures and acquisitions. At year end 2001, approximately 31 percent of our borrowings were subject to fluctuations in short term rates. As a result of the decline in these rates, our weighted average cost of borrowing decreased to 5.9 percent in 2001 from 7.5 percent in 2000. OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (IN THOUSANDS) Exploration and Development: United States.......................................... $ 699,180 $ 495,803 $ 217,476 Canada................................................. 410,345 135,627 45,691 Egypt.................................................. 127,603 84,949 59,808 Australia.............................................. 85,169 73,835 60,976 Other International.................................... 20,838 18,077 21,388 1,343,135 808,291 405,339 Capitalized Interest................................... 56,749 62,000 45,722 Total............................................... $1,399,884 $ 870,291 $ 451,061 Acquisitions: Oil and Gas Properties................................. $ 880,286 $1,324,427 $1,347,704 Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities.......................................... 146,295 94,000 43,502 Goodwill............................................... 197,200 $1,223,781 $1,418,427 $1,391,206 Apaches 2001 acquisition and drilling program added 394.1 MMboe of proved reserves (including revisions) and replaced 314 percent of production. The capital expenditure budget for 2002 is approximately $590 million (excluding acquisitions), including $350 million for North America. Preliminary North American exploration and development expenditures include $60 million in the Southern region, $40 million in the Midcontinent region, $100 million in the Offshore region and $150 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its other international 19 exploration and development expenditures in 2002, exclusive of facilities, to total approximately $240 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions. Cash Dividend Payments Apache paid a total of $20 million in dividends during 2001 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998 and its Series C Preferred Stock issued in May 1999. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will be paid through May 15, 2002, when the shares will automatically convert to common stock (see Note 9 under Item 14 below). Common dividends paid during 2001 totaled $35 million, up five percent from 2000, due to increased common shares outstanding. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 35 consecutive years through 2001. Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. The Company has increased its annual common stock dividend to $.40 per share beginning in 2002. CAPITAL RESOURCES Apaches primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows. Apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows. The Company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow. The Company cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Apaches net cash provided by operating activities during 2001 totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of 27 percent over the $1.5 billion in 2000. This increase was due primarily to higher oil and gas production revenue as a result of full year production from 2000 property acquisitions and properties acquired in 2001. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2000 increased $891 million from 1999 due primarily to higher oil and gas production and prices in 2000. Debt At December 31, 2001, Apache had outstanding debt of $663 million under its credit and commercial paper facilities and a total of $1.6 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2002 through 2096. The 9.25 percent notes totaling $100 million mature on June 1, 2002. These notes and the outstanding debt under credit and commercial paper facilities are classified as long term debt because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance them on a long term basis through rollover of commercial paper or availability under the U.S. portion of the global credit facility and 364 day revolving credit facility. The global credit facility is scheduled to mature in June 2003. The Company is planning to negotiate new credit facilities in the first half of 2002. The Companys debt, including preferred interests of subsidiaries and net of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, was 37 percent of total capitalization at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates, interest payments on the Companys debt for 2002 are projected to be $154 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). Apache has a $500 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. The terms of this facility are substantially the same as those of Apaches global credit facility. The 364 day credit facility will be used, along with the U.S. portion of the global credit facility, to support Apaches commercial paper program, which was increased from $700 million to $1.2 billion in late July 2000. Refer to Note 6 under Item 14 of this Form 10 K for discussion of our debt instruments and related covenants. 20 Preferred Interests of Subsidiaries During 2001, several of our subsidiaries issued a total of $443 million ($441 million, net of issuance costs) of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors, adding to the Companys financial liquidity. We pay a weighted average return to the investors of 123 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR interest rate. These subsidiaries are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements with the $441 million reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet. Stock Transactions On September 13, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared a 10 percent stock dividend, which was paid on January 21, 2002, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2001. No fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares. In connection with the declaration of this stock dividend, a reclassification was made to transfer $545 million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During 2001, the Company repurchased 962,600 shares of common stock to be held in treasury at an average price of $45.09 per share. On August 2, 2000, the Company completed the public offering of 10.1 million shares of Apache common stock, including 1.3 million shares for the underwriters over allotment option, at $44.55 per share and total net proceeds of approximately $434 million. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the acquisitions made during 2000 and repay indebtedness under Apaches commercial paper program. In the first quarter of 2000, the Company bought back 75,900 depository shares, each representing one fiftieth (1/50) of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, at an average price of $34.42 per share. The excess of the purchase price to reacquire the depository shares over the original issuance price is reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. LIQUIDITY The Company had $36 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2001, slightly down from $37 million at December 31, 2000. Apaches ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from 1.14 at December 31, 2000, to 1.34 at December 31, 2001. The Company had $103 million in short term securities (U.S. Government Agency Notes) at December 31, 2001, a portion of which is currently available to fund operating and exploration activities, and will be available to reduce long term debt after August, 2002. Apache believes that cash on hand, net cash generated from operations, short term investments, and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility and 364 day credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the Companys financial obligations to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2001, Apaches available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility and 364 day revolving credit facility was $839 million. 21 The Companys contractual obligations relate primarily to long term debt, preferred interests of subsidiaries, operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001. Refer to the indicated footnote to the Companys consolidated financial statements under Item 14 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these obligations. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operations.

The Company currently includes such costs in the amortizable base of its oil and gas properties. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003, the Company will record a liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation, which will be capitalized as part of the oil and gas properties carrying amount. See Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion. Our liquidity could be impacted by a downgrade of the credit rating for our senior unsecured long term debt by Standard & Poors to BBB or lower and by Moodys to Baa3 or lower; however, we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. If our debt were to receive such a downgrade, our subsidiaries that issued the preferred interests described in Note 12 to the accompanying financial statements could be in violation of their covenants which may require them to redeem some of the preferred interests as described in that Note. FUTURE TRENDS Apaches strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: exploiting our existing asset base; acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and investing in high potential exploration prospects. In order to maximize financial flexibility during a period of highly volatile natural gas prices coupled with a faltering U.S. economy, Apaches present plans are to reduce 2002 worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately $590 million from $1.4 billion in 2001. Any excess cash flow will be used to reduce debt until such time that we elect either to increase drilling expenditures should the commodity price environment improve, or to pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices. 22 Exploiting Existing Asset Base Apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while reducing operating costs per unit. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers, recompletions and moderate risk drilling, while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs. Given the significant acquisitions completed over the last two years, Apaches inventory of exploitation opportunities has never been larger. Acquiring Properties to Which We Can Add Incremental Value Apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. Recently exorbitant acquisition prices have caused Apache to sideline its acquisition activities until appropriate opportunities arise at reasonable prices. Investing in High Potential Exploration Prospects Apache seeks to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although higher risk, offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. A critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. Rating upgrades on Apaches senior unsecured long term debt received from Moodys and Standard & Poors illustrate our commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet and building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK The Companys major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its United States and Canadian natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $17.35 per barrel to a high of $27.67 per barrel during 2001. Average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $2.24 per Mcf to a monthly high of $7.33 per Mcf during the same period. Based on the Companys 2001 worldwide oil production levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by $54 million. Based on the Companys 2001 worldwide gas production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by $41 million. If oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, do not exceed the "ceiling". This ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts. Write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities. 23 The Company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Companys price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated in Note 4 under Item 14 below, the Company terminated all of its derivative instruments in October and November 2001. Apache sells all of its Egyptian crude oil and natural gas to the EGPC for U.S. dollars. Deteriorating economic conditions during 2001 in Egypt have lessened the availability of U.S. dollars resulting in a gradual decline in timeliness of receipts from EGPC. INTEREST RATE RISK The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately 69 percent of the Companys debt. At December 31, 2001, total debt included $700 million of floating rate debt. As a result, Apaches annual interest costs in 2002 will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately 31 percent of its total debt outstanding at December 31, 2001. Additionally, our preferred interests of subsidiaries of $441 million is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10 percent change in the floating interest rate, including our preferred interests in subsidiaries, (approximately 22 basis points) would be approximately $2 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2001 or 2000. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Companys cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Reported cash flow from Canadian operations is measured in Canadian dollars and converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. A portion of Apaches debt in Canada is denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, is adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end. This unrealized adjustment is recorded as other revenues (losses). Substantially all of the Companys international transactions, outside of Canada and Australia, are denominated in U.S. dollars. A 10 percent weakening of each of the Canadian dollar, Polish zloty or Australian dollar will result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $17 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2001 or 2000. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although 24 Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
